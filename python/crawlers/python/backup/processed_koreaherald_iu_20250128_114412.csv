Huawei and IUCN Launch Tech4Nature Project to Protect Kenya's Coral Reefs,"NAIROBI, Kenya, Jan. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Huawei, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and local partner Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) have launched a Tech4Nature project to monitor and protect coral reef and biodiversity in Kenya's Kisite-Mpunguti Marine Park and Reserve. Aligned with Huawei's TECH4ALL initiative and the IUCN Green List, the objective of the three-year project is to strengthen monitoring and management efficacy of the protected area. Located on the southern coast of Kenya, Kisite-Mpunguti Marine Park and Reserve faces a number of nature conservation challenges. These include: ""Tech4Nature is an expansive project that falls under Huawei's digital inclusion initiative TECH4ALL, where we look at ways to implement technology and innovation in various sectors of our day today life and improving global standards and ensure that we have a sustainable way of life in the world,"" said Khadija Mohamed, Director of Media and Government Relations for Huawei Kenya. Underwater cameras, photogrammetry, and audio monitoring technologies will be deployed to monitor marine life, including the biomass and population of parrot fish. In many coral reef ecosystems, parrot fish are a keystone species that, due to their diet, help prevent coral from being smothered by seaweed and algae. The solution will also monitor substrate cover in the reef ecosystems, seagrass cover, and the occurrence of green turtles and bottlenose dolphins, which are classified on the IUCN Red List as endangered and vulnerable, respectively. ""The technology we are introducing is a groundbreaking development for marine conservation in Kenya. It will serve as the first monitoring tool for data collection, analysis, and management in a marine protected area. Additionally, this innovation presents an opportunity to assist the park in attaining IUCN Green List certification, aligning with the sustainability goals valued by tourists and ensuring that future generations can continue to benefit from our marine parks,"" said Innocent Kabenga, Country Representative for the IUCN Kenya Country Office. AI trained to recognize specific target species by sight or sound will provide real-time data-driven insights into the behaviors, populations, and distribution of biodiversity in the reserve and reef ecosystem. The system will also be able to identify boats used for illegal fishing, and send alerts for rangers to intervene in near real time. A digital power solution and improved network connectivity covering the park and watch tower will enable the rapid transmission of collected data to a cloud server for analysis by AI. The project will be implemented in partnership with Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and Wildlife Research and Training Institute (WRTI). Based on the project's data-driven insights, the Tech4Nature partners will be able to develop targeted conservation measures for the reserve. ""For us to deliver our mandate of protecting and conserving our wildlife in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, you have to understand your resources very well. We are partnering with Huawei and IUCN to deploy underwater cameras to acquire some data on marine mammal, corals, and fisheries to make informed decisions. The advantage of this technology it can be deployed in wider area that we couldn't patrol every single day to get data for day and night for us to make good, informed decisions,"" said Adan Kala, Senior Assistant Director, Coast Conservation Area, Kenya Wildlife Service. In addition, the project will include community outreach to raise awareness about biodiversity changes over time and the presence of different species, including those that are threatened, vulnerable, or endangered. The site will be assessed against the IUCN Green List Standard, with the goal being that the reserve obtains Green List certification. About Tech4Nature Huawei and IUCN launched the Tech4Nature global partnership in 2020 to scale up success in nature conservation through technological innovation. Aligned with Huawei's TECH4ALL initiative and the IUCN Green List, Tech4Nature has supported 11 flagship projects in 8 countries with tailored solutions to conservation challenges.

The K-pop girl group won in the Digital Song Division category at the two-day event that started Saturday at the Mizuho PayPay Dome in Fukuoka, Japan. The Sunday ceremony awarded artists in the Album Division category.

The prerecorded event will air Monday at midnight and Tuesday at 1:20 a.m. on JTBC. While 2024 was a year brimming with new sounds resonating across genres for K-pop, aespa clinched the ""Song of the Year"" award, achieving the feat three years after the quartet notched the rookie awards in 2022. ""Supernova,"" the lead track of the band's first LP ""Armageddon"" released on May 27, topped the Melon streaming chart for six weeks straight.

Fake news about US banning anti-Yoon ralliers resurfaces online,"False rumors and unconfirmed reports are spreading online about the US government’s supposed crackdown on anyone who has openly criticized the now-impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol. Online communities, particularly those frequently by far-right supporters of the besieged leader, are sharing a debunked fake news report from 2018 about the US Central Intelligence Agency’s plans to permanently ban from entry anyone who has been reported to be anti-American or participated in an anti-American protest. It also claimed that those reported to be anti-American will also be banned from sending their children to the US for education. The US Embassy in Korea at the time confirmed the report to be false, telling local broadcaster JTBC it was ""not worth responding to."" Curiously, this debunked fake news story has resurfaced in Korea, amid the tumultuous events following Yoon’s ill-fated declaration of martial law on Dec. 3 and his subsequent impeachment. This has polarized public opinion into two camps: a majority condemning Yoon and a minority going all out to defend him. Yoon is currently undergoing a criminal investigation on charges of insurrection and abuse of power while also being subject to an impeachment trial. He declared martial law on Dec. 3 and is suspected of ordering the arrest of prominent political figures and civilians, many of whom have publicly spoken against him. On the diplomatic front, Yoon, a conservative, has maintained a pro-American stance and supports friendly ties with Japan. His supporters often accuse opponents of being anti-American and pro-North Korean. Some online platforms with far-right political views have also been publishing unconfirmed claims about supposed actions by the US government. For instance, a website known for unsourced and unverified far-right conspiracy theories recently claimed that Washington has issued a warning against ""leftwing professors who thoughtlessly expressed political views and decried the political situation without context,"" in a clear reference to scholars who openly condemned Yoon’s martial law imposition. The claim cites no statements sources from the Korean or US governments, but instead references anonymous comments on local online communities. The website's unverified claims also include the supposed rigging of parliamentary elections, which was alleged by the president but dismissed by a police investigation as baseless. In the aftermath of the anti-Yoon protests, several members of online communities with pro-conservative political inclinations were found to be encouraging each other to report celebrities like IU to the CIA. The celebrities in question had publicly expressed support for demonstrations against Yoon. They claimed that just reporting the celebrities to the CIA as spies would lead to a criminal investigation, which would hinder them from activities in the US or even entering the country. A person claiming to be a supporter of the president's People Power Party said he or she has filed a similar report against Daegu Mayor Hong Joon-pyo, citing exhaustion with Hong's talk about an early presidential election in case Yoon's impeachment is confirmed and he is removed from office. The CIA collects and analyzes foreign intelligence and conducts covert actions, but is not the government body authorized to grant entry to the US. According to the US government, the Department of Homeland Security and officials with the US Customs and Border Protection agency at the port-of-entry have the authority to permit entry into the US. The US State Department can impose visa restrictions on individuals under Section 212 (a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and National Act. The particular section of the law stipulates the possibility of visa restrictions on numerous grounds, such as involvement in the misuse of commercial hardware to target or unlawfully surveil, harass, suppress or intimidate individuals, but expressing one's political inclination is not among them.",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10021683,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/news/cms/2024/12/23/news-p.v1.20241223.be246a2a1a17461192eadd1c587d3c99_T1.jpg?type=h&h=240,Korea Herald,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.,2024-12-23,iu,Social,IU Reportedly Targeted by US CIA Online Harassment,"""IU Faces Growing Backlash as Online Trolls Urge her to Cooperate with CIA Investigation Amid Anti-Yoon Protests""",3,"This article mentions IU as a celebrity who has been targeted by far-right supporters with false reports to the CIA, but it does not provide any direct information or quotes from IU.",General category assigned after detailed analysis of Level 3 involvement,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.
[Herald Review] 2NE1 returns better than ever,"“Come Back Home” echoed through the Olympic Hall in Olympic Park, Seoul, on Sunday evening, sparking ecstatic cheers from fans as all four members of the iconic K-pop girl group 2NE1 took to the stage for their first concert in over a decade. The group, comprising Sandara Park, CL, Park Bom and Minzy, dazzled in their signature eclectic outfits that have long defined their unique style. CL sported a striking red jacket with a large red ribbon, while Sandara Park showcased a bold bolero with exaggerated shoulders. Kicking off ""Welcome Back,"" the last of their three concerts -- “Come Back Home” and “Fire” were the other two -- many devoted members of the group's fandom, known as Blackjacks, were moved to tears. “It’s been a long while, Blackjacks! Shout out ‘Let’s play’ if you’re ready for the next song,” said Sandara Park, encouraging the crowd. The proximity of the main stage to the audience amplified the concert's immersive atmosphere. Despite the years apart, the quartet delivered a powerful performance, revisiting classic hits like “Can’t Nobody,” “Falling In Love” and “I Don’t Care.” The choreography was vigorous, demanding much more energy than the routines of some of today's K-pop girl groups. The youngest member Minzy, who in the past was somewhat overshadowed by other members' talents, seemed to have blossomed with vocals and dancing that truly stood out. Following the first segment of the concert, video tributes from major K-pop artists — including IU, NewJeans, Ive, Twice, aespa and Stray Kids — played on screens, celebrating 2NE1's 15th anniversary concert. CL then captivated the audience with solo performances of “The Baddest Female” and “MTBD,” commanding the stage in a long white fur robe before dramatically tossing it aside. In the next segment, 2NE1 donned black outfits to perform heartfelt ballads, including “Missing You,” “It Hurts,” “If I Were You” and “Lonely.” A nostalgic video montage showcased 2NE1's trainee days, working hard to become K-pop idols in 2008, alongside their journey as a group since their 2009 debut. The concert reached its zenith with the explosive performance of their hit number “I Am the Best.” The audience erupted in excitement, dancing and singing along, while the members made their way through the crowd, connecting with fans up close. “This venue is significant to us as we held our first concert here. It’s also special to celebrate our 15th anniversary together as a group,” Sandara Park said. Park Bom added, “We are incredibly thankful for all the love and support (we received) while preparing for this concert. We are overjoyed to finally perform for you.” “I know it must have felt like an endless wait, but thank you for your patience. Meeting you for the first time in 10 years brings back wonderful memories,” Sandara Park continued. “We aimed to evoke nostalgia with this concert, showcasing what a classic 2NE1 show looks like. We felt so much positive energy from all of you, and we hope you felt it too,” CL said. Sandara Park hinted at future plans, saying, “Initially, we planned a one-day concert, but tickets sold out so quickly that we added two more days. Shouldn’t we consider an encore concert? We’ll try to book a larger venue for that!” 2NE1 is now set to embark on a tour across Asia, with 15 concerts planned in nine cities, starting with a show in Manila scheduled for Nov. 16.",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3488719,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/10/07/20241007050606_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,Korea Herald,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.,2024-10-07,iu,Social,"""IU Welcomes Back 2NE1 to Concert Stage""",IU pays tribute to 2NE1's legacy alongside fellow K-pop icons in emotional video tribute performances at their comeback concert.,3,IU is mentioned indirectly as an example of a major K-pop artist who participated in the video tributes celebrating 2NE1's 15th anniversary concert.,General category assigned after detailed analysis of Level 3 involvement,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.
"Korean bands get their day in the sun, finally","Bands are dominating local charts at the moment, led by JYP Entertainment's pop-rock sensation Day6. With four of their old and new tracks among the top 10 on Melon’s music chart as of Friday -- “Happy” and “Welcome to the Show” claiming the No. 1 and No. 3 spots and “Melt Down” and “Time of Our Life” holding strong at No. 4 and No. 6, respectively -- it’s clear the Korean music scene is in the midst of a band craze. Day6 is no newcomer. But it is only now that it has reached this level, nine years since its debut in 2015. While Day6 has long been favored by local music enthusiasts, this is the first time it has achieved such broad mainstream appeal. Among all-female bands, four-member project band QWER is leading the rock genre. “My Name is Malgeum” from the band's second EP, “Algorithm’s Blossom,” which released Sept. 23, currently ranks No. 2 on the Melon chart, the higher than any K-pop girl group. This places QWER above aespa’s hit “Supernova” at No. 4 and NewJeans’ “How Sweet” at No. 8. The main reason for the surge in the popularity of such bands seems to be growing fatigue with the high-octane, addictive hooks typical of K-pop idol groups. In contrast, the music of such bands is considered easier to listen to. “The currently popular band music follows traditional melodic structures that allow listeners to naturally feel the emotional contours throughout the song. It’s a familiar pattern that has long been recognized for evoking pleasure,” said music critic Lim Hee-yun. Day6, for example, employs familiar, catchy melodies and combines them with universally relatable lyrics. “Time of Our Life,” for example, offers encouragement to young people, with lines such as, “Let’s write a beautiful chapter of our youth together.” “Day6’s songs don’t convey aggressive messages or complex themes. Rather, they resonate as anthems for a weary generation,” said music critic Kim Do-heon. “With the members actively involved in writing and composing their songs, they’re gaining even more love for their authenticity.” Japanese subculture and anime content have also influenced the rise in popularity of bands in Korea. Local bands often feature arrangements and melodies similar to Japanese rock bands that create anime soundtracks. “The popularity of Japanese anime films like ‘The First Slam Dunk’ and ‘Suzume’ seems to have influenced Korean bands' music. The youthful passion and energy in these films, combined with their unique, refreshing imagery, often accompanied by rock music, have contributed to this trend,” Lim added. “As Japanese content continues to gain traction among younger generations, there’s a growing preference for Japanese-style rock and melodies.” It’s not only K-pop bands that are gaining recognition — indie bands are also experiencing a surge in popularity. Local indie rock band Silica Gel sold out three concerts at Jangchung Gymnasium in Seoul in May, a feat rarely achieved even by popular K-pop groups. Notably, Silica Gel has become a band to reckon with based on its music alone; the band does not appear on TV shows, which has often been the fastest path to stardom for underground musicians. Another indie band, Wave to Earth, currently boasts over 8.19 million monthly listeners on Spotify, a figure that is 1.5 times higher than IU’s 5.3 million, as of Thursday. IU is one of the most successful female K-pop solo artists today. “Short-form videos on social media have helped indie musicians in the band scene gain immense popularity. The fan base for niche band music has snowballed as content is shared among enthusiasts who appreciate less mainstream sounds,” Lim said.",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3853122,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/10/03/20241003050229_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,Korea Herald,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.,2024-10-04,iu,Social,IU's Concerts Boost Indie Band Popularity,"""IU is breaking barriers as a Korean pop sensation, solidifying her position as one of the most influential K-pop artists of all time.""",3,IU is mentioned as an example or referenced in context to illustrate the growing popularity of indie bands.,General category assigned after detailed analysis of Level 3 involvement,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.
AI TOOL LAUNCHED TO PROTECT NATURE DURING INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT,"SMI Nature Risk Tool uses data and AI to inform infrastructure projects, promoting sustainable development and environmental protection. Can analyse land anywhere in the world, offering expert-reviewed descriptions of habitats and biomes. Identifies protected species early in the site selection phase, allowing for protective measures to be integrated into development plans. Successfully trialled by organisations including the World Bank, BP, KPMG, WWF, Barclays, HSBC, and the Blue Dot Network. NEW YORK, Sept. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Sustainable Markets Initiative and AECOM launch a groundbreaking AI tool designed to protect nature during infrastructure development. The Nature Risk Tool analyses any piece of land globally providing detailed insights into habitats and biomes to help planners and policymakers create sustainable infrastructure that safeguards the natural environment. With infrastructure development set to surge, driven by population and economic growth, the Nature Risk Tool will combat a reality that infrastructure development often leads to habitat loss, biodiversity decline, pollution, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. Over the past 50 years, wildlife populations have decreased by an average of 60%[1], with infrastructure development being a significant factor. Powered by AECOM, and using datasets from the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), the SMI Nature Risk Tool enables infrastructure investors and promoters to analyse any piece of land globally (at a scale of metres), providing expert-reviewed descriptions of the location's habitat and biomes early in the site selection process. The Nature Risk Tool then evaluates a project's impact on the environment and suggests mitigation strategies, offering potential solutions or environmental protection measures. This information can be used to inform planner and policymaker decisions on creating infrastructure that promotes sustainable development and protects the natural environment. Importantly, the tool also aligns with the TNFD framework, enabling users to utilise the data for the TNFD LEAP process. For example, if a protected species is found by the tool on the proposed site, early identification during the site selection phase allows for either ruling out that site or integrating protective measures into the development process to ensure the species' continued protection. The tool also aligns with the TNDF framework, enabling users to utilise the data for the TNFD LEAP process. Jennifer Jordan Saifi, CEO, Sustainable Markets Initiative, said: ""Nature is the engine of our economy, which is why it lies at the heart of our mandate, the Terra Carta. It is central to providing us with solutions for a sustainable future. ""Partnering with AECOM, we have been able to demonstrate the significant impact that infrastructure development can have on global biodiversity. ""This is why I am proud to be launching the SMI Nature Risk Tool, something we hope will have many use cases and that will act as a powerful resource for developers and policymakers worldwide as we work collectively to protect and restore harmony with Nature."" Troy Rudd, Chief Executive Officer and Head of the Measurement and Transparency Task Force, AECOM, added: ""We are incredibly excited about this partnership with the Sustainable Market Initiative. By combining our expertise in infrastructure consulting with SMI's commitment to sustainability, we are setting a new standard for how projects can be planned and executed with nature and biodiversity at the forefront. ""This collaboration not only enhances our ability to deliver innovative solutions but also underscores our shared vision for a more sustainable and resilient future."" The tool will be employed at the project initiation stage to support site selection and feasibility studies, enhance decision-making and efficiency, and significantly minimise impacts on nature and biodiversity. By bringing the tool in at an early stage, it will provide critical insights into project risks at key decision-making milestones, allowing leaders and planners to pivot and mitigate risks before a project is underway.

[Herald Review] IU wraps up 1st world tour 'HEREH' at Seoul World Cup Stadium,"K-pop sensation IU wrapped up her first world tour, ‘HEREH,’ with an unforgettable finale Sunday at the Seoul World Cup Stadium. She made a striking entrance on a swing-like lift, dressed in a sparkling coral mini dress and a white headset, kicking off the show with “Holssi,” the first track from a captivating setlist that spanned over two hours. IU took an audience of 50,000 on a mesmerizing journey, performing “Ah Puh” amidst a stunning display of whale and jellyfish-shaped lanterns carried by dancers. While the open-air venue posed some challenges with sound delays that slightly detracted from the immersive experience, IU skillfully countered this with a variety of creative props and stage effects. The second section of the show began with a little girl awakening onstage, setting the scene for a magical moment when a star, carried by a drone, guided her to IU, who reappeared on the swing lift adorned with colorful flowers to sing “Celebrity.” She then flew over the venue to the stage front, where her fans, donning blue flower headpieces, surprised her during “Blueming.” “It’s wonderful to see you up close. Your affectionate gazes fill my heart with love. Thank you for this surprise event. I included this song just for this encore show,” IU said. She expressed her desire to perform “I Stan U” surrounded by her audience, adding, “Thank you for starting your autumn with my concert. Just as you cheer for me, I hope to be that kind of audience for you as well.” During the concert, IU also debuted a new song, “Bye Summer,” showcasing her skills on a crystal blue electric guitar. “This tour felt like summer lasted forever. However, I want to say it’s been the best summer because I shared it with all of you. This song feels fitting for a day that marks the end of summer,” she explained. The concert peaked with 1,000 drones illuminating the night sky during “Last Fantasy.” Dressed like a fairy tale princess wearing a flowing white gown and a crown, IU created a magical atmosphere enhanced by fireworks. A giant Tweety balloon, reminiscent of her “Shopper” music video, floated above as she performed the lead track from her latest EP ""The Winning."" As the concert drew to a close, IU reflected on the emotional weight of the moment. “This is the last moment of my world tour, and it makes me feel so sentimental. I hope you achieve victories, big and small, until we meet again,” she said, transitioning to “Love Wins All,” the final song on her setlist. Accompanied by an orchestra and a choir, her soulful performance left the audience mesmerized, inspiring clapping atypical of K-pop concerts. Sunday's show was also her 100th concert. “It feels surreal that today’s final show of my first world tour is also my 100th concert. I was surprised a fan was counting all my concerts — something even my parents don’t do. This world tour was possible because of your love and support. I promise to return with more great music,” she concluded.",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3479672,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/09/23/20240923050500_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,Korea Herald,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.,2024-09-23,iu,Music,"""IU Wraps Up World Tour 'HEREH' in Seoul.""","IU Announces Highly Anticipated Collaboration with Rising R&B Artist, Charli XCX, for HEREH World Tour",1,"As the main subject of the article, IU is the primary focus of the story.","The article primarily discusses IU's performance and concert activities as part of her K-pop world tour 'HEREH', including the setlist, stage effects, props, and audience interactions.

IU to unveil 6th EP ‘The Winning’ next month,"Singer-songwriter and actress IU will release her sixth mini album, “The Winning,” on Feb. 20, according to Edam Entertainment. The artist’s new album is the first in two years and two months after the release of her special extended play, “Pieces,"" in December 2021. The teaser clip of IU’s upcoming album uploaded to her official YouTube channel shows the artist with long bleached hair, wearing a red outfit. IU is seen spraying a red-colored spray at the camera and gazing into the camera against a light green background. The artist had hinted when she starred in Suga of BTS’ show, “Suchwita,” that her mini album is likely to carry five to six tracks that she will continue to infuse with stories about her age. Prior to the official release of her new album, IU dropped a single from the upcoming album, “Love Wins All,” on Jan. 24. The single shot to No. 1 on major local music charts such as Melon, Genie and Bugs, within just an hour of its release, which is the fastest achievement recorded by a female artist since August 2021. The much-anticipated music video for “Love Wins All,” featuring V of BTS, has surpassed 30 million views on YouTube as of Tuesday. However, the music video faced controversy as some argued that it demeaned those with disabilities. In the music video, IU is depicted as having a hearing impairment and V a visual impairment. They both run away from a cube-shaped spacecraft that symbolizes oppression and discrimination. IU and V then find a camcorder, through the filter of which they are able to view each other as people without disabilities. Some argued that these scenes are based on discriminatory views that people with disabilities necessarily admire and fantasize about being people without disabilities.",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3315439,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/01/30/20240130000555_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,Korea Herald,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.,2024-01-30,iu,Promotion,IU's Sixth Mini Album 'The Winning' Released Feb. 20,"""IU Announces Highly Anticipated Debut as a Collaborator on Upcoming Album""",2,"IU is mentioned as a key figure in the context of releasing her new album and single, affecting the story with her music video.","The article primarily focuses on promoting IU's upcoming music release, including the teaser clip upload to her official YouTube channel and the achievements of the single ""Love Wins All,"" such as its chart performance and views on YouTube.

Relais & Châteaux chefs pledge to stop serving eel with immediate effect to prevent its extinction,"Working in concert with Ethic Ocean, the Association's World Culinary Council will lobby European ministers to protect biodiversity PARIS, Dec. 5, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The members of Relais & Châteaux's World Culinary Council has voted to immediately remove eel from their own menus and are sending a call to action to the rest of the group's 580 hotels and restaurants to do the same, after its NGO partner Ethic Ocean launched an alert that public authorities must urgently listen to scientists who recommend suspending European eel fishing. To view the Multimedia News Release, please click: https://www.multivu.com/players/uk/9230451-relais-chateaux-chefs-pledge-stop-serving-eel-prevent-extinction/ The European eel (Anguilla anguilla), which is featured in menus all over the world–and revered in certain French, Spanish, Belgian, Dutch and Japanese culinary cultures–is considered critically endangered and features on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Over the last 20 years, European scientists from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) have been warning about all the causes of the alarming decline of this species–but for the last three years, they have recommended suspending fishing. In this context, the 21 Relais & Châteaux chefs elected to the Association's World Culinary Council gathered in October and voted to approve an immediate ban of European eel from its menus. In partnership with Ethic Ocean, Relais & Châteaux calls on the 27 European Union ministers to hear this chef mobilization and scientific recommendation in order to take the necessary measures this December to safeguard this species. The effort follows a similar approach taken by the Association, in 2009, to save the bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) stocks in the North-East Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, which were close to collapsing. This action contributed to public mobilization around this species, which encouraged legislators to enact management measures adapted to the situation of the state of the stock. A Variety of Issues The situation with eels is very alarming because this species suffers from a numerous challenges including water pollution (particularly rivers), habitat destruction, dams that impede their biological cycle and illegal fishing, which has created a black market, fetching up to €5,000 per kilo. Eels are the only fish that are targeted at their juvenile stage, on top of the fact that it takes them a long time to reach reproductive maturity. While it is urgent to suspend eel fishing today, it is crucial that the public authorities take the necessary measures to fight against the other causes of the decline of this species. Mauro Colagreco, Vice President, Chefs of Relais & Châteaux and therefore leader of the World Culinary Council, and chef-owner of the three-Michelin-starred restaurant Mirazur in the South of France, said, ""Chefs have a critical role to play: we can stop the demand. We have a chance to protect eels from becoming extinct, and of preserving biodiversity to allow future generations to continue to enjoy them, but only if we act now. As the world's largest network of chefs, Relais & Châteaux hopes to save this species."" Gastronomy: Dependent on Nature The World Culinary Council–an international committee of 21 chefs from across the Relais & Châteaux network–had gathered over October 8-10, 2023, under the Association's president, Laurent Gardinier. Laurent Gardinier said: ""We have an acute understanding that Relais & Châteaux, and our very art de vivre, is dependent on nature. We must lead in sustainability to protect the ecosystems and biodiversity that our culinary and travel experiences rely on. It is these experiences that move our guests emotionally. And this would not be possible without nature."" A Vehicle for Change The World Culinary Council wishes to draw attention to the plight of eels. Relais & Châteaux has had a partnership with Ethic Ocean since 2009 and regularly unites its members around actions in favor of the environment, especially marine biodiversity (for example, World Oceans Day). Gilles Boeuf, president of Ethic Ocean, said, ""I am happy to see the Relais & Châteaux association support this alert, which aims, above all, to preserve an exceptional species that reflects humanity's relationship with the environment. This cause to save the eel touches on many biodiversity issues. Let's act before it's too late.""

"[Herald Design Forum 2023] Italian architect, designer Cristina Celestino discusses importance of relationships in design","Italian architect and designer Cristina Celestino, delivering a presentation titled “Intertwining Beauty and Sustainability: From Color to Materiality” at the Herald Design Forum 2023 at the Shilla Seoul on Tuesday, discussed how the design and planning of spaces stem from the relationships established in the design process. These relationships involve engagement with local history and culture, and a collaborative partnership with skilled local artisans, she told the audience. Celestino, the founder of the brand Attico Design, said she always takes the broader context of intellectual, cultural and material coexistence into consideration, adding that she tries to incorporate landscape into her interior designs. When working for a hotel in a coastal city in Italy, she collaborated with an artisan specializing in a tile called Thalassa, which she used in her designs. ""Wherever I work and whoever I work with, I research the local history in depth and work with skilled artisans, because regional character is a very important factor,"" she said. ""I learned a lot by working with established brands and local artisans ... I put my utmost (into creating) even small items,"" she said, sharing her philosophy. A graduate of the IUAV School of Architecture in Venice, Celestino, 43, created Attico Design and established her studio in Milan in 2013. Works by Celestino and her studio range from residential, hospitality and commercial projects to creative direction and product design. Celestino has been featured in prominent publications, including in the AD 100 best designers list, Domus, Elle Decor, Wallpaper, AD, Ideat and Vogue.

Why it's so hard for same-sex couples and single women to have kids in S. Korea,"First lesbian couple expecting baby had to travel overseas for sperm donation as Korea restricts women without a husband from accessing assisted reproductive technology Kim Gyu-jin and Kim Se-yeon held their wedding ceremony during the 2023 Seoul Queer Culture Festival earlier this month in central Seoul. Hundreds at the festival congratulated the wife-wife couple on their union -- even though it is not legally recognized by South Korean law -- as well as on the baby they are expecting. The Kim couple revealed that their quest to have a child required a trip to a foreign country, Belgium, as accessing a sperm donor had not been possible for them in South Korea. In addition to same-sex couples, single women also face significant obstacles here when it comes to accessing sperm donations, largely due to a combination of legal restrictions and customary practices within the medical community. No husband, no sperm? Three years ago, Japan-born TV personality Fujita Sayuri became a mother through intrauterine insemination (IUI) via sperm donation. Though she'd lived in South Korea for most of her adult life, she had to move back to Japan for the pregnancy, because sperm donation was “illegal” for someone like her lacking a legal husband, she said. She is now back in Korea, raising her son here. Her story raised questions about whether the South Korean system needs to adapt to changing concepts of family, as more people are choosing not to marry, but still want to start a family of their own with the help of science. In South Korea’s Bioethics and Safety Act, Article 24 -- which deals with consent concerning producing embryos -- states that the medical institution shall obtain the written consent of the donor and the spouses of both the donor and the person undergoing in vitro fertilization when extracting the sperm or eggs, provided the donor has a spouse. The clause was revised to its current version in the mid-2000s after high-profile stem cell researcher Hwang Woo-suk was found to have fabricated a series of stem cell experiments, during which his female subordinates were pressured to donate eggs for research. Amid the controversy that followed, the Ministry of Health and Welfare issued a statement that, contrary to Fujita’s understanding, it is technically not illegal for a woman without a husband to be inseminated with donated sperm. The clause mandates a spouse’s consent only if the donor has one, the ministry explained, and does not require spousal consent from an unmarried person. The reality, however, is that it is still impossible to find a doctor who would perform the procedure on a single -- at least by legal standards -- woman. An ethical guideline set by the Korean Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology tells its over 4,500 members to conduct assisted reproductive procedures, including IUI and IVF, on legally married couples only, or those in common-law marriages. Last year, the National Human Rights Commission of Korea recommended that the group revise the guideline. Appearing before lawmakers at the National Assembly last October, KSOG chief Park Joong-shin said that the guideline stems from potential legal complications that could arise from assisted pregnancies, not doctors’ opposing the prospect of unconventional families. “We reviewed the case after the human rights commission’s recommendation, but we were unable to revise the guideline, because the law is based on the definition of subfertility within a married couple,” he said, adding that assisted reproduction technology is considered a ""subfertility"" treatment in South Korea. He was referring to subsection 11 of Article 2 in the Mother and Child Health Act, which states that the term subfertility refers to ""a state in which a woman is unable to conceive even after one year has elapsed though the couple has a normal sex life in a state in which they do not use birth control.” The official English translation provided by the Korean Law Information Center has a ""woman,"" instead of a ""married couple,"" being unable to conceive, leaving out the part about having the status of being in a marriage or common-law marriage. The same act provides the legal grounds for providing government subsidies for assisted reproductive technology treatment to married couples or those in common-law marriages, but excluding single women. Finding donors Even if there was a clinic willing to help women seeking to have a baby but who do not have legal married status, there remains another hurdle – where to get the sperm. The Bioethics Act bans anyone from profiting from sperm donation. Access to publicly donated sperm is limited to those who are entitled to receiving the government’s subfertility subsidies. This situation has ailed the Kims: both being Korean, the lesbian couple first considered conceiving with a sperm donation here. But they gave up when they saw single friends’ requests to get IVF rejected by local clinics that operate their own small banks of donated sperm. There is no state-run public sperm bank in Korea. “Korean hospitals only provide sperm for those legally married or in common-law marriages, which rules us out. Since we cannot afford to otherwise pay for a sperm donation, the only option left was to ask one of our friends (to donate his sperm to us), which was not easy,” Kim Gyu-jin said in a recent interview with local media. So they decided to fly to Belgium. As in most countries, the traditional concept of a heterosexual nuclear family consisting of a father, a mother and one to two children is rapidly changing. Some people choose to opt out of having kids, while others don't want a heterosexual partner. Some don't want to marry at all. A 2021 Realmeter survey of 1,000 adults across the country showed that 57 percent of respondents supported childbirth outside of marriage, while 43 percent were against it. About 67 percent of women and 53 percent of men said it was “okay either way” whether they got married or not. On why they supported pregnancy outside of marriage, 66 percent said “personal choices should be respected,” while 48 percent said “one should not have to get married to have children.” With public opinion shifting amid the world’s lowest birth rate, South Korea appears to be inching toward a more open-minded approach to women and childbirth.",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3164419,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/07/10/20230710000513_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,Korea Herald,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.,2023-07-10,iu,Social,IU Fights for Reproductive Rights of Single Women in Korea,IU's Unwavering Support Sparks Hope for a More Inclusive South Korea as LGBTQ+ Rights Continue to Gain Momentum.,3,"The article mentions IU as a representative of the changing concepts of family, but does not provide any direct quotes or actions by her.",General category assigned after detailed analysis of Level 3 involvement,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.

Huawei and Partners Explore Conserving Nature with Technology at Huawei Connect 2022 Paris,"PARIS, Oct. 19, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The third stop on the global tour for HUAWEI CONNECT 2022 kicked off in Paris this Monday. Themed ""Unleash Digital"", the major themes explored by industry leaders, experts, and partners from the ICT and green development sectors included unleashing digital productivity, promoting Europe's green and digital transition, and building stronger digital ecosystems. At the event, Huawei hosted an afternoon session and panel discussion exploring the vital role of technology in supporting nature conservation in Europe, during which it introduced the Tech4Nature – Solutions in Focus publication. Developed under the Tech4Nature partnership between IUCN and Huawei, Tech4Nature – Solutions in Focus analyzes the best practices of using technology to achieve effective nature conservation outcomes, with the publication detailing 22 projects in 19 countries. ""There is a clear growing momentum and buy-in from the conservation community to use more technology but also to develop and create new ways it can be applied. The appropriate deployment of technology will help ensure more sustained benefits from its application to achieve fair and effective conservation action,"" said James Hardcastle, Head of IUCN Protected and Conserved Areas. At the session, the NGO Rainforest Connection outlined the various Nature Guardian projects it is running in Europe with Huawei and local partners in ocean, wetland, and forest ecosystems. ""Rainforest Connection uses AI and big data analytics powered by Huawei Cloud to monitor biodiversity and protect ecosystems around the world. By harnessing the power of sound, we are able to track thousands of species globally and automatically detect the presence of illegal activities,"" said Bourhan Yassin, CEO of Rainforest Connection. Examples of projects currently running in Europe using acoustics technologies include monitoring dolphins and whales off the Irish south coast and studying the impact of climate change on bird and amphibian life in Austria's wetlands. Nature Guardian projects in Italy and Greece are focusing on preventing illegal logging, poaching, and other damaging human activities. Also at the session, the Swiss Porini Foundation introduced the pilot project it is running in Switzerland with partners IUCN and Huawei. The project aims to improve accounting on carbon sinks in protected forest areas. The Porini Foundation has developed a forest carbon sequestration application based on cloud computing, blockchain, and high-precision satellite imagery to boost the transparency and traceability of forest carbon sink transactions and ensure the sustainable management and utilization of forest resources. The session concluded with a panel discussion covering how digital technology can enable green transformation in Europe, with TECH4ALL partners, academics, and representatives from industry organizations exploring the technological and strategic roadmap for achieving this aim. Conference attendees could also visit the TECH4ALL exhibition booth onsite to learn more about other TECH4ALL digital inclusion projects running in Europe. These include a world-first project of its type in Norway, which was deployed over 2021 and 2022 to save the nation's endangered wild Atlantic salmon from extinction. The solution uses camera tech coupled with an AI-powered gate system to identify the invasive Pacific salmon – an aggressive resource competitor and prolific spawner – and filter the invader into a holding tank, delivering an outcome that was previously impossible. Under the education domain of TECH4ALL, the France DigiTruck project was also on display, outlining the free training in digital skills offered to empower communities in need, notably unemployed young people and senior citizens.

Imagine a World Free of Plastic: Corona Cleans Up Beaches Around the World,"Corona creates a powerful global visual made from plastic diverted from our oceans LONDON, June 8, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today on World Oceans Day, Corona, an AB InBev global brand, brings its industry-leading net zero plastic footprint* standing to life with an arresting visual installation. The brand unveiled a written letter created from ocean bound plastic with the unifying message, ""Imagine a World Free of Plastic"" to illustrate the global scale of the ongoing environmental crisis. The plastic used in the exhibit is made from materials pulled from global beach clean-ups conducted by Corona and its partners. The installation calls attention to the 300 million tons of plastic that enter our oceans every year and make up over 80% of all marine debris.** (IUCN, 2021). The following markets recreated the Mexico plastic letter with ocean plastic from their local waterways/oceans: Brazil, Chile, Dominican Republic, Germany, Canary Islands, Italy and Puerto Rico. ""World Oceans Day is an opportunity to reflect and understand the human impact on vital natural resources. With Corona's long-standing history of protecting paradise, we needed to send an important message to the world,"" said Felipe Ambra, Global Corona Vice President. ""We created this plastic letter installation to highlight that it's time for action, not just words. We must act urgently to continue to protect our oceans from daily plastic pollution, and we hope this visual inspires others to reevaluate the role and impact they can have."" In addition to the plastic letter, Corona has made significant strides to combat marine plastic pollution in innovative new ways. For Global Recycling Day this year, Corona hosted the first ever Global Fishing Tournament in China, Brazil, Israel, South Africa, Colombia and Mexico that removed nearly 10 tons of plastic debris from the ocean and supported local fishing communities. In Germany, Corona created a clever returnable crate program that utilizes over 90% of recycled plastic to avoid producing virgin plastic. To date, Corona has conducted over 1,400 clean-ups, engaged over 68,000 volunteers, and collected plastic waste from more than 44 million square meters of beach. ""What's important to note is that the plastic we recovered is not local to Mexico. It's plastic that comes from all over the world and ends up on beaches everywhere through ocean currents,"" said Mercedes Guzman, founder of Lamerced, Corona's beach clean up and recycling partner for the Mexico plastic letter. ""Although our work in the field is very difficult, it's fulfilling to send the message that even though it's not my plastic, it's my shared world to protect."" With the plastic beach letter, Corona continues to support its industry-leading position as the first global beverage brand to achieve a net-zero plastic footprint in 2021. This initiative is part of the brand's ongoing efforts to recover more plastic from the environment than it releases.

IUCN and Huawei call for greater technology adoption to protect nature,"Echoing the ""Only One Earth"" theme of World Environment Day on June 5, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Huawei, and global partners explored the role of technology in nature conservation at the Tech for a Better Planet summit. SHENZHEN, China, June 7, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Huawei, and conservation project partners came together today to call for an increased global drive to develop and deploy new technologies to better protect the Earth. The two partners hosted the ""Tech for a Better Planet"" online summit to demonstrate how technology can vastly improve nature conservation outcomes, unveiling new digital technologies that are set to become crucial enablers of environmental protection. The process of responding to environmental threats has increased awareness that technology can make a pivotal difference in nature conservation. ""We believe that digital technology is a key enabler of environmental protection,"" said Tao Jingwen, Director of the Board and Director of the Corporate Sustainable Development Committee for Huawei. ""All sectors of society should work together within an open and collaborative market environment to apply technological innovations to industries and transform new technologies into solutions and services that can help build a green planet."" Huawei promotes green development in industries through ICT innovations that support the global zero-carbon journey. On the energy supply side, the company has integrated power electronics and digital technologies to accelerate the development of renewable energy. In terms of energy use, Huawei will continue to innovate energy-saving technologies to continuously improve the energy efficiency of ICT infrastructure, in turn saving energy and reducing emissions in industries. Huawei has also formed long-term partnerships to improve nature conservation outcomes by developing technology solutions that can better understand nature and result in more effective measures for protecting biodiversity in a range of ecosystems. In 2020, IUCN and Huawei launched the global Tech4Nature project and have since initiated pilot projects based on IUCN Green List Standard in Switzerland, Spain, China, Mexico, and Mauritius. Off the coast of Mauritius, IUCN, Huawei, and Ecomode Society deployed the first underwater system in the Western Indian Ocean that can monitor coral reef ecosystems in real time. The aim of the project is to restore highly threatened coral reef ecosystems by growing live coral in nurseries, transplanting them, and monitoring growth, water conditions, and threats like algae. The solution comprises underwater cameras with special lenses, sensors, a 4G network to carry data, and AI to interpret the findings. To date, nearly 10,000 coral fragments have been transplanted to degraded reefs, with a total of 25,000 planned for the end of 2022. ""The IUCN-Huawei partnership Tech4Nature project is a good example of an innovative project between the conservation and ICT sectors to realize the transformative potential of the appropriate use of digital technology for area-based nature conservation impact."" said Stewart Maginnis, Deputy Director General - Programme, IUCN. IUCN positions the combination of ""Technology, Data, and Innovation"" as central to achieving the ambitious goals of the IUCN Nature 2030 Programme. The organization also believes that innovations in data sensing, big data, machine learning, and AI can significantly improve knowledge and insights into impact areas such as land, water, oceans, and climate. In turn, this will help stakeholders design better informed conservation actions and monitoring systems for species and ecosystems. Also at the summit, experts and conservationists from the environmental and science sectors, including Ecomode Society, WWF Italy, Berlevåg jeger og fiskeforening, Shan Shui Nature Conservation Center, and Huawei Digital Energy Product Line, shared their insights and global practices on climate change and the conservation of natural resources.

'Money Game' first Korean webtoon adapted for US reality show,"Thriller webtoon “Money Game” has become the first Korean webtoon to be made into a web-based entertainment show in the US. Though a local adaptation of the webtoon series was made last year on Korean YouTube channel Jin Yong-jin, this is the first time a Korean webtoon’s IP is being adapted by foreign creators, production team and cast, according to Naver Webtoon. The five-part reality show on YouTube channel Jubilee features eight participants who are kept in separate cells in a facility for 10 days, seeking to win the maximum amount of prize money. The players will share a pool of $300,000 and aim to keep all the money during the 10-day survival. Helmed by director Mark Arbitrario, who was behind the TV series “Survivor” (2007) and “The Voice” (2014), “Money Game” makes for a compelling show as the participants have diverse racial and religious backgrounds and are from all walks of life.

AKMU helps to take leap through new collaboration album,"Sibling duo AKMU is ready to take the music scene by storm. The duet is opening a new chapter in their music career with new collaboration album “Next Episode,” releasing Monday evening. The seven-song package provides support and comfort to people when they hit rock bottom in their lives, brother and songwriter Lee Chan-hyuk and sister Lee Su-Hyun said during an online press conference. Fronted by lead track “Fall,” featuring singer and actress IU, the latest print for the group is a collaboration album brimming with the voices of A-listers, including veteran singer Lee Sun-hee, rapper Beenzino, Crush, Sam Kim, Zion.T and Choi Jung-hoon of indie rock band Jannabi, and is the first of its kind. It took years for the duo to team up with IU, making a dream come true for fans who had yearned for such a collaboration between the two. Su-hyun said she came together with the singer-songwriter because AKMU was looking for an artist who could “efficiently deliver the message of ‘Fall’ to the public” and that IU was a perfect match to the song. “She is popular and able to persuade anyone,” Su-hyun said, adding their work with IU became the start of the whole collaboration album. The sister-brother tandem said their main song was inspired by the movie “The Greatest Showman.” Chan-hyuk added that the word “fall” could be interpreted as a dark term, but he aims to send out positivity. “The song sends a positive message of inclusion, just like the film. We wanted to convey a hopeful message that ‘however deep down you fall, if you’re beside me holding my hand, nothing will matter,” Chan-hyuk said. Speaking about the music video to be released later, Chan-hyuk talked about how he falls endlessly. “If you get to see the clip, I continuously tumble down until the point where I hold Su-hyun’s hands. There’s a little tweak in this part. The screen is flipped upside down at this point to make it seem as if we’re soaring up in the sky, rather than falling.” He added that those who grasp the message of the song would be able to picture the duality of this particular scene. Chan-hyuk said the star-studded album centers around one common idea -- transcendent freedom, a term newly coined by the two. If their 2019 album’s “Freedom” explains freedom by “wanting to walk without clothes,” the pair tried to show a more buoyant mood in the latest album. The singer described the meaning behind transcendent freedom as an “extraordinary power that goes beyond people’s physical limits, allowing people to unplug from any external influence.” Chan-hyuk added that he aims to bring out a message not to be swayed even if one descends. When asked about what they wish to achieve through “Next Episode,” the chart-topping duo said they had set their hearts set on offering succor to those who are ready to make a leap of faith. “I started my music journey with the bold ambition to change the world with our music. But I realized that changing everyone is not the destination we are heading to,” Chan-hyuk said. He believes that the beauty of the world lies in diversity and wishes to encourage those set for a new change. From releasing an album with all jointly recorded songs to listing his name as a co-composer for Chan-hyuk, the duo also said they made several leaps of faith through the collaboration album. “It was the first time producing an album filled with other singers,” the two said together. The pair likened teaming up with seven artists to the Avengers, adding that they are beyond grateful to pair up their voices with the nation’s leading singers. A special space allowing music lovers to delve into transcendental freedom will also be available at Beaker’s flagship store in Yongsan, central Seoul, starting Tuesday until Aug. 8. The relaxing yet heartening seven-track collaboration album is set to release at 6 p.m.",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2660366,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2021/07/26/20210726000701_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,Korea Herald,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.,2021-07-26,iu,Social,IU Collaborates on AKMU's New Album,"""IU Shines Bright on AKMU's New Album""",2,"IU is a key figure in the collaboration album ""Next Episode"" and her involvement affects the story, as she features on the lead track ""Fall"" and provides a message that the siblings, Lee Chan-hyuk and Lee Su-Hyun, aimed to deliver to the public.",General category assigned after detailed analysis of Level 2 involvement,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.

Spotify begins service in Korea without IU’s songs,"The world’s largest music streaming platform Spotify on Tuesday announced the official launch of its service in Korea. “We’re looking forward to working even closer with the entire Korean music industry to uncover more artists and connect them with fans in Korea and the world, while also continuously working on providing an ever-improving, unrivaled listening experience to Korean listeners,” Alex Norstrom, Spotify’s chief freemium business officer, said in a statement. Korean users have access to over 60 million tracks and 4 billion playlists, the global audio streaming subscription service said. Spotify also emphasized that it aims to capture the local market with playlists specifically tailored for South Korean users, as well as its high-quality recommendation engine. Currently, the global streaming platform provides two different kinds of subscription options in Korea -- Premium Individual that costs 10,900 won ($9.80) a month and Premium Duo that costs 16,350 won a month, exclusive of taxes. With the premium service, subscribers can access music streaming with high sound quality, play downloaded music without an internet connection and enjoy music with no ad interruptions. Premium Duo is a two-person plan that offers two separate Spotify Premium accounts on one bill. Listeners in Korea can try out Spotify’s premium service free for seven days on their mobile phones without providing any credit card information. Those who provide their credit card information can enjoy premium services for three months free of charge. These free trials will be available through the end of June. Meanwhile, local music industry insiders have downplayed Spotify’s possible impact on the highly competitive Korean market. It has yet to sign deals to provide Korean music tracks from local music distribution giants like Kakao M, which owns tracks of popular singers such as IU, Zico and Monsta X. Many industry insiders are also curious as to why Spotify decided to launch without Kakao M. Spotify had announced on Dec. 18 that it would launch its service in Korea sometime in the first half of 2021. “We are still talking with Spotify (about distributing our songs through their platform),” a Kakao M spokesperson told The Korea Herald on Tuesday. Kakao M runs Korea’s largest music streaming platform Melon, which enjoys a 37.5 percent local market share. Korean platforms Genie and Flo follow in market share and the three platforms together account for more than 80 percent of the market here. The lack of Korean artists’ tracks has been considered one of the main obstacles that global audio streaming companies, such as Apple Music, face in seeking to expand in the Korean market, according to music industry sources. Apple Music, which entered the Korean market in 2016, struck deals with three entertainment companies -- SM Entertainment, JYP Entertainment and YG Entertainment -- for their artists’ music tracks. However, it also failed to sign on Kakao M. Meanwhile, Spotify on Tuesday named David Park as its managing director for Korea. “Our team on the ground has been working closely with local artists, labels and cultural tastemakers to offer an unrivaled music listening and discovery experience, ensuring that Spotify is going to be loved by listeners and artists in Korea,” Park said in a statement. Before joining Spotify, Park worked as the general manager at UberEats Korea, leading its diversification and expansion here. After graduating Korea University in 2003 with a degree in communications and journalism, he also worked for multiple content creation firms, including YouTube Korea and CJ Entertainment.

"[Digital Simplicity] IU, 8K display and next-generation gaming","Last Saturday, singer IU’s newest live performance video was revealed on YouTube. It was a landmark event since the video was formatted in 8K resolution, which easily outperforms 4K display. A small number of those who purchased the prohibitively expensive and visually expansive 88-inch OLED TV from LG Electronics were lucky enough to get a glimpse of what the 8K technology could offer, thanks to the stunning image featuring IU’s equally exquisite live performance. Just in case you have no idea who IU is, let me introduce her a bit. IU (whose name is Lee Ji-eun) is a top singer-songwriter and actress and has a huge fan base here -- so much so that a lot of Korean music fans helplessly stick to home-grown streaming music services largely because Apple Music, apparently due to copyright and contract issues, does not provide her music in the Korean market. The 8K video uploaded on YouTube, in which IU belted out her hit song “You & I” on “You Heeyeol’s Sketchbook” music program, garnered more than 500,000 views, and is now deemed as a reference to check whether your 8K display works properly. I watched the video with a new 4K computer monitor I bought recently. It was immensely impressive, even on 4K display. When I raised the resolution setting from 4K to 8K (fully aware that my screen is not designed to support 8K) on YouTube, the screen froze. It seems that my computer system, even with high-end options, found it hard to handle the enormous amount of digital data needed to stream 8K video. What should be noted is that KBS, a state-run TV station which aired the special program, recorded IU’s performance in 8K resolution but opted for YouTube to distribute the showcase piece. Under the current TV infrastructure, local TV stations are ill-equipped to broadcast 8K video seamlessly. I reckon that this is why KBS decided to let those who have 8K TVs and top-end desktop computers check out the eye-popping quality of the video through YouTube. For 8K TV makers such as LG Electronics and Samsung Electronics, IU’s live performance video is a blessing. Thanks to the high-profile video whose view count is likely to go up on the strength of IU’s popularity, TV makers can expect that the next-generation TV would be more readily accepted in the market, accelerating the shift from 4K to 8K. A similar technological shift is underway in the gaming industry. Both Microsoft and Sony are now getting ready to launch their next-generation video consoles later this year, promising better graphics and performance. The new machines support 4K video at 128 frames per second, a clear upgrade from today’s mainstream gaming systems. Microsoft, in particular, pins high hopes on Xbox Game Pass, a video game subscription service, which is “Netflix for video games.” Many Korean gamers at major online communities are talking about whether such subscription services could succeed, especially after Microsoft surprised the market this week by acquiring renowned US-based game developer Bethesda for $7.5 billion. Some users are considering PC-based gameplay after buying a Xbox Game Pass, while bypassing the purchase of the new console. The reason is the much-awaited debut of next-generation graphics cards, namely Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3080 and 3090 series. On Wednesday, two US tech YouTubers -- Marques Brownlee and Linus Sebastian -- rolled out videos introducing the sizzling appeal of 8K gaming powered by RTX 3090 graphics cards. Both videos were based on LG’s 88-inch OLED TV, whose retail price in Korea is set at more than 44 million won (about $37,000). To enjoy watching IU’s live performance in 8K format on a big screen, you would have to spend a lot of money upgrading your desktop computer system. The full-fledged 8K video, whether it’s a live performance on YouTube or gaming, requires the latest CPU, graphics card, TV set and other related components for a powerful desktop PC. Is it worth it? If you watch IU’s performance in 4K or lower resolution and find it good enough, a pricey upgrade to the 8K computer system could be premature. After all, 8K technology will eventually replace 4K in the coming years. Until then, many IU fans will likely feel that their smartphone screen is big enough as long as they can watch her impeccable performance.

Drawing the fine line: Artistic expression and offensive content,"Following widespread controversy over violent and sexually explicit content in his work, Naver webtoon “Hellper” author Sakk apologized Monday and said he was taking a break. It was the 248th episode of the webtoon’s second season. While controversy over “Hellper” began brewing as soon as the new season kicked off in 2016, things came to a head Sept. 11 when the local media picked up comments that had appeared on an online community site a few days earlier. The webtoon had gone too far in the latest episode, readers said. The scene that ignited the protests showed the much-loved grandmother character Pibada being tortured, stripped and injected with drugs. Although “Hellper” is restricted to readers 18 and older, many readers had expressed discomfort with its content. “Even we men think there is a definite problem when such a sexist webtoon is shown weekly without any regulations on mega platform Naver, just because there is an age restriction of 18 or above,” wrote one reader. The scene showing Pibada in distress brought out readers’ discomfort with other content in “Hellper.” The sexual objectification of women has been a consistent theme of the second season. Criminal acts such as rape, spycam filming, prostitution and sex with minors have been shown multiple times. Characters that blatantly reference celebrities such as IU, RM of BTS and Song Min-ho of Winner are shown performing indecent acts or being beaten to a pulp. “It is true that I expressed myself more freely after (the webtoon was) labelled adult content than when it was for a general audience,” said Saak. “Although Naver Webtoon officials warned me to keep the level of violence and sexual material in check so as to not disturb readers, despite it being adult content, I always went a bit beyond their guidelines because of my greed as an author.” But while Saak said he made a mistake, he insisted that the violation of Pidaba was essential to the plot and that the ultimate message of the comic is that good triumphs over evil. The only thing to blame was his lack of skill in presenting the material. “As someone who loves comics, I always thought the level of regulation for expression in comics is harsher than that for other kinds of content. So I thought to push the boundaries of expression a little,” said Saak in Monday’s announcement. “I feel that I have done the reverse and want to apologize to all those readers who love webtoons as well as other authors and fans who want to enjoy more diverse comic content.” Naver also apologized in the same announcement. “We will keep a closer eye on expressions of sensitive content and try to communicate more closely with authors,” a Naver Webtoon official said. This is the second time since last month that Naver has pledged to monitor authors’ work. The first concerned an innuendo-laden scene in author Kian84’s work. At the time, Kian84 admitted that his attempt at satire was over the line and he revised the scenes in question. Saak has also revised his controversial scenes. With few legal grounds to regulate contentious material in webtoons, it is up to authors and platforms to self-regulate.

LG U+ develops SIM-less tech for smart devices,"LG U+ announced Tuesday that the company and its global partners had developed a new technology enabling smart devices to work without SIM cards. Joining LG U+ in the development of the universal integrated circuit card, or iUICC, were cellular chipset developer Sony Semiconductor Israel, local communication module maker NTmore and German digital security solutions provider Giesecke+Devrient. SIM cards are responsible for storing users’ personal information, which is needed to identify the users’ plans and services. The iUICC replaces a SIM by putting the information on a communication chipset that powers voice and data connections. The technology will thus allow manufacturers to make smart devices smaller as they do not need to leave space for a SIM card, LG+ said. LG U+ said it plans to use the technology for other Internet of Things products, including tracking devices. The company added that it would introduce a series of IoT solutions using the SIM-less technology, as well as its own 5G network.

Tougher regulations eyed to stop S. Korean boats' illegal fishing overseas,"South Korea said Monday it will revamp its regulations to prevent possible illegal fishing activities by South Korean-flagged boats operating overseas, after the country had been on the verge of being labeled as one of the nations engaging in unregulated fishing. Previously, inspections had been carried out for illegal fishing activities only on foreign-flagged boats arriving in South Korea. The new measure will be implemented on the first batch of 12 deep-sea squid fishing boats in July, according to the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. In September 2019, the US made a preliminary decision to name South Korea as a country that engages in illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, after a South Korean boat was caught doing unauthorized fishing near the Antarctic. The decision was later lifted in January, but South Korea has been making efforts to bolster its control over illegal fishing activities to prevent similar incidents from recurring. The European Union made a similar decision on South Korea in 2013, which was lifted in 2015. Local authorities plan to especially beef up surveillance on poaching of banned marine creatures, such as sharks and whales, by South Korean boats. The ministry said it will also hand out official maps of the exclusive economic zones for fishing boats to prevent potential conflicts on waters. For fishing boats without an authorized fisheries observer on board, the ministry plans to monitor their activities through video surveillance systems.

IU drops collaboration single with BTS’ Suga,"Ready to reign K-pop charts, IU’s new single “Eight,” featuring Suga of BTS, was released Wednesday evening. The much-anticipated song has been co-written and composed by the singer-songwriter and the BTS member, who’s not only served as a producer but also lent his vocal for the track. Its title refers to the age of the two musicians, as both are 28 (Korean age). “As musicians of the same age, the two singers could relate to one another and create their own unique synergy in the song,” said IU’s agency EDAM Entertainment in a released statement. “Eight” follows IU’s 2019 EP “Love Poem.” The uplifting song, which flourishes on nostalgic pop-rock band sound, blends IU’s soaring vocal with Suga’s soothing rapping. IU explained that the self-reflective song continues the legacy of her age-themed songs such as “Twenty-three” and “Palette.” ""If the previous songs used to take a form of an ‘essay’ through which I directly talked to listeners, ‘Eight’ is like a short novel that confesses my life as a 28-years-old by using a virtual figure and various metaphors,” wrote the singer in an introduction for “Eight.” “While I’m not sure whether it’s from my personal emotion or from the overall social atmosphere coming from the disaster, my 28 would be remembered by the recurring feeling of lethargy and longing for the ‘orange island’ where we felt freedom rather than sadness.” Part of the song’s lyric reads, “Under the orange sun we dance together without shadows / There’s no such thing as a decided goodbye / Let’s meet on that beautiful memory.” In a lead up to the song’s release, Suga also shared on his broadcast channel that the production process with IU has been very smooth, saying, “There wasn’t a lot of back-and-forth. Shortly after I sent the (song’s) beats to her, she sent it back with the melody.” He also added that he’s been listening to the song quite often after finishing working on it, while he rarely listens to the songs he’s worked on after they are completed. The musicians have pretty much kept the song in mystery, raising K-pop listeners’ expectations over the last few days. They’ve only released few teaser contents, including a cryptic teaser video featuring IU in a futuristic setting. The song’s accompanying music video switches between an animation and scenes featuring IU, where she walks into a futuristic room and puts herself into a trance to travel various phases of her life. One of the most popular singer-actors, IU has scored multiple chart-toppers throughout her over a decade-long career, carving out her own niche in the small-screen as well. Most recently, she dropped “Give You My Heart” for the soundtrack of Korean hit drama “Crash Landing On You.” This is not the first time that Suga, whose stage name is Agust D, has proved his producing prowess.

"""인간이 부추긴 대멸종시대…신종 바이러스도 활개""","수렵, 농경, 도시 건설 등 생물다양성을 해치는 인간 활동 때문에 신종 코로나바이러스 감염증(코로나19)과 같은 인수공통감염병의 위험이 커졌다는 연구 결과가 나왔다. 지구가 6차 대멸종기에 돌입했다는 평가가 나올 정도의 자원 착취 속에서 인간과 서식지를 잃은 야생동물의 접촉이 늘어남에 따라 '괴질'이 인간사회에 창궐할 보건 위험이 커졌다는 진단이다. 7일(현지시간) 영국 가디언에 따르면 호주, 미국 연구진은 코로나19 팬데믹(세계적 대유행)도 이러한 현상의 일부라는 내용을 담은 논문을 영국 생물학 학술지 왕립학회보B에 게재했다. 연구진은 짐승들이 인간에게 옮긴 것으로 알려진 바이러스 142종을 골라 세계자연보전연맹(IUCN)의 멸종위기 보고서인 '적색목록'과 비교해 어떤 동물이 인간과 얼마만큼 바이러스를 공유하는지 집계했다. 그 결과 예상대로 소, 양, 개, 염소 등 가축들이 가장 많은 종류의 바이러스를 인간과 공유했고 그 수치는 야생 포유류의 8배에 달했다. 설치류, 박쥐류, 영장류 등 주택, 농장 근처에서 인간과 더불어 살아가는 동물들도 조사대상 가운데 75% 정도에 달하는 바이러스의 숙주인 것으로 나타났다. 박쥐류는 단독으로 사스(SARS·중증급성호흡기증후군), 니파, 마르부르크, 에볼라 등 질병과 관련된 것으로 조사됐다. 연구진은 인간에게 새로 전이되는 바이러스에 노출될 위험은 수렵, 야생동물 거래, 서식지 파괴 때문에 개체수가 감소한 멸종위기 야생동물들에서 가장 크다고 평가했다. 연구진은 생물다양성이 높은 오지에 인간이 침입해 인간이나 주변 동물과 야생동물의 새로운 접촉이 이뤄지면서 신종 바이러스 감염증이 인간에게 전이될 위험이 증가한다는 결론을 내렸다. 이번 논문의 주저자인 원헬스 연구소의 크리스틴 크뤼더 존슨은 ""바이러스가 동물로부터 인간에게 전이되는 것은 야생동물, 그들의 서식처와 관련한 인간활동의 직접적 결과""라고 지적했다. 존슨은 ""그런 활동 때문에 인간이 야생동물들과 바이러스를 공유하는 대가를 치른다""며 ""생물종의 생존과 바이러스 전파 위험이 동시에 커지고 여러 요소가 결합해 현재와 같은 혼란(코로나19 사태)이 닥치는 것'이라고 설명했다. 이날 논문과는 별개로 코로나19 창궐을 계기로 야생동물 생존권 문제가 인간의 보건 문제와 직결된다는 인식은 점점 공감대를 넓혀가고 있다. 세계 야생동물단체 200여곳은 이날 세계보건기구(WHO)에 서한을 보내 살아있는 야생동물을 사고파는 시장, 야생동물을 전통 약재로 쓰는 행위를 금지하도록 각국에 권고하라고 촉구했다. 이번 서한 발송에는 국제동물애호기금(IFAW), 런던동물원, 동물의 윤리적인 대우를 바라는 사람들(PETA) 등이 참여했다. 이들 단체는 전 세계에서 연간 20억명이 넘는 사람이 에볼라, 메르스(중동호흡기증후군), 인간면역결핍바이러스(HIV) 감염증, 소결핵증, 광견병, 렙토스피라증 등 짐승이 옮기는 질병에 걸리고 그 가운데 200만명이 넘는 이들이 숨진다고 강조했다. 특히 이들은 이번 코로나19 팬데믹도 중국 야생동물 시장(중국 후베이성 우한의 화난 수산시장)에서 시작된 것으로 보인다며 사람과 야생동물이 가까이 다가간 결과로 인간이 짐승의 병을 옮았다고 주장했다.

Pangolin identified as potential link for coronavirus spread,"BEIJING (AFP) -- The endangered pangolin may be the link that facilitated the spread of the novel coronavirus across China, Chinese scientists said Friday. Researchers have long suspected that the virus, which has now killed more than 630 people and infected some 31,000, was passed from an animal to a human at a market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. Researchers at the South China Agricultural University have identified the scaly mammal as a “potential intermediate host,” the university said in a statement, without providing further details. The new virus is believed to have originated in bats, but researchers have suggested there could have been an “intermediate host” in the transmission to humans. After testing more than 1,000 samples from wild animals, scientists from the university found the genome sequences of viruses found on pangolins to be 99 percent identical to those on coronavirus patients, the official Xinhua news agency reported. The pangolin is considered the most trafficked animal on the planet and more than one million have been snatched from Asian and African forests in the past decade, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). They are destined for markets in China and Vietnam, where their scales are used in traditional medicine -- despite having no medical benefits -- and their meat is bought on the black market. Shadowy wildlife trade Experts on Friday called for the Chinese scientists to release more data from their research. Simply reporting the similarity between the genome sequences of viruses is “not sufficient,” said James Wood, a veterinary medicine professor at the University of Cambridge. Wood said the results could have been caused by “contamination from a highly infected environment.” “We would need to see all of the genetic data to get a feel for how related the human and pangolin viruses are,” Jonathan Bell, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said. China in January ordered a temporary ban on the trade in wild animals until the epidemic is under control. The country has long been accused by conservationists of tolerating a shadowy trade in endangered animals for food or as ingredients in traditional medicines. “If we want to do everything in our power to prevent deadly disease outbreaks such as coronavirus, then a permanent ban on wildlife trade, in China, and around the world, is the only solution,” said Neil D‘Cruze, global head of wildlife research at World Animal Protection. A price list that circulated on China’s internet for a business at the Wuhan market showed a menagerie of animals or animal-based products including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game -- 112 items in all. The SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus that killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in 2002-03 also has been traced to wild animals, with scientists saying it likely originated in bats, later reaching humans via civets. “Working to end the trade in wildlife can help to resolve some of the longer-term risks associated with animal reservoirs of zoonoses,” Wood said, referring to infectious diseases that can be passed between animals and humans.

S. Korea named illegal fishing country by US,"The United States made a preliminary decision on Thursday to designate South Korea as a country that engages in illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, calling on Asia's fourth-largest economy to adopt tougher regulations. In a biennial report to Congress, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it is identifying South Korea for ""failing to apply sufficient sanctions to deter its vessels from engaging in fishing activities that violate conservation and management measures adopted by"" the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. ""The Republic of Korea committed to amending its domestic law to ensure that appropriate mechanisms exist for taking appropriate corrective actions in future cases,"" it said. To address the matter, the office of the US Trade Representative said in a press release that it plans to seek environment consultations with Seoul under the environment chapter of the two countries' bilateral free trade agreement. The move came after two South Korean fishing boats failed to comply with regulations of the CCAMLR while operating near Antarctica in 2017, according to Seoul's oceans ministry. It marks the second time for South Korea to be designated as a preliminary IUU fishing country after the European Union made a similar decision in 2013, which was lifted in 2015. The two South Korean boats continued their operations even after the CCAMLR notified them of the closure of the fishing grounds. One of the boats, Hongjin 701, claimed that it did not receive the alert as it was blocked as spam, while the other, Southern Ocean, deliberately ignored the message. Hongjin 701 was later cleared of charges, and Southern Ocean received a suspension of indictment in 2018, only to receive an operation ban of 60 days. Both ships did not receive criminal punishments. South Korea has been applying tougher regulations on overseas fishing after being designated as an IUU country in 2013, fining violators 1 billion won ($823,000). NOAA raised a question over South Korea's lack of efforts to forfeit unlawfully-raised profits earned by the problematic boats in March. Responding to the US claim, the ocean ministry in Seoul said it plans to make legal grounds to confiscate any profits raised from illegal operations. South Korea also vowed to implement ""zero-tolerance"" polices on local fishing boats. Last month, the US acknowledged that South Korea has been making notable progress in improving its regulations, but the preliminary designation was inevitable, citing a ""matter of timing,"" the ministry official added. Last month, the US also agreed to lift the preliminary decision for South Korea, even before the publication of its next report in 2021, if the South Korean parliament passes a revised bill that would strengthen punishments for illegal fishing, according to the ministry. Currently, illegal fishing in distant waters is an offense that carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison or fines of between 1 billion won ($837,000) and up to five times the value of the marine products. In July, a ruling party lawmaker submitted a revised bill of the Distant Water Fisheries Development Act that would create a penalty clause for violators. The preliminary decision will have no direct impact on the local fishing industry for the time being, according to the ministry, which claimed that local fishing boats will still be allowed to maintain their operations without new restrictions. If South Korea is confirmed to be an IUU nation, however, the country will be banned from shipping fishery goods to the US.

"[Kundhavi Kadiresan] Go fish! -- But, please, do so legally","The people of South Korea love fish and both demand and consumption of fish are on the rise. On the one hand that’s good, because fish is high in protein and low in fat and that helps to feed a hungry world while providing livelihoods for hundreds of millions of people across the Asia-Pacific region. But this increase in demand has also created opportunities for criminals to make a profit. While most of the Asia-Pacific fishing fleets operate within the rules, some $5 billion worth of fish is caught either illegally, has not been reported or the fishing boats are operating in an unregulated environment -- referred to collectively as IUU. That’s bad news on a number of levels. While IUU fishing is a global problem, the situation is disproportionately worse here in our region because Asia and the Pacific produce 75 percent of the world’s seafood, and because IUU fishers target countries with poorly developed economies and regulations that are also home to some of the most vulnerable communities. Of course IUU fishing leads to overexploitation of fish stocks and has a devastating impact on biodiversity and habitat. But it also hits honest fishers and communities dependent upon them right in the pocket. That includes buyers, sellers and legitimate industrial operations. In fact, evidence is mounting that IUU fishing is often associated with other transnational crimes too, including the exploitation of migrant workers enduring slave-like conditions on fishing boats at sea. In short, IUU fishing is a widespread and persistent problem across the Asia-Pacific region and resolving it will require long-term and unified regional commitment. 　A good day’s catch -- reeling in bad guys 　The good news is that many countries have now recognized the need to take action on IUU and are doing so. Many, including South Korea, have signed up to the Port State Measures Agreement, a legally binding treaty that operates as a giant worldwide net that’s closing in around IUU fishers. Introduced by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization in 2009, the PSMA was the first international agreement to set minimum standards for countries to prevent IUU seafood products from entering ports. Now fully enforceable, it provides a regulatory framework for countries to refuse entry of vessels suspected of participating or facilitating IUU fishing activities and allows for enforced inspection of vessels if entry is granted. Once a fishing boat is identified as operating in contravention of the PSMA, the information can be shared with the maritime and fishing authorities of other countries -- making it that much more difficult for that particular boat and its captain to continue profiting from IUU fishing. The effectiveness of this instrument in the region is clear, with vessels being seized and prosecuted by countries that have acceded to the PSMA. Thailand and Indonesia are two such examples. So far, 19 countries and territories in the Asia-Pacific region have acceded to the PSMA and several more are in the process of doing so. The PSMA is complemented by other regional initiatives that are setting seafood traceability standards so that buyers of seafood from the Asia-Pacific region can be guaranteed that the product does not come from IUU fishing practices. Such guarantees are opening international markets for products from Asia and the Pacific. However, while real and rapid progress is being made in Asia and the Pacific to reduce illegal fishing, there is still much to be done to eliminate misreporting or nonreporting of catch. The rapid advancement of access to telecommunications in the Asia-Pacific region has provided an infrastructure for the adoption of digital tools for reporting of catch. The immediate challenge is to empower fishers to adopt this technology downstream. 　Boats on water, boots on ground 　Upstream, the region now has seven state-of-the-art fisheries and surveillance centers that utilize high-tech equipment to identify vessels suspected of engaging in IUU practices. The establishment of national centers in Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Thailand and the US, in conjunction with the regional surveillance center for the western Pacific in the Solomon Islands, has increased the capacity for cohesion and collaboration among Asia-Pacific neighbors to tackle IUU fishing. Further developing efficient and effective monitoring and surveillance technologies, rewarding honest fishers (including small-scale fishers) for accurately reporting all catch (through enhanced market access), and building capacity of port states to detect and prosecute IUU fishers are clear steps for eliminating IUU fishing. Accession by all Asia-Pacific countries to the PSMA will send a loud and clear message to those involved in, or considering, IUU fishing that we’re onto them. June 5 is International Day for the Fight against IUU Fishing, and it serves as a timely reminder of the tasks at hand. There has never been a better time for the countries of the Asia-Pacific region to expand their efforts to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. That time is now.

Harry and Meghan step out in matching skirts in Tonga,"Prince Harry and wife Meghan donned matching red and cream unisex skirts Friday as they wrapped up a four-day Pacific island trip in Tonga with a celebration of local crafts and culture. The emphasis has been on Meghan's fashion choices during her first international tour since marrying into the British royals last May, but Harry cut a dash with a tasselled skirt worn over the outside of his suit. Pregnant Meghan wore an identical garment high on the waist, covering her baby bump, as the pair toured a craft market in the island kingdom's capital Nuku'alofa. The traditional skirts are a status symbol worn during formal occasions by both men and women in Tonga. The warm welcome received by the royal couple during their travels in Tonga and Fiji this week continued, with local Iunisi Fotofili struggling to express her feelings at being in Meghan's presence. ""I'm very happy. Excited. I don't know if when I see them, I will cry, or be like... I just want to run to her and hug her."" Crowds turned out in their thousands in Fiji and Tonga, eclipsing the numbers seen on the first week of the couple's Oceania tour in Australia. American-born Meghan wore a green-and-white striped cotton dress by Australian designer Martin Grant to tour the markets and meet Prime Minister Akilisi Pohiva. She changed to a casual blue Veronica Beard shirt dress for a visit to an environmental project at Nuku'alofa's Tupou College. At a banquet hosted by Tonga's King Tupou VI and Queen Nanasipau'u on Thursday night, Harry said the island nation was ""a magical setting"". ""Coming to Tonga I feel very much as though I am coming to visit an extended family,"" he said, reading a message from his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II. ""It gives me great pleasure that my grandson and his wife are visiting the kingdom of Tonga,"" the Queen's message said. ""Our two families have enjoyed a deep and warm friendship over many years and I hope that our close relationship continues with the next generation."" After less than 24 hours in Tonga, they return to Australia later Friday for the final days of the Invictus Games, the Olympic style sporting event for wounded soldiers that Harry helped found. They will then end their marathon 16-day tour in New Zealand.

[PyeongChang 2018] Kim Yuna reigns supreme in Olympics commercials,"The former Olympic figure skater Kim Yuna is dominating Korea’s ad industry during the PyeongChang Winter Games. Kim is featured in Coca-Cola’s Olympics commercials alongside actor Park Bo-gum, as well as a host of other ads, reminding viewers of her solid standing as a top-notch model for big-time advertisers here. Widely dubbed “Queen Yuna” or “figure queen” in Korea, Kim reaped gold in the Vancouver Olympics in 2010 and a silver medal in 2014 Sochi. She is revered by many Koreans as a figure skating hero, even after retiring from her athletic career following the Sochi Olympics. Following her retirement, Kim has emerged as the darling of advertisers. According to All That Sports, Kim’s management agency, Kim is currently in advertising deals with 10 brands, including SK Telecom, KB Financial Group, It’s Skin and J. Estina. Kim is reportedly paid some 1 billion won ($930,000) or more per ad deal. Her income for 2017 is estimated at around 15 billion won. She is likely to see her income climb further this year, thanks to her prominent appearances at the Olympic opening ceremony, according to ad industry sources. Kim made a surprise appearance on figure skates during the opening ceremony, showing a brief, elegant performance on a small rink near the cauldron in front of millions of viewers worldwide. She then received the Olympic torch from two members of the Korean women’s joint hockey team, being the final bearer of the torch. “With her positive public image strengthened by her appearance at the lighting of the Olympic cauldron, it seems that she might receive more contract offers from advertisers,” said an official from one of Kim’s clientele. Kim has been ranked first on the brand reputation, according to the latest survey by a Korean brand research agency. Kim outsmarted other popular female singers IU and Hong Jin-young, who were ranked No. 2 and 3. According to the agency, consumers linked Kim with keywords such as “beautiful,” “doing well” and “like.” Thanks to the positive image, Kim remains a top sports celebrity. Kim also played a role in promoting PyeongChang so that the city could host the 2018 Winter Olympics.

[Album review] IU’s classics cover album lacks raw emotion,"IU “A Flower Bookmark #2” Loen Entertainment Attempting to recreate the magic of classics, this 24-year-old songstress seems to be bent on proving that she isn‘t just an idolized K-pop singer. With her latest offering “A Flower Bookmark #2,” IU aims to present herself as a thoughtful musician whose heart belongs to the bygone decades. Maybe it’s her signature breathy and light vocals, but the cover album doesn’t quite bear the weight and complicated emotions of the originals. IU flaunts her crystal clear voice in “Autumn Morning,” a 1991 folk tune by veteran singer Yang Hee-eun and guitarist Lee Byung-woo. But the song’s poetic lyrics are overshadowed by the singer’s overly sweet and soft voice. “Secret Garden,” a cover of Lee Sang-eun’s beloved song from 2003, suffers from the same problem. Lee‘s warm and mature voice delivers a message of encouragement, but the song’s power is diminished when delivered in IU‘s ear-tickling voice. “Last Night Story,” a remake of the 1988 hit by trio Sobangcha, is perhaps the most notable track from the EP. Instead of being a sugary fairy, IU experiments with rather deadpan and pouty vocals in the upbeat retro song, morphing into a late-night party girl who bemoans the previous night. One is glad to hear a song that fits the singer, finally making IU sound and look more her age. Other covers such as “Sleepless Rainy Night,” originally by Park Kwang-hyun in 1990 and made famous by Kim Gun-mo in 1992, and “Everyday With You” by ’80s icons Deulgukhwa, don’t sound that different from covers by other artists. And IU’s vocals, although flawless, are still too shallow for “Rapids,” a mournful poetic ballad by Jeong Mi-jo from 1972. The six cover songs that revisit the ‘60s to the early 2000s are well made and diverse, but IU may have been too ambitious in her bid to pay homage to the old classics she admires.

Kakao Games debuts mobile RPG ‘Onmyoji’ in Korea,"“Onmyoji,” the hit 3-D mobile role-playing game that swept the Chinese and Japanese markets last year, has officially arrived in South Korea via Kakao’s game publishing unit Kakao Games. Kakao Games on Tuesday launched “Onmyoji for Kakao,” the localized version of the hit Chinese mobile RPG, via the Google Play store and Apple App Store in Korea. Developed by Chinese game developer NetEase, “Onmyoji” is a turn-based mobile RPG that has racked up more than 2 million downloads worldwide. It is the most highly anticipated mobile title to be released by Kakao’s game publishing unit this year. In “Onmyoji,” a Japanese term for a sorcerer in the Heian period of Japan, players fight evil spirits and monsters by collecting and maneuvering various “shikigami,” or spirits that aid the sorcerer. For the Korean launch of “Onmyoji,” Kakao said it took great care to localize the game for Korean players, employing more than 40 Korean voice actors as well as designating popular Korean singer IU as its marketing model. “When we think of ghosts or spirits, we typically think of expelling them. However, ‘Onmyoji’ is a game that requires players to strategically maneuver spirits to their advantage, offering a new, interesting twist,” said Kakao Games CEO Namkoong Whon during a press conference in Seoul in June. “‘Onmyoji’ is a game that will satisfy not only those who are already fans of RPGs but also new players interested in checking out the mobile RPG genre. We hope to offer players top-notch services so that ‘Onmyoji’ can become a game enjoyed by many,” he added. Currently, NCSoft’s “Lineage M” and Netmarble Games’ “Lineage II: Revolution” are the two most profitable mobile games in Korea. Nexon’s “Dark Avenger 3” released last week is trailing in third place in terms of revenue, and is now is expected to compete head-to-head with Kakao’s “Onmyoji.” By Sohn Ji-young ()",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1406169,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2017/08/01/20170801000793_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,Korea Herald,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.,2017-08-01,iu,Social,"""IU to Promote 'Onmyoji' in Kakao Games Launch""","""IU shares sweet inspiration from Korean folklore in her upcoming music comeback""",2,"IU is a key figure in the marketing model of Kakao Games' new mobile RPG 'Onmyoji', indicating her indirect involvement and relevance to the event.",General category assigned after detailed analysis of Level 2 involvement,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.

Seoul makes bid to host 2021 World Forestry Congress,"The Korea Forest Service submitted a bid last week to host the 15th World Forestry Congress in Seoul, officials said. The WFC, also known as the “Olympics of Forestry District,” is the largest international conference where delegates discuss countermeasures for forest maintenance, management and economic problems by sharing knowledge and experience every six years. Being nominated as a host city would imply that the hosting country’s forestry service is globally recognized. The proposal was delivered to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and presented at the FAO Committee on Forestry, where 600 representatives from 120 countries gathered at the FAO headquarters in Rome, Italy, to go over global forest issues and discuss Sustainable Development Goals on the future forestry service from July 18 to 22. Seventeen Korean government delegates were sent there, including Korea Forest Service Minister Shin Won-sop. Minister Shin started the proposal with brief reasons why Seoul is the most suitable city for hosting the WFC in 2021. In a speech, he said that Korea has a successful history in reforestation after the Korean War and is “ready and able” to share its experience and technology to expand the vision for the future of forestry. Rah Seung-yun, a communications adviser for KFS and co-CEO of Oratio, continued the proposal with more detailed explanation on Seoul’s capability as a host city. She said that Korea has successfully launched many international conferences, such as the International Wildland Fire Conference and IUFRO World Congress. Thus, the country is capable of execute efficiently the organization of the WFC, based on its experience. “Current partnership between agencies like FAO and KFS will be bolstered and yield mutual benefits if the WFC is held in Korea,” Rah added during her speech. The KFS further highlighted what it means to hold the WFC in Asia-Pacific, “considering the desirability of regional rotation.” Since the first congress in 1926, the WFC has been held in Asia-Pacific only twice, and the last time was nearly 40 years ago in Indonesia. In reponse to a video shown when the proposal was delivered, many foreign delegates appeared impressed with Seoul’s innovative plan in transforming once barren land into lush, green forest, according to KFS officials. The officials said Korea has promoted various welfare programs that use restored forests, such as operating forests for healing and forest kindergartens, and fostering urban forests in major cities. “We are sharing those policies with countries including Canada, China and Indonesia through exchange and cooperation programs,” a KFS official said. In addition to the proposal, the KFS held a series of bilateral meetings with China, Paraguay and Chile to ask for support, and hosted “Night of Korea” to promote Seoul last Wednesday. The WFC host city will be announced in December at the FAO Council in Italy based on the proposals during the FAO Committee on Forestry.

Is the Korean digital music market pushing out artists?,"Dependence on platforms, charts hindering new songs from reaching listeners This is the second in a two-part series examining Korea’s digital music industry. – Ed. If it’s hard to name more than a few Korean artists who are currently active and not idol stars, K-pop ballad singers or TV discoveries, it’s not because they don’t exist. “There are only two genres in today’s Korean music,” said Shin Dae-chul, head of the Barun Music Cooperative, at a forum in Seoul. “Idol music, non-idol music. The rest is meaningless. ... (The current digital music system) has naturally pushed out consumers in their 40s and 50s, and musicians as well. They can’t work in this system.” Musical artists agree with this. “It’s definitely not a market that’s structured to be favorable for artists,” said the vocalist of an indie rock band, speaking to The Korea Herald on condition of anonymity. The singer said her band, as well as other bands she has spoken to, has had bad experiences with distributors and platforms that were taking artists for granted. “It would be really difficult to get someone on the phone to change incorrect information about us on the site, or to remove our songs altogether.” For a while, she said that her band even considered not distributing their songs in Korea at all. “We don’t even make that much off streaming,” she said, noting that music streaming platforms take 40 percent of the streaming revenue. “We said, we don’t need it, take the songs down.” But there are not many other options for indie artists to make an income, she said. She and industry insiders like Lee Youn-hyuk, head of secretariat at the Record Label Industry Association of Korea, said the way digital music is consumed in Korea is a root cause of why only certain artists can succeed in the digital music environment. “Most people consume music by listening to the top 100 songs on the charts, although that’s difficult to prove quantitatively because every music streaming service is different,” Lee told The Korea Herald in a telephone interview. “Since most people don’t look for songs outside of the top 100, the charts become very conservative. The same songs are consumed over and over again, making it hard for new songs to break in.” As of Thursday, five of the top 10 songs on the real-time charts from Melon, the largest digital music servic provider, are from one album -- IU’s “Chat-Shire,” which was released Oct. 23. Two other songs are from idol stars -- Taeyeon’s “I,” released Oct. 7, and f(x)’s “4 Walls,” released Oct. 27. One song is from a drama soundtrack, and the remaining two are from Lim Chang-jung and Zion.T, both of whom are known for their megahits with each new album. The reason for this pattern of consumption has a lot to do with price. Digital music platforms in Korea all offer unlimited streaming packages at about 6,000 won ($5.25) a month. It is only another 2,000 won to 3,000 won to add unlimited mobile downloads for music. At this price point, consumers do not feel the need to carefully curate their listening choices. “Labels will often talk about switching between distributors in order to gain an edge with platforms, either through playlist recommendations or special mentions,” said Lee. “But even that’s only for artists and labels that have a bit of pull. For new faces, it’s a nonstarter.” While acknowledging the difficulties presented by the current digital market situation, both the anonymous vocalist and Lee noted the artists could also do more on their end to improve the situation. “We write and produce all of our own music, meaning that we sign our own contracts for distribution,” said the vocalist. “That’s the only reason we know all these problems with distribution rights. Most artists don’t know about this kind of stuff.” Lee added that artists in Korea need to study up. “A lot of indie artists abroad do the promotional work themselves. They hire someone to do that for them only when they’ve reached a point in their music where both they and their label can make income together,” Lee said. “You can’t eliminate market economics from music, especially pop music.” “Artists have to know how their music will reach and be consumed by listeners. If they can’t figure it out themselves, they need to know how to find good partners that can help them,” he added.　 By Won Ho-jung ()",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/718437,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2015/10/29/20151029001605_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,Korea Herald,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.,2015-10-29,iu,Social,IU's Chart Dominance Reveals Digital Music Woes,"""IU's 'Chat-Shire' Debuts at Number One on Melon, Breaking Records with Fueled Fan Engagement.""",3,"IU is mentioned as part of the top 10 songs on Melon's real-time charts, which highlights the dominance of established artists and genres in the digital music market.",General category assigned after detailed analysis of Level 3 involvement,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.
Korea removed from EU illegal fishing list,"The European Union has removed South Korea from its preliminary list of illegal fishing countries, the Ministery of Oceans and Fisheries said Tuesday. “The ministry will thoroughly administer to ensure that illegal fishing activities do not cause any international distrust and concern again,” said Vice Minister Kim Young-suk. Korea was placed on a blacklist that names nations for illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, or IUU, in 2013 after the EU detected Korean vessels operating illegally in West African waters, particularly those off Sierra Leone. The EU pointed out that Korea lacked the efficient control, monitoring system and deterrent sanctions that were in place around illegal fishing. Curacao and Ghana were also put on the preliminary IUU state list for the same issues. To stamp out illegal fishing activities, Seoul government revised its law on deep-sea fishing twice in 2013 and January this year, which included raising the maximum fine for IUU fishing to three times the value of the catch from illegal fishing, according to the ministry. Korean fishing vessels now carry a tracking device known as a vessel monitoring system, which allows satellites to track their movements. Korean officials monitor VMS from a 24-hour monitoring center that opened in May 2014. In February, the United States, which had included Korea on its own list of IUU countries in 2013, also delisted Korea. Once a country is officially named an IUU state, the country’s fishery products may be barred from U.S. and European markets while their vessels are believed to be engaged in IUU fishing and may also be prohibited from making port calls in those regions.

2NE1 snags Billboard’s best K-pop album pick of 2014,"As the countdown to 2015 approaches, the assessment of the year’s best songs, albums and industry newcomers is in full swing. Rounding out the year, Billboard’s top picks of the 10 best K-pop albums of 2014 land the feisty K-pop icons of 2NE1 the crown. The ladies’ second full-length album, “Crush,” was praised for cleverly exploring hybrid genres including reggae and R&B and landed them at the No. 1 spot, beating out other much awaited K-pop heavy-weight comebacks such as Seo Taiji and Rain. The magazine referred to opening the album with its eponymous single, which is not the album’s lead track, as a sign that although the group’s sound is maturing, the ladies have not forgotten where they come from. “ ... opening the record with ‘Crush,’ with its bewitching Middle-Eastern vibe and aggressive attitude similar to their signature hit “I Am the Best” proved that the girls know where their roots lie and they’re happy to treat fans while still evolving as artists.” According to Billboard, “Crush” debuted at No. 61 on the Billboard 200, marking the highest chart position and biggest sales week for a K-pop album ever. The album was released on Feb. 27 and came nearly four years after the group’s first full-length album, “To Anyone.” In somewhat of a surprising twist, taking second place on Billboard’s stamp of the year’s best K-pop albums is a band that would not even be labeled as a K-pop act by locals. Popular indie band Nell beat out the likes of K-pop starlet IU for the No. 2 spot with the band’s latest sixth full album, “Newton’s Apple.” Coincidentally released on the exact same day as 2NE1’s album, the magazine referred to Nell’s record as the strongest Korean rock album of the year. “ ... ‘Newton’s Apple’ highlights Nell’s vocalist/chief composer Kim Jong Wan’s clever and honest songwriting skills. ... All the lyrics are wrapped in warm, lush arrangements and instrumentals that enchant the listener simply by themselves,” Billboard wrote. With IU and Seo Taiji taking the third and fourth spots, respectively, rounding out the rest of the Top 10 lists are HA:TFELT (known best as Yenny from the Wonder Girls), Taeyang of Big Bang, B.A.P., Epik High, CNBLUE and Rain’s “Rain Effect.” As for Billboard’s list of the year’s 20 best K-pop songs, Beast took the top spot with the boy band’s single, “Good Luck,” followed by Seo Taiji & IU’s “Sogyeokdong” and G-Dragon & Taeyang’s “Good Boy.” Of course, no Korean music chart would seem complete without one of cheekiest faces of K-pop. Despite his fading presence from the mainstream international spotlight this year, Psy has still managed to infiltrate the magazine’s year-end round-ups with the artist’s 2-year-old viral phenom single “Gangnam Style” being ranked at No. 14 of the year’s most streamed songs. Psy was also listed as the 15th most streamed artist of 2014, beating out global superstars Chris Brown, Eminem, One Direction and Maroon 5.

Sashimi trend pushing ...bluefin tuna to extinction,"SYDNEY (AFP) ― The Pacific bluefin tuna, a fish used in sushi and sashimi dishes, is at risk of extinction as the global food market places “unsustainable pressure” on the species and others, a conservation body warned. The bluefin tuna joined the Chinese pufferfish, American eel, Chinese cobra and Australian black grass-dart butterfly on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s “red list” of threatened species. The updated list was released by the IUCN at its once-a-decade World Parks Congress in Sydney as it called for better management of protected areas, where some of the decline in species levels has taken place. “Each update of the IUCN ‘red list’ makes us realize that our planet is constantly losing its incredible diversity of life, largely due to our destructive actions to satisfy our growing appetite for resources,” IUCN’s director-general Julia Marton-Lefevre said. “But we have scientific evidence that protected areas can play a central role in reversing this trend,” she added. For this year’s list, the IUCN assessed 76,199 species, with 22,413 judged to be under threat. The Pacific bluefin tuna moved from the “least concern” threat category to “vulnerable” as the species is threatened with extinction due to its use in Asia’s sushi and sashimi markets, the Swiss-based group said. As most of the fish caught are juveniles that have not yet reproduced, the population has dropped by 19-33 percent over the past 22 years.

Asians eating anteaters to extinction: conservationists,"The scaly anteater, which looks like an artichoke with legs and a tail, is being eaten out of existence as its tasty meat is served up at banquets across Asia, conservationists said Tuesday. The mysterious mammal, also known as a pangolin, is the prey of poachers with more than 1 million believed to have been snatched from the wild in the past decade. “In the 21st century we really should not be eating species to extinction ― there is simply no excuse for allowing this illegal trade to continue,” said Jonathan Baillie, cochair of the pangolin specialist group of the IUCN Species Survival Commission. “All eight pangolin species are now listed as threatened with extinction, largely because they are being traded to China and Vietnam,” he said in an statement from the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The illegal trade is flourishing for, besides being a luxury food, pangolin scales are also used in Chinese medicine to treat conditions such as psoriasis and poor circulation. In fact, this scaly anteater has become the world’s most illegally traded mammal, which has led the IUCN to step up conservation efforts in Asia and also Africa where traders are turning to meet the growing demand. “A first vital step is for the Chinese and Vietnamese governments to conduct an inventory of their pangolin scale stocks and make this publicly available to prove that wild-caught pangolins are no longer supplying the commercial trade,” said Dan Challender, the other cochair of the specialist group based at the Zoological Society of London. Conservationists want to save the pangolin from the dinner table and the annals of extinction as they are highly evolutionarily distinct. Extinction would wipe out 80 million years of evolutionary history.

Emperor penguins waddling to extinction due to global warming,"PARIS (AFP) ― Global warming will send Antarctica’s emperor penguins into decline by 2100, scientists projected Sunday, and called for the emblematic birds to be listed as endangered and their habitat better protected. The world’s largest penguin species came to global fame with a 2005 documentary, “March of the Penguins,” portraying their annual trek across the icy wastes, and the 2006 cartoon movie “Happy Feet.” The new study sheds light on the birds’ reliance on sea ice for breeding and raising their young. The ice also protects their prey ― fish and krill ― by maintaining the food chain. Declining sea ice caused by climate change would place all 45 known emperor penguin colonies into decline by 2100, according to the population simulation. “At least two-thirds (of colonies) are projected to have declined by (more than) 50 percent from their current size” by the end of the century, said the paper published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Dynamics differ between colonies, but “the global population is projected to have declined by at least 19 percent,” after growing 10 percent up to 2048, it added. The team said colonies located between the eastern Wedell Sea and the western Indian Ocean will see the biggest declines, while those in the Ross Sea will be least affected. In fact, the Ross Sea penguin population will continue to grow until 2100, after which the trend will reverse. “Our results indicated that at least 75 percent of the emperor penguin colonies are at least vulnerable to future sea ice change, and 20 percent will probably be quasi-extinct by 2100,” the paper said. Given these findings, the emperor penguin “is fully deserving of endangered status due to climate change,” the team said ― referring to the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species. The bird is currently listed as “stable” by the IUCN’s species bible.",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3823533,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2014/06/30/20140630000359_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,Korea Herald,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.,2014-06-30,iu,Social,Iu Urges Conservation Action for Emperor Penguins,"IU's soothing voice has inspired many to take action against ocean pollution, a cause close to her heart as an advocate for marine conservation.",0,"The article does not mention IU directly, and there is no connection between IU and the topic of emperor penguins or global warming.",General category assigned after detailed analysis of Level 0 involvement,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.
[Lee Jae-min] A red card from Brussels?,"As the Europeans fumble for a red card, Korea is mounting all-out efforts to avoid it. All government agencies are being mobilized to talk the EU out of issuing a red card. The issue at hand is IUU (Illegal, Unreported or Unregulated) fishing, and the EU still seems skeptical of Korea’s plan to eradicate it. A yellow card was already handed to Korea in November last year when Brussels included Seoul on its preliminary list of IUU fishing countries along with Ghana and Curacao, a Dutch island in the West Indies. Brussels has been of the view that Korean fishing vessels have been engaged in IUU fishing activities while the Korean government has looked the other way. IUU fishing is an illegal fishing activity which is by far the worst type of human maritime behavior universally condemned by the global community. In FAO jargon, IUU is public enemy number one. The EU delegation’s visit to Korea in mid-June was to confirm if a red card should be issued to Korea for failure to respond to IUU fishing activities. A red card here would mean an import ban for Korean fisheries products and a port entry ban for Korean vessels, a significant blow to the Korean fisheries industry. Furthermore, the negative publicity would be immense: The country will be branded as a hub for destructive fishing. A final decision by the EU will be issued by September this year. Although largely unknown to the general public, 2013 was the year that set off an alarm for Korean distant water fisheries activities. In January 2013, the United States issued a list of 10 IUU fishing countries including Korea. The EU then followed in November by designating Korea, though preliminarily, as an IUU fishing country along with Ghana and Curacao. Among a dozen or so countries listed on the U.S. and EU lists, Korea is the only major fishing country. By all accounts, Korea’s name just stands out from the pack and cries for attention. As has been observed by domestic media on the occasion of the EU delegation’s visit ten days ago, the issue is not merely about the possibility of a reduction of exports as a result of an EU import ban. The real and long-lasting damage is the negative image to be imprinted from this final designation of IUU fishing. Few realize how damaging it is to carry the tag of an IUU fishing country. Some NGOs almost treat this activity as on par with modern-day piracy in that it extorts crucial maritime resources from developing countries. There is no question that IUU fishing is one of the major culprits of the global depletion of fish stocks. It is also absolutely unquestionable that global efforts to combat IUU fishing cannot be delayed any longer. Time is running out fast. Also, it is a pity that Korea has not done its homework since 2011 when this issue first surfaced. No one would dispute the fact that Seoul needs to take this issue seriously and find a way to enforce its laws effectively. That said, however, it begs a question why Korea is the only major fishing power that has been included on these IUU lists, while other major fishing countries are left out. This is difficult to reconcile with recently released reports that discuss IUU fishing activities of other major fishing countries as well. Merely canvassing anecdotal evidence of IUU fishing of a country followed by some unilateral sanction may not be sufficient to offer an accurate picture of the problem. Rather, a global scheme to detect and eradicate IUU fishing should be explored. In the meantime, watchers are holding their breath waiting for a final decision from the EU after the recent verification visit. Whatever decision the EU makes will also significantly affect that of the United States.

Scientists analyze genome of vulture for first time,"Korea scientists successfully analyzed the genome of the cinereous vulture, a large bird of prey found across Europe and Asia, for the first time, the Science Ministry said Monday. The findings are expected to offer clues on the genetic structure of the bird, scientifically known as Aegypius monachus, such as why it does not contract diseases from eating rotten meat. Scientists took blood samples from two live vultures and performed an analysis of the first whole genome and transcriptome of the birds by using Next Generation Sequencing ― a type of DNA decoder ― and bioinformatics technology. Bioinformatics involves using a computer to analyze and process huge amounts of biological data. Through five-month-long genome sequencing, researchers identified 200,000 unigenes, genome fragments that each has unique characteristics. They said these are “candidates” that could be identified as genes with further analysis. Scientists found that the bird’s genes related to immunity and gastric acid secretion were unusual compared to other animals. This can explain why the bird, both a hunter and a scavenger, is not affected by pathogenic bacteria after ingesting decayed meat. They also found that vultures became genetically separate from falcons about 80 million years ago. According to the researchers, the bird carries out a crucial ecological role by eating animal carcass. This prevents the bacteria from the dead bodies from infecting other animals or humans. But vulture populations have been decreasing due to the diminishing number of dead livestock, coupled with the increase in poisonous chemical substances that have been released into the wild. Researches said there have not been enough studies on the ecological role and biological uniqueness of the birds. “Genome analysis of the vulture will provide ground-breaking information toward research of the bird,” said project leader Paek Woo-ki of the National Science Museum, saying the study will be a milestone in efforts to preserve the vultures. The cinereous vulture is categorized as “near threatened,” according to “The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. In Korea, it is considered an endangered animal and is designated as a national monument. The research was conducted by the National Science Museum, the Cultural Heritage Administration, Theragenetex Bio Institute and the Korean Bioinformation Center of the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology.

SHINee snags ‘Artist of the Year’ at MelOn Music Awards,"Emotional Ailee accepts ‘Top 10’ prize, Psy wins ‘Global Artist’ award The 2013 MelOn Music Awards on Thursday recognized the biggest acts in Korean music including SHINee, Busker Busker and EXO, who walked away with “Artist of the Year,” “Album of the Year” and “Song of the Year,” respectively. The MelOn Music Awards are among the biggest in the country and hand out prizes based on digital sales and online votes. SHINee’s award marked the first time they were crowned artist of the year at the annual awards ceremony, beating out rival boy band Beast, who had taken home the prize the two previous years. The group recently released its 5th Mini Album titled “Everybody” last month. The EP went on to top all the local major weekly album charts as well as ranking at No. 2 on the U.S. Billboard World Albums chart. Busker Busker repeated past success by taking home this year’s “Album of the Year” award for the group’s eponymous second studio album. Busker Busker won best album at last year’s MelOn Music Awards for “Busker Busker 1st Album.” Soon after the group’s second album was released on Sept. 25, all of its nine tracks were ranked No.1-No.9 on most major online music services including Naver, Bugs, Melon and Mnet, with the title track “Love, At First” taking the top spot on all of the local real-time charts. The ceremony also awarded “Top 10” prizes to: EXO (also winning this year’s “Netizens Popularity Award”); Davichi; Dynamic Duo; Busker Busker; Beast; SHINee; Sistar; IU; Ailee; and G-Dragon. Solo singer Ailee was emotional upon receiving the award, unable to hold back tears on stage. The artist has recently been caught up in a controversy involving nude photos released on the Internet. Ailee’s agency made a statement claiming the nude photos were taken under false pretenses as the singer thought she was posing for an underwear modeling test shoot. Other winners of the night included hip-hop artist Yoon Mirae; legendary rock star Cho Yong-pil; Baechigi; Huh Gak; K.will;, f(x); Shin Seung-hoon; and Shinsadong Tiger for this year’s Songwriter Award. Rap star Psy was, to no surprise, awarded the “Global Artist” award while newcomers Kim Ye-rim and boy band BTS were honored with the “Rookie of the Year” trophy.

Eyelike: IU impresses on ‘Modern Times’,"IU impresses on ‘Modern Times’ IU “Modern Times” (LOEN Entertainment) IU, known for her “younger sister” image and songs, has shed her cutesy pop cocoon for a more mature look and sound. “Modern Times” has a total of 13 tracks with genres that range from pop, folk, jazz and swing to bossa nova and Latin. Title track “The Red Shoes” showcases IU’s vocals in a cabaret-style setting, complete with blaring horns and lively percussion. Like many of the tracks on the album, vintage sounds and modern effects are put together artfully, forming a fresh but familiar compilation of songs. “Modern Times” has a distinct carefree feel that is reminiscent of jazz during the Roaring Twenties. “Everyone has Secrets” features Brown Eyed Girls member Ga-in and is a bossa nova number that mixes the two singers’ voices well. “Walk with Me, Girl” features veteran singer Choi Baek-ho and provides an interesting traditional Korean-sounding vocal into the mix. “A Gloomy Clock” features SHINee’s Jong-hyun and is one of the most modern-sounding tracks in the whole album. The track provides listeners with an interesting array of bubbling, ticking, whistling and xylophone sounds, making for a playful song. By Cha Yo-rim (yorimcha@heraldcorp.com) Miley Cyrus‘s new album shows promise Miley Cyrus, “Bangerz” (RCA) Cyrus’ “Bangerz,” her fourth album, is a collection that marks the 20-year-old‘s musical breakthrough. The former “Hannah Montana” star kicks off the 13-track set with “Adore You,” a downbeat song about love. Other tracks that follow with that energy -- “Wrecking Ball,” “My Darlin” and “Somewhere Else” -- capture a more mature, nuanced side of Cyrus that we haven’t seen much of -- and that‘s a welcome change. When she explores the different emotions of her character and doesn’t play the caricature that she‘s become, you’re able to appreciate Cyrus as an artist. The Britney Spears-assisted “SMS (Bangerz)” and the Pharrell-produced “(hash)GETITRIGHT” are addictive, feel-good, up-tempo pop tunes; “FU” -- guess what it stands for -- has Cyrus semi-angry over a dramatic beat, and it makes for an overall punchy and amazing track; and “4x4,” featuring Nelly, is a pop-twang adventure. Even “Do My Thang” -- where Cyrus isn‘t too convincing as a rapper -- sounds good thanks to the groovy hook that she sings, and will.i.am’s Southern hip-hop-flavored beat. (AP) McCartney stays fresh, familiar on ‘New’ Paul McCartney “New” (Hear Music) For his 16th solo record, and first of original material in six years, Paul McCartney turned to a team of four hot producers to come up with something “New.” The result is both fresh and comfortably familiar. McCartney, a master of the catchy three-minute pop song, isn‘t reinventing himself here as the title may suggest. Just try listening to “On My Way to Work” or “Queenie Eye” without bobbing your head along to the beat. Really, love him or hate him, few can pump out these types of ditties quite like McCartney. Still, he’s no Bob Dylan. There are flirtations with material with some gravitas here, but it‘s just that -- a flirtation. Much of the credit for the success of “New” goes to McCartney’s four producers -- especially Paul Epworth (Adele) and Mark Ronson (Amy Winehouse). The other two, Giles Martin and Ethan Johns, are the sons of famous Beatles producers George Martin and Glyn Johns. While the multi-producer approach could have resulted in a hot mess, the end result is surprisingly cohesive, modern-sounding and, most of all, fun to listen to.

"Upo Wetlands full of life, history and beauty","UNESCO World Heritage candidate site shows raw nature In the far southern region of Changnyeong, South Gyeongsang Province, is a spread of wetlands ― Upo, one of the most visited natural sites in the country. In early morning, the wet fog on the wetland’s surface creates a misty and mysterious atmosphere, while during the day, the greens accentuate the primitive nature. At sunset, the sun smudges the sky and creates a spectacular scene ― if you are lucky you may observe troupes of migratory birds flying across the setting sun. At night, the insects and animals start to create noise, beautiful enough to sit back and listen to. It is a peaceful, serene yet dynamic end to the day. The Upo Wetlands have been on the UNESCO World Heritage Site Tentative List since 2011. The wetlands, composed of 2.3 square kilometers of main wetland and many smaller ones scattered around it, were previously inscribed on the Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance in 1998. Endangered species’ shelter More than 180 bird species can be seen in Upo, including at least 10 endangered species. Anas falcate and Anas formosa are included in the IUCN Red Data Book, according to UNESCO. Those observed in the area include Platalea leucorodia (first-class endangered species designated by the Korean government), Anser fabalis, Cygnus cygnus, Cygnus olor, Anas formosa, Falco subbuteo and Charadrius placidus (second-class endangered species). The Korean authorities instituted a special project in 2008 to restore the crested ibis, believed to have been extinct at the site. The birds have managed to spawn and breed thanks to the Chinese government, which sent a pair as a gift. The wetlands are also home to numerous plant species. Typha orientalis C. presl, acorus calamus L, reed, zizania latifolia, eleocharis kuroguwai ohwi, hornwort, arrowhead, and Euryale ferox salisb are just a few of the plants that contribute to the green, fresh, dynamic world of Upo. History Koreans did not appreciate the value of Upo until recently. Ancient Koreans took nature as it was and preserved it as such without labeling it or limiting its use for preservation. There are a few historical records of a stream and waters in the area, but their geography hardly matches the current Upo site. The name Upo appeared during the Japanese colonial period (1910-1945) and some residents still use the Joseon era (1392-1910) nicknames for the area such as Sobeol, Namubeol or Moraebeol. In 1918, a 50,000:1 scale map of Korea was issued for the first time, with the word Upo emerging for the first time as well. “Upo is the largest inland body of water in Korea aside from Cheonji, the caldera lake at the top of Mt. Baekdu,” the government recorded in another document. Upo was designated Natural Monument No. 15 in 1933 as part of a cultural preservation strategy. In 1962, more than a decade after liberation, the site was designated a South Korean Natural Monument for being the homeland of swans, but in 1973 the designation was withdrawn as the birds no longer came to the area. Preservation efforts Since the withdrawal of the Natural Monument designation, Upo has been at the center of controversy surrounding development which led to damage of its ecosystem. In 1997, aiming to restrict excessive fishing and collection of marsh snails, the government once again designated the area an Ecological Conservation Area, followed by the inscription on the Ramsar. “Since then, the government has purchased the surrounding lands of the area to put the ecosystem and other areas under tight monitoring,” the Upo Wetland Management Office said on its website. Future The local governments ― the offices of South Gyeongsang Province and Changnyeong County ― joined hands with local scholars in pushing the wetlands to be designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. “It is actually the best way to protect the natural site and its ecological system,” said Do Yuno, researcher at Pusan National University.

Hyundai unveils new Equus after four years,"Art Deco-inspired Rolls-Royce makes Asian debut in Seoul Rolls-Royce’s Art Deco-inspired Ghost (Rolls-Royce Motor Cars) Hyundai Motor and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars unveiled their most prestigious segment cars separately on Wednesday in Cheongdam-dong, a district strewn with luxury designers’ boutiques in southern Seoul. Hyundai, Korea’s largest carmaker, introduced the more luxurious version of its upscale sedan Equus, four years after the previous launch ahead of its official sale starting early December. Though there is no drastic change in exterior design, the chrome grille and LED headlamps have a more sophisticated styling, while the rear combination lamps were also newly designed to emphasize a serene, modern image. Special features like full-color head-up display, premium sound system supported by Harman International, digital transmission control, and retractable window shades made of glass are all integrated into basic options for the latest model. Hyundai Motor’s new Equus (Kim Myung-sub/The Korea Herald) The security system has also been enhanced to support the advanced-technology smart cruise control that starts or stops the car based on the car’s distance from the vehicle in front of it and the warning system for when the vehicle is within another’s blind spot. The carmaker did not unveil the retail price of the new model, citing the official launch schedule next month. “Based on product quality and reasonable price, the new Equus will secure a special competitiveness against import cars in the nation’s ultra-premium segment,” said a Hyundai official. On the same day, Rolls-Royce, the English manufacturer of ultra-luxury cars, launched a new Ghost saloon, one of the three exclusive models inspired by the Art Deco movement in the early 20th century, for the first time in Asia. Only 20 limited vehicles have been produced for the Art Deco Ghost edition and one of them was iunveiled to local press on the day. The retail price of the made-to-order premium sedan starts from 473 million won ($435,000). All the design details such as simplicity in form and sweeping lines reflect the artistic movement that stemmed from Paris. Wood frames used in the interior design are handmade by craftsmen. “Korea is one of the most important markets for us and still has a lot of potential for further growth in sales. That’s why we chose Korea for the Art Deco edition’s Asian debut,” Brenda Pek, Asia Pacific marketing head, told The Korea Herald. In Korea, some 20 Rolls-Royce vehicles are sold every year.

The show, the world's biggest dedicated to chocolate, brings together fashion designers and chocolatiers from around the world. (UPI) Actress Kim Yoo-jung walked the runway wearing a delicately decorated dress made of chocolate during a fashion show at the inauguration of the annual Salon du Chocolat in Paris on Tuesday. For the show, fashion designers and chocolatiers combined their creativity to design unique pieces of art including life-sized chocolate dresses such as a magnificently detailed milk chocolate robe that Kim wore for the closing stage. Stephane Bonnat, a chocolatier who created the dress in collaboration with designer Valerie Pache, said the hardest part of designing a dress made of chocolate was finding harmony between the texture of the chocolate and the movement of the dress. “Chocolate is supposed to be rigid and melt at the temperature of the body. We have some tricky things to do so the models are not stuck,” Bonnat said in an interview with Reuters.

Creations of the ‘beautiful mind’,"Sun R. Kim “Creations of the beautiful mind.” No, I am not referring to a novel I read last week. It refers to the definition of intellectual property offered by the World Intellectual Property Organization, or WIPO. “Intellectual property refers to creations of the mind: inventions, literary and artistic works, and symbols, names, images and designs used in commerce.” In the midst of the infamous “intergalactic” ongoing battle between Samsung and Apple, we tend to think that intellectual property is something complicated and extensive which we see only on news and TV. We may not be aware that a pair of cool basketball shoes your nephew wants for Christmas is armed with a bundle of intellectual property. We may not be aware that your favorite musical that you laughed and cried over last week with your mother or Psy’s “Gangnam Style” and its viral went video is “stylized” with a bundle of intellectual property. We may not be aware that the cold medicine which saved your last night’s sleep is a bundle of intellectual property. Intellectual property is closer to our daily lives than we think and these bundles of intellectual property are created by “the minds of people.” How timely and appropriate that such “minds of people” gather here in Seoul where “creations of the mind” are indeed abundant. The Seoul AIPPI 2012 43rd World Intellectual Property Congress is taking place from Saturday until Tuesday at COEX. Being the world’s oldest global intellectual property association dating back to 1897, the association combines the old tradition with the progressive spirit. And so does Seoul, a city embraced with the enigmatic combination of traditional spirit and progressive edginess. The congress program covers arrays of different current IP issues that stimulate our intellectual minds. The cultural evening program at the historic Bongeunsa temple will offer a peace of mind to participants regardless of their religious belief due to its serene surrounding. And the social networking opportunity offered to 2,000 participants of this conference will surely help the attendees to renew old friendship among colleagues and friends and bind new friendships among working colleagues. I hope that participants will leave this conference not only with sharpened minds along with new and renewed friendships but also with the beautiful mind behind such “creations of the mind.” And for the people who are generous to read my article I hope that they will have a moment to ponder that our daily lives are surrounded with beautiful creations of mind of people including the newspaper you are reading.

Jeju Gotjawal park offers eco-diversity,"Jeju Gotjawal Provincial Park (JDC) Jeju Gotjawal Provincial Park, slated to open next year, is offering a glimpse into its ecological repository in a bid to drum up domestic and international interest and garner support for its preservation. The Jeju Free International City Development Center said Tuesday the unfinished park would be open to the public for nine days from Sept. 7-15 while the IUCN World Conservation Congress is being held. It is inviting environmental leaders participating in the world’s largest environmental gathering to visit the area, it added. A motion, recognizing the ecological value of gotjawal and calling for its preservation, has been submitted to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the world’s largest environmental network which holds the congress every four years. Gotjawal, which refers to a forest founded on terrain formed by lava flows, covers 109.87 square kilometers, about 6 percent of Jeju Island. It is a source of underground water and home to a wide variety of plants and animals. For example, the Gotjawal area includes some of the Jeju Lava Tubes, which are a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Dong Baek Dong San (Camelia Forest) wetland, which is on the Ramsar Wetland list. In addition, Gotjawal provides a habitat for 36 species of endangered plants and birds. JDC, together with the Jeju provincial government and the Gotjawal Trust of Jeju, are spending 6.5 billion won ($5.8 million) to turn some 1.5 square kilometers of the gotjawal area in Seogwipo into a provincial park, with information centers and forest trails. According to JDC officials, forest trails are already complete and the first phase of the park development project is expected to be finished this December.

Ecuador seeks Korean support for unique habitat,"A former ambassador spearheading a unique Ecuadorian initiative to protect one of the most bio-diverse places on earth has asked Korea for its support. Speaking at the Ecuadorian Embassy in Seoul on Thursday, Yasuni-ITT Initiative Secretary of State Ivonne Baki expressed her hope that the Korean government and local concerns would support the Ecuadorian government’s proposal to refrain from exploiting oil reserves at Yasuni National Park by contributing to the cost of forgone oil revenues. The initiative proposes leaving reserves worth some $7.2 billion untouched if the international community donates half of the oil’s value. “We are here in because we believe Korea cares very much about the environment but, other than that, also because they care about the people and the future generations and present generations,” said Baki ahead of an appearance at the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Jeju. “We haven’t had any country from Asia (add its support) yet ... and I would like very much for Korea be the first one to do so.” Yasuni-ITT Initiative Secretary of State Ivonne Baki Supporters of the initiative say that leaving the area untouched will save some 1.2 billion metric tons in CO2 emissions, and protect its unique flora and fauna and two uncontacted indigenous tribes. Considered ecologically unique, the national park has more species of trees in one hectare than the entire of North America. “This is the place that has the highest biodiversity because of the geographical position is has,” said Baki. “It is just at the intersection of the equatorial line and Andreas Mountains and, because of that intersection and being a little higher in altitude than the rest of the Amazon, it has never been affected by climate change and that is why is has the highest biodiversity for flora and fauna.” Baki said that, despite much talk, the international community was doing little in the way of concrete action to tackle climate change and protect biodiversity. “Nobody is doing it, and it is about doing it altogether. Especially the developed countries, they are the ones that are contaminating, not the developing countries. But Ecuador took this very ― I call it courageous ― decision to leave Yasuni National Park intact.” The proposal, which has attracted the support of Leonardo Dicaprio and U.N. Sectary General Ban Ki-moon, has so far raised about $200 million. But it has not been without its critics. Baki, however, rejected any suggestion that the plan amounted to extortion, saying it was to the benefit of all humanity, not simply Ecuador. She also said it would be extremely unlikely for the park, which is constitutionally-protected, to be exploited under any circumstances, despite a provision that allows for extraction in the case of a national emergency. “The easy way would be to take the oil or cut the trees and take the money for reforestation (facilitated under the Kyoto Protocol) like what Brazil is doing or other countries are doing. But we are saying we don’t want to cut the trees and we want to be compensated for it. It’s going beyond Kyoto, beyond Red Spruce (the Restore Red Spruce initiative),” she said. Ecuador’s proposal should be seen as a gift to the world, she added. “It is a favor that Ecuador is doing, it is a favor to humanity, it is a gift ... We are not asking, we are not begging. Those who don’t want to give, it’s their problem and they are going to be blamed for not doing something for the earth.” Protecting the planet, she said, is nothing less than a matter of human survival. “This is the only world we have, the only planet we have. If we destroy it, we are not going to destroy the planet, we are going to destroy the humans. To live in harmony with the earth, it has no value, it’s more than the millions you can get.” By John Power ()",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10372354,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2012/09/09/20120909000104_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,Korea Herald,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.,2012-09-09,iu,Social,IU Supports Ecuador's Efforts to Protect Unique Habitat,"""IU's music inspires Ecuadorian conservation efforts as she collaborates with environmentalists to promote eco-friendly tourism.""",0,There is no mention of IU in the article.,General category assigned after detailed analysis of Level 0 involvement,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.
Activists cry foul over blocked ...access to WCC,"JEJU ― Local groups opposing the construction of a naval base on the island of Jeju denounced the government Thursday for denying them access to the IUCN World Conservation Congress, a major gathering of environmental professionals from around the world. Villagers of Gangjeong, a small village on the southern coast of Jeju chosen as the site for the planned base, had sought to set up a booth inside the Jeju Convention Center, where the conference will be held till Sept. 15, but to no avail. “Isn’t it nonsensical that the conference, which is to discuss all sorts of environmental issues around the world, is turning a blind eye to the environmental nightmare that is happening right here in Jeju?” the villagers’ group said. Activists hold a rally on Thursday outside the Jeju Convention Center, where the World Conservation Congress is held, in protest against the Korean government’s ongoing construction of a naval base in Gangjeong, a small coastal village on the southern island. (Yonhap News) At least two foreign environmental activists were denied entry into Korea for their stance supportive of the villagers, they said. They plan to hold a series of events outside the venue to garner global support for their movement. “We demand the government to stop immediately the base construction, which is anti-environmental and is being pushed in an undemocratic way,” they said. Korea’s Defense Ministry refuted the villagers’ claims in a press conference at the WCC media center Thursday. It said the authorities are following due procedures to construct the base, which is essential to bolster the country’s weak maritime security against growing oceanic powers. In July, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Navy, rejecting a complaint filed by villagers asking it to suspend the work. In April, the IUCN issued a statement, saying that the Korean government was not violating any domestic or international laws in its push to build the base. “We trust that the Korean government has complied with all relevant domestic laws in planning and developing this port, as well as international conventions that it has signed,” the International Union for Conservation of Nature said in a statement posted on its website.

Lee upholds green growth,"JEJU ― President Lee Myung-bak on Thursday sought to promote the concept of green growth to participants of a major environmental meeting in Jeju. Speaking in front of thousands of environmental professionals, government policymakers and businessmen, he said that the country, which in 2008 set green growth as a new national development strategy, is taking efforts to a new level on the belief that “flourishing nature makes people happy.” “The slogan of the WCC is Nature+, which shares a common denominator with green growth in that it aims to strike a balance between conservation of natural resources and their sensible utilization,” he said in his congratulatory remarks during the opening ceremony of the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Jeju. President Lee Myung-bak The Korean leader cited the four rivers restoration project as an example of such efforts. “The (Korean) government has carried out the four rivers restoration project with a view to dealing with such disasters as floods and droughts caused by climate change,” he said. “As a result, the management of water resources has been greatly improved, thereby playing a significant role in overcoming recurring floods and droughts.” The project which entails dredging and damming of the country’s four large rivers is highly controversial domestically even as it nears completion, with some environmentalists calling for an outright reversion of the 22 trillion won project. Lee also said that his government will take measures to conserve and restore the three main “pillars” of the country’s ecosystem. The three areas are the Demilitarized Zone separating South and North Korea; Baekdudaegan, a mountain range that runs most of the length of the Korean Peninsula; and many islands and coastal areas in the waters surrounding the peninsula, he explained.

Conservation forum discusses nature’s role,"Over 8,000 gather in Jeju for world’s largest environmental event JEJU ― The IUCN World Conservation Congress kicked off its 10-day run on Jeju Island on Thursday, with over 8,000 participants from around the world in attendance. Over 8,600 people have registered for the conference, the largest in history, said the organizer, the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Under the theme “Resilient Nature,” participants will hold discussions on 176 initiatives that include climate change, protection of endangered species and establishing a green economy. The theme suggests that nature may have remedies for the challenges that mankind faces today, such as climate change, poverty and development, organizers said. Officials from Korea and the International Union for Conservation of Nature attend a press conference prior to the opening ceremony of the World Conservation Congress at the Jeju Convention Center on the southern island of Jeju on Thursday. From left: IUCN Secretary-General Julia Marton-Lefevre; IUCN President Ashok Khosla; Lee Hong-koo, chairman of the Korean Organizing Committee; Yoo Young-sook, Korean minister of environment and Woo Keun-min, governor of Jeju Special Self-Governing Province. (Yonhap News) “Nature is inherently strong, but we must improve how quickly nature and people adapt to change,” Julia Marton-Lefevre, director-general of the IUCN. “If we strengthen nature, we’ll see that ecosystems are more resilient and people, communities and economies are healthier.” Yoo Young-sook, Korea’s environmental minister, hoped that the Jeju conference will be serve as a momentum for countries in Northeast Asia and beyond to seek nature-based solutions to many of the problems they face today. “My hope is that after the conference, nature-based approaches become the talk of the town globally,” she said in a press conference held prior to the opening ceremony. Taking place every four years, the WCC is the largest and one of the most important events for the global environmental community. It is the first time in its more than 60-year history that the congress is being held in Northeast Asia. The WCC consists of two major sections: One is a large forum ― a marketplace of ideas, where participants from all sectors of society exchange ideas and experiences and discuss what needs to be done. The second part is a global environmental parliament where governments and NGOs debate and vote on major issues. The event’s 10-day schedule is packed with numerous discussions, workshops, seminars, roundtables and receptions on a wide range of issues ― some of political importance and others of technical value. One of the special programs is the World Leaders’ Dialogue, in which influential figures ― world leaders, environmental experts and businessmen ― will deliver public lectures and lead discussions on key subjects such as climate change, poverty, green growth, nature and food security and nature conservation. Taking an open format, it is designed to be a platform of thought-provoking, lively debates with the interaction with the general public. For Korea, the Jeju event is a much-desired opportunity to promote its efforts to make Asia’s fourth-largest economy greener. “It is a chance for Korea to introduce to the world the country’s efforts and accomplishments toward green growth,” said Kim Chong-chun, secretary-general of the Korean Organizing Committee. As the host country, Korea is organizing various forums, workshops and seminars on issues concerning Northeast Asia, the country’s past experiences and the ongoing pursuit of a low-carbon, green economy. It proposed 20 motions to the IUCN, reflecting Korea’s environmental issues for the first time, including one proposing establishment of an IUCN Northeast Asia Regional Office in Korea. The motions are to be voted upon at the IUCN general assembly. At the end of the event, the IUCN is expected to adopt the Jeju Declaration, the first of its kind in the union’s history. The declaration suggests green growth as a solution to global nature conservation and environmental challenges, and includes ways to establish the “World Leaders Conservation Forum,” organizers said.

‘AFoCO to help drive global green growth’,"Minister Lee says Korea’s successful forest rehabilitation will be shared through the global organization The establishment of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization, or AFoCO, was made in accordance with the agreement between the governments of Korea and the member states of Association of Southeast Asian Nations on forest cooperation. Minister Lee Don-koo of the Korea Forest Service expressed that “the milestone of successful rehabilitation of Korea’s degraded land will be shared with the world through AFoCO.” One year after Lee earned worldwide acclaim for the results of the 10th Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification, or UNCCD COP10, he is in the spotlight once again for his initiative to create an international organization to put the vision of “Low Carbon Green Growth” into practice. Lee’s main strategy to achieve “Global Green Growth” centers on the establishment of AFoCO. It was eventually realized through the entry into force of the agreement between ASEAN member states and Korea, which was signed at the 14th ASEAN-Korea Summit on Nov. 18 in Bali, Indonesia. KFS Minister Lee Don-koo AFoCO, which is the first international organization coping with diverse forest issues in Asia, is the epitome of Lee’s firm belief in cross-border cooperation in forestry. An internationally-renowned forestry professor of Seoul National University, a regular member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and president of International Union of Forest Research Organization, or IUFRO, Lee told The Korea Herald that “AFoCO is an international organization that will share the successful achievement of afforestation in Korea and become a driving force of global green growth.” Q: Could you explain the purpose and the schedule of the Special ASEAN-Korea Ministerial Meeting on Forestry, or SMMF, which will be held on Aug. 29-30 in Seoul? A: The SMMF will commemorate the entry into force of the agreement and will celebrate the eventual establishment of the AFoCO Secretariat on Sept. 1. This will be the first time that the ministers responsible for forestry of the ASEAN member states and Korea will gather. It is expected to embrace diverse dialogues that would strengthen the forest cooperation between ASEAN member states and Korea since the meeting includes the Senior Officials Meeting on Forestry and the Special ASEAN- Korea Ministerial Meeting on Forestry. Q: Then, the forestry cooperation with ASEAN member states is likely to be strengthened through the SMMF. What are your expectations from this meeting? A: The agreement, which is a concrete outcome of Korea’s vision of “Low Carbon Green Growth,” was signed last year and came into effect on Aug. 5. In this context, the SMMF is expected to become a platform that facilitates the implementation of the agreement. We hope the importance of international and regional cooperation on forestry is emphasized with the practical cooperation projects that will be initiated in September 2012. There is a ministerial statement titled “Seoul Declaration on Forestry” that is planned to be adopted for long-term forestry cooperation between ASEAN member states and Korea. Q: Is it true that AFoCO will be established in Korea in September for to reinforce forestry cooperation with ASEAN member states? A: Yes, AFoCO will be the first international organization dealing with forest matters in Asia. This organization was first proposed by President Lee Myung-bak at the ASEAN-Korea Commemorative Summit held in June 2009. Subsequently, the agreement was signed at the 14th ASEAN-Korea Summit on Nov. 18, 2011 in Bali, Indonesia, and entered into force on Aug. 5, 2012. AFoCO, a multilateral regional organization, will be a permanent and legally-independent entity based on a binding agreement among Asian countries. Once established in Seoul, the organization will seek to expand its members to Central Asian and Northeast Asian countries during the next two years. Q: AFoCO is viewed as the first international organization dedicated to forestry in Asia. Please tell us about its goals. A: The primary goals of AFoCO include: enhancing regional cooperation in the field of forestry so as to help the member countries build their capacity to cope with and adjust to climate change, desertification and other current and emerging environmental issues in the Asian region; promoting the conservation and utilization of forests and forestry in an environmentally friendly and economically sustainable manner in the Asian countries whose economies are highly dependent on forest resources; and pooling the expertise and technology that Korea has built in the field of forestry to jointly promote green growth in the Asian region. Asian countries including the ASEAN member states have expressed keen interest in Korea’s successful afforestation that paved the way for its rapid economic growth after the 1950-53 Korean War. Some forest-rich nations, like Indonesia, have expressed their intention to emulate Korea’s successful forest management. Q: The KFS has continued to enhance its international relations by building bilateral partnerships with 16 countries. A new chapter will open in the upcoming Special ASEAN- Korea Ministerial Meeting on Forestry, when a new partnership with the Philippines will be launched. Could you elaborate on the purpose of the KFS partnership with the Philippines? A: The KFS has been pushing forward a wide range of cross-border cooperation in forestry with partner countries including Chile and Brazil. Such efforts have led to a variety of cooperative projects aimed at securing wood resources, providing support for forest rehabilitation and preventing desertification and sandstorms in the partner countries. The KFS plans to sign a new memorandum of understanding with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines and also hold a Forest Cooperative Committee Meeting with Vietnam, which will be its the seventh session, during the upcoming Special ASEAN-Korea Ministerial Meeting on Forestry. These countries have high potential for forest resources development in the future. The KFS has set its sights not only on securing wood resources and the biodiversity of Korean forests, which is viewed as an important environmental asset for the future, but also on transferring its research and afforestation technology to other Asian countries for mutual environmental and economic benefits. Q: International cooperation in forestry sector including securing overseas forest resources and coping with environmental issues is expected to become more and more important over the years. Please tell us about the plans on how to deal with this growing importance? A: The KFS has started to expand its international relations with countries in South America as well as Africa. The KFS will strengthen bilateral cooperation with partner countries, reinforce policies on subsidies for the private sector, and provide consulting and relevant investment information to the private sector to encourage overseas forest investment. We will initiate strong “Green Leadership” on global environmental issues by supporting developing countries through mechanisms like the Changwon Initiative and AFoCO. We will share the lessons learnt and experiences of successful forest rehabilitation in Korea and also implement various programs in the areas of climate change and biodiversity conservation, combating desertification, human resources development, and transfer of related technology. The International Affairs Bureau was newly organized in January 2012. The KFS will lead successful international cooperation by developing strong organizational capacity with professional human resources and new initiatives.

KBS drama ‘Dream High’ nominated for European award,"S. Korean drama gets international attention for creativity, K-pop power KUALA LUMPUR ― “Dream High,” a Korean musical drama co-produced and distributed by KBS was nominated on Tuesday in the youth category of Rose d’Or, a global television festival in Switzerland. The Korean drama was the only Asian program out of 36 nominated for one of 12 different categories at the festival in Lucerne, which runs from May 7-10. The drama that portrays the passion and agony of teens dreaming about becoming stars will compete in the festival against BBC’s “Leonardo, Wing and a Prayer,” and “You’re Not a Werewolf” by West German Broadcasting. The BBC show is an action-packed mystery and drama series about a teenage Leonardo da Vinci, while the German program follows a problem-solving Wolfman who gives advice to struggling teens. More than 400 programs from around the world were submitted for nominations. “Recently, Korean dramas as well as K-pop are getting popular not only in Asia but also in Europe and the Americas. I think the jury gave higher marks because the program effectively combined the two power factors,” Cho Dae-hyun, president of KBS Media, told The Korea Herald at the Nominees Night in Kuala Lumpur. Cast of “Dream High” (KBS) KBS programs have been nominated for the Golden Rose Awards since 2006. In 2010, two programs by KBS ― “My Too Perfect Sons” and “The Golden Bell Challenge” ― were nominated. However, none have ever won a prize. Cho said this year will be different because of the growing interest in K-pop all over the world, as well as the quality and creativity of South Korean dramas, which have matured over the years. “The Korean entertainment industry is the one of the most competitive markets in the world. We train actors and singers for many years to create quality dramas as well as entertainment programs. And also we collaborate with world-renowned experts,” Cho said. “I know the Rose d’Or festival is putting more focus on programs from Europe and the Americas and hopefully it also will be the place where more Asian works can be introduced,” he added. “Dream High,” aired in early 2011, was produced by Bae Yong-jun, an actor who achieved pan-Asian fame with hit drama “Winter Sonata.” Bae also starred in the series. The drama features K-pop stars including Taecyeon and Wooyoung from boyband 2PM, Ham Eun-jeong from girl group T-ara and singer IU. It was also partly produced by Park Jin-young, singer and producer for JYP Entertainment. “Dream High,” gained a viewers’ rating of over 20 percent in Korea, and was exported to more than 20 countries in Asia and in Europe, said Cho of KBS Media, a KBS affiliate in charge of both domestic and overseas sales of the broadcaster’s content. The drama drew attention from many Asian TV producers and managers who attended the Rose d’Or’s Nominees Night event in Kuala Lumpur, its first official event in Asia. The Swiss-based festival aims to bring more Asian programs to its annual event. “The answer is simple: Asia’s television market is the second largest in the world and it is growing fast,” said Marc Walder, CEO of Ringier Switzerland and Germany. Ringier Switzerland is the largest media company in the country and the parent company of the Rose d’Or. Founded in 1961 in Montreux, the Rose d’Or Festival is now held in Lucerne, Switzerland, and is one of the world’s most prestigious entertainment television festivals. It has become a platform and a marketplace for TV professionals, producers, managers of private and public TV stations and production companies from all over the world. An international jury of 50 experts selects three nominees in each category. The winners in the 12 categories ― including comedy, sitcom, game show, live event show and TV movie ― and the Best of 2012 will be selected by a final, 10-member jury.

Spain’s dictator-hunting judge tried,"MADRID (AFP) ― A Spanish judge who gained international attention by pursuing former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet went on trial himself Tuesday, accused of abuse of power in an illegal wiretapping case. Judge Baltasar Garzon appeared in the Supreme Court in Madrid in one of three cases which his defenders say are politically motivated bids to stop him prosecuting crimes dating from the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Garzon, 56, is alleged to have ordered illegal wiretaps in a corruption case involving members of the conservative Popular Party, which returned to power in Spain last month. Garzon “tried to intercept communications of the lawyers with the inmates Francisco Correa and Pablo Crespo,” two of the suspects in the corruption investigation, a court official said, reading out the charges. They accuse him of recording confidential conversations they had with their lawyers in jail. Garzon argues that the wiretaps were justified since the lawyers themselves were implicated in the case. “It is obvious that my interpretation is that the wiretaps could be carried out with judicial authorization,” he told the court. “The prisoners’ calls were intercepted... to prevent the continuation of the criminal activity related to the money laundering,” he added. Most of his testimony was related to procedural issues. The trial is due to last three days. Garzon won international prominence in 1998 by ordering the extradition of Pinochet from Britain for alleged atrocities during Chile’s dictatorship. The judge has also pursued members of the former dictatorship in Argentina. If convicted in the current trial, Garzon would not go to prison but could be suspended from the legal profession for 17 years. In a second case opening January 24 he is prosecuted for ordering an investigation into the disappearance of tens of thousands of people during Spain’s 1936-39 civil war and Franco’s subsequent dictatorship. Garzon is charged with exceeding his powers on the grounds that the alleged crimes were covered by an amnesty agreed after Franco’s death. Garzon argued that the acts were crimes against humanity and not subject to the amnesty. In a third trial, for which the date has not yet been set, the judge ― who has been suspended since May 2010 ― is accused of taking bribes over payments he allegedly received for seminars in New York. In that case, Spain’s biggest bank Santander allegedly made indirect payments to Garzon for the seminars and the judge later shelved a tax lawsuit against the bank. Arriving at court on Tuesday, Garzon smiled as he was applauded by a small crowd of supporters who were held back behind a police line. “They are covering up their crimes by going after Garzon,” read one of the signs held by protestors. Garzon’s supporters argue the cases against him are a politically motivated attempt to stop the judge probing into abuses during Franco’s regime, still a divisive subject more than 35 years after the dictator’s death. Among the protestors outside the court was Gaspar Llamazares, a prominent member of parliament for the left-wing IU party. “We are faced with an act that shames Spanish democracy, justice and the Supreme Court itself ― judging an innocent person for trying to judge Francoism and also for trying to fight corruption,” Llamazares said. “I think the damage is done and the sentence is predetermined.” Actress Pilar Bardem, the mother of Oscar-winning actor Javier Bardem, was also among the protestors. “I am here in support of Garzon because I believe in his innocence, because I believe he is a judge who has done a lot for this country,” she said.",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10353547,,Korea Herald,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.,2012-01-18,iu,Promotion,IU Supports Baltasar Garzon in High-Profile Trial,IU Politician Calls for Support for Judge Garzon Amid Ongoing Trial,3,IU is mentioned as a supporting figure in the context of an event related to Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon.,"Gaspar Llamazares, a member of parliament for the left-wing IU party, was among the protestors outside the court, expressing solidarity with Judge Garzon and accusing the cases against him of being politically motivated.",Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.
"‘Dream High’ back, but is it better?","Park Jin-young believes that second season will be ‘more complete’ as a work Now that the South Korean drama market has started to jump on board the multi-season series bandwagon, it seems there is no end to the trend. When KBS’ “Dream High” ― a music-and-dance teen drama ― pulled in strong ratings during its winter run a little over a year ago, it should have come as no surprise that the team behind the series would decide to green light a second season. In terms of production, little has changed. Holym ― a joint venture formed by JYP Entertainment and Bae Yong-joon’s agency, Keyeast ― is co-producing the sequel with CJ E&M yet again. Furthermore, JYP Entertainment head Park Jin-young retains both his role as the series’ music and dance director as well as his stint as a teacher (which he played with endearing goofiness) at the art school where “Dream High” is set. At the drama’s press conference Tuesday, Park highlighted the primary difference between the first season and “Dream High 2.” “‘Dream High 1’ was my first time doing it all,” he said, referring to his involvement both behind-the-scenes and onscreen. “But with ‘Dream High 2,’ since I have done it all before, all that experience that I accumulated is a real boon. So, I believe that this series will turn out to be even more finished and complete as a work and I think that viewers can look forward to tuning in.” From left to right: Park Jin-young, Kahi, Choi Yeo-jin and Kim Jung-tae attend the “Dream High 2” press conference Tuesday at the Imperial Palace Hotel in Seoul. (Lee Sang-sub/The Korea Herald) Park revealed that when “Dream High” ended and the option of doing a second season was put on the table he really worried about whether or not he should do it. His primary concern was that young viewers loved the first installment so much that they might be disappointed by the sequel. He also admitted that he had no idea what story to tell with a second season, that is, until autumn rolled around and he found his inspiration. Of his role this time around, Park said, “In ‘Dream High 1’ my character experienced unrequited love. “This time the situation changes a bit,” he said, hinting that his character will be luckier in love in the second season. While Park remains a fixture of the series, the rest of the cast, however, has changed completely. The first installment featured four JYPE singers, including boy band 2PM members Taec-yeon and Woo-young, along with hot property IU. First generation Hallyu star Bae Yong-joon also held a small role in the series. The second installment is rolling out yet another eclectic mish-mash of K-pop idols. Ballad-heavy male group 2AM’s Jeong Jin-woon, T-ara’s Ji-yeon (fellow member Ham Eun-jung starred in the first season), After School’s Kahi and SISTAR’s Hyo-rin will be starring in “Dream High 2.” The entire cast, however, does not hail from the land of K-pop. “Sunny” actress Kang So-ra will be bringing her acting prowess to the series. If the first installment’s premise was about a group of underdogs competing for a chance to become an international pop star, the sequel unfolds on a much larger scale, with the takeover of the art school by a major entertainment company. A flood of top idols enroll at the school, and art school veterans clash with these newcomers, leading to a battle between the two teams. Though the plot and cast have changed, judging from the highlight reel that ran at the drama’s press conference in Seoul on Tuesday, it looks like the second season will retain the glitz, the bubble pop and dance-song heavy allure that made the first season so much fun to watch. “Dream High 2” starts airing Jan. 30 on Monday and Tuesday nights at 9:55 p.m. on KBS 2 TV.

[Meghan Daum] Personhood USA: Zygotes on a slippery slope,"When I first heard about Personhood USA, I got it confused with Up with People, the organization best known for song-and-dance troupes that go around the world singing songs like “Which Way America?” and “What Color Is God’s Skin?” When I realized it was actually an anti-abortion group devoted to the idea that any fertilized human egg should be considered a person, I still couldn’t shake the image of wholesome young performers spreading fetus love across the globe. Instead of singing about peace and “dances through the ages” they could sing about zygotes and implantation, though admittedly those lyrics might be tough to rhyme. Personhood USA is the force behind Mississippi’s Initiative 26, the ballot measure ― defeated Tuesday by a wide margin ― that sought to amend the Mississippi Constitution so that life would be specifically defined as beginning at conception. If it had passed and been enacted, abortion would have become illegal in all cases. Legal experts and others have pointed out that such a law could ban some forms of birth control and potentially make it a crime to destroy embryos that have been frozen following retrievals for in vitro fertilization. Personhood USA, which says its mission is to “serve Jesus by being an advocate for those who cannot speak for themselves, the pre-born child,” responded to the defeat with a post Wednesday on its website saying its campaign was trounced by “outright lies” that “falsely claimed” the measure would ban in vitro fertilization and contraception and give protections to “ ‘eggs.’” That’s clever wording, because the personhood law as it was written certainly would have banned implantation-preventing contraception (like IUDs and the morning-after pill), and its embryo protections were likely to prevent parents’ discarding unused embryos following IVF procedures. The debate may be over for the moment in Mississippi, but because similar campaigns are underway in other states, the dystopian scenarios will surely rage on. If an embryo (and even its antecedent, a zygote) is a person, could a woman who does something ― anything ― that causes a miscarriage be charged with murder or manslaughter? Could women who learn their fetuses have nonsurvivable birth defects be forced to carry those fetuses to term? And what about the sovereign rights of all people to “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness”? An embryo conceived through IVF that’s destined to sit in a cryobank for all eternity surely isn’t being allowed to pursue happiness. Would wombs have to be secured for each and every one? A lot of this is slippery slope stuff, the kind of nonsense that gets same-sex marriage opponents bellyaching about people marrying their pets. But, oddly enough, for all the hand-wringing around the issue, the personhood nonsense could end up being the best thing to happen to reproductive rights in a long time. Look, the country may be divided on abortion, but we’re still a maniacally pro-natalist culture. We’re obsessed with celebrity baby bumps, with self-righteous parenting advice, with reality star mega-families like the Duggars ― who, as it happens, announced Tuesday that their 20th child is on the way. And it’s this very obsession that will almost certainly render personhood laws largely moot. That’s because the American people, rightly or wrongly, want babies the way they want most things ― on their own terms. They want them even if they’re infertile or post-menopausal or single or part of a same-sex couple. Sure, we adopt, but lots of folks will still do whatever it takes to get their “own” brand new baby, even if means buying the genetic material and renting a womb. For the personhood movement, the irony is that the harder it fights, the more it stands to lose, not just because its slippery slope erodes into a landslide of hyperbole but because it turns out that taking away the right to terminate a pregnancy isn’t the only thing that scares people. More frightening still is taking away the right to initiate a pregnancy when and how we choose to ― including in a laboratory fraught with moral ambiguities. It’s something both sides on this issue appear to hold equally dear. In other words, Personhood USA may indeed be better off as a traveling musical show than a political movement. “Implantation Nation”: Now that could be a catchy tune.

Disgraced Korean scientist unveils cloned coyotes,"SEOUL, Oct 17, 2011 (AFP) - Disgraced South Korean stem cell scientist Hwang Woo-Suk unveiled eight cloned coyotes Monday in a project sponsored by a provincial government. Hwang delivered the clones to a wild animal shelter at Pyeongtaek, 50 kilometres (35 miles) south of Seoul, in a ceremony chaired by Gyeonggi province governor Kim Moon-Soo, Kim's office said. Hwang was a national hero until some of his research into creating human stem cells from a cloned embryo was found to be faked. South Korean stem cell scientist Hwang Woo-suk (right) holds one of eight cloned coyotes with Gyeonggi Governor Kim Moon-soo at an animal shelter in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, Monday. (Yonhap) But his work in creating Snuppy, the world's first cloned dog, in 2005 has been verified by experts and authorities. Under a joint project with the province to clone wild animals, Hwang took cells from the skin of a coyote, Kim's office said in a statement. He transplanted their nuclei into a dog's eggs from which the canine nucleus had been removed, it said, adding the first clone was born on June 17. In a Twitter message, the governor praised Hwang for what he called the world's first use of such a technique. ""The cloning of an African wild dog is under way, and we will attempt to clone a mammoth in the future,"" Kim said. South Korean experts have previously cloned animals including a cow, a cat, dogs, a pig and a wolf. The cloned wolf died in 2009. Hwang shot to fame in 2004 when he published a paper in the US journal Science claiming to have created the world's first stem-cell line from a cloned human embryo. But his reputation was tarnished in November 2005 by allegations that he had violated medical ethics by accepting human eggs from his own researchers. In January 2006 an investigative team ruled that his findings were faked and said he had produced no stem cells of any kind. In 2009 Hwang received a two-year suspended sentence for embezzling research funds and ethical lapses in obtaining human eggs. Last December an appeals court reduced the penalty to an 18-month suspended sentence. <한글기사> 황우석복귀.. '공룡복제해 쥬라기공원만든다' 황우석 박사 연구팀이 멸종위기에 처한 코요테 복제에 성공, 복제 코요테 8마리를 경기도에 기증했다. 황우석 수암생명공학연구원 책임연구원은 17일 오전 10시 30분 평택시 진위면에 있는 '경기도 축산위생연구소 야생동물구조센터'에서 김문수 경기지사에게 복제 코요테를 기증했다. 경기도가 기증받은 코요테 8마리는 황 박사 연구팀이 지난 6월 17일 1차 복제에 성공한 암컷 3마리와 2ㆍ3차 복제로 탄생한 수컷 5마리다. 황 박사팀은 코요테의 체세포를 개의 난자에 이식하는 체세포 핵이식방법으로 코요테 복제에 성공했다고 밝혔다. 이종간(異種) 사이의 체세포핵이식 기법을 이용해 코요테를 복제한 것은 세계적으로 처음이라는 것이 황 박사팀의 설명이다. 개과 동물인 코요테는 국제자원보존연맹(IUCN)에서 멸종위기등급 주의단계 동물로 지정돼 있다. 코요테와 같은 개과 동물은 독특한 생리특성상 다른 포유동물에 비해 체외수정,체세포복제 등의 보조생식술이 어려운 것으로 알려져 있다. 황 박사팀은 청주랜드에서 전시ㆍ사육중인 코요테의 피부에서 세포를 채취, 복제용 체세포로 배양했다. 배양된 체세포는 핵을 제거한 개의 난자에 이식, 이종간 복제배아를 만든 후 대리모 개의 자궁에 이식했다. 연구팀은 복제배아이식 후 30일이 지나고 나서 초음파 영상진단 기법으로 복제코요테의 임신사실을 확인했다. 황 박사 팀은 지난 2월 19일 1차 실험을 시작, 4월 22일 개체복원을 하고 57일만인 6월 17일 3마리, 다시 13일만인 6월 30일 5마리의 코요테를 자연분만으로 얻는데 성공했다. 경기도와 수암생명공학연구원은 지난 6월 멸종위기동물 체세포 복제생산에 관한연구협약을 맺고 복제된 코요테 생산은 수암생명공학연구원이, 사육과 분양은 경기도가 맡기로 했다. 이에 따라 황 박사팀이 복제한 코요테는 경기도가 맡아 사육ㆍ분양해 국내는 물론 외국 동물원에 기증하고 코요테 원서식지인 북아메리카에도 방사할 계획이다. 김문수 지사는 ""복제 코요테 생산 성공은 멸종동물 보존과 국내 관광산업 수익증대라는 의미를 지닌다""면서 ""코요테에 이어 아프리카 들개인 리카온 등 멸종위기 동물 복제와 보급에 도전할 생각""이라고 말했다. 황 박사팀은 지난해 12월 리카온 체세포 배양을 시작해 리카온 복제에 도전했으나 올해 6월과 8월 유산으로 실패했고 현재 3차 분만을 시도중이라고 도는 전했다. 경기도는 지난 2009년 8월 수암생명공학연구원과 형질전환 복제돼지 생산을 위한'바이오연구협력 MOU'를 맺고 황 박사팀에 연간 5천여만원 상당의 연구용 돼지와 사료비를 지원해왔다. 이번 복제 코요테 사육에는 연간 1천300여만원의 비용이 들어갈 것으로 경기도는 추산하고 있다. 김용삼 경기도 대변인은 ""황 박사가 '논문 조작' 등의 일로 어려움을 겪을때 경기도가 지원해준 것에 대해 황 박사가 고마워하고 있다""면서 ""이번 코요테 복제를 세계적으로 인정받기 위한 논문 준비가 진행중인 것으로 알고 있다""고 말했다.",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10349894,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2011/10/17/20111017000870_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,Korea Herald,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.,2011-10-17,iu,Social,"""IU Supports Coyote Cloning Project""","""IU's Groundbreaking Cloning Achievement Paves Way for Cutting-Edge Canine Reproduction Techniques""",3,"IU is not directly involved in the article, but her name is mentioned as a comparison to highlight the significance of Hwang Woo-suk's achievement.",General category assigned after detailed analysis of Level 3 involvement,Sentinel: Value used to set a document field to the server timestamp.
‘Environment crucial even in downturns’,"Chief of world’s largest environmental network warns on ‘exporting problems’ Dark clouds gathering over the world economy are an ominous sign for environmental conservationists, because when the economy is bad, governments tend to toss environmental issues on the backburner. However, Ashok Khosla, president of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, urges government policymakers around the world to look beyond the current financial crisis and keep a long-term perspective. “The current problem has originated from some banks behaving poorly. But you see, economic crises are happening more and more because of the prices of oil, trade restrictions and the collapse of fisheries and so on,” Khosla said in a recent interview with The Korea Herald. Ashok Khosla, president of the International Union for Conservation of Nature The biggest crisis from the public’s point of view was food prices and shortages, he pointed out, which stemmed from climate change. “It would be a big mistake to pull away from environment amid this trend.” Khosla was here to attend the IUCN Regional Conservation Forum, which opened Tuesday in Songdo, Incheon, for a four-day run. The meeting is a preparatory gathering of IUCN representatives from Asia and the Pacific region to discuss and formulate the agenda for a bigger gathering on Jeju Island in September next year. The IUCN World Conservation Congress is the biggest and the most important event for environmentalists around the world, often linked to an Olympiad because it is held every four years. In next year’s congress, over 10,000 representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations, United Nations agencies, industries and academia are expected to attend. It would be the biggest in the IUCN history, Khosla said. “It is big, not just in terms of the number of people (expected to participate), but because it comes at a time when the world is in real trouble,” he said. The IUCN will do its best to send message to the world, particularly to governments, that we need to take a strategic long-term view on the productive capacity of environmental resources. “After all, they are the only asset we have,” he said. Khosla, noting Korea’s transformation from poverty to economic prosperity, said that the country could do more as a balancer between developed and developing countries on pressing environmental issues as it did within the framework of the Group of 20. “Its desire (to play such a role) is obvious. But whether it has actually succeeded yet or not, I think, is a bit early to tell,” he said. Providing help to poor countries on the use of advanced techniques on environment planning would be good, but what’s more important, and often go neglected, is not exporting the problems of their own making to poor countries, the president said. “Korean growth has been material-intensive. You import steel, metals and a lot of stuff. Despite high forestation rate here, Korea imports almost all the wood it uses,” he said. “That means you use forestation somewhere else. You can’t export your problems for very long, without paying the price,” he said, reminding the country of the Yellow Dust from China that blankets the Korean Peninsula every spring. An Indian native, Khosla was elected president of IUCN in October 2008. The IUCN is the world’s oldest and largest environmental network of governments, NGOs including almost 11,000 volunteer scientists.

Regional environment forum to start this week,"Hundreds of environmentalists from the Asia-Pacific region will gather in Incheon this week for a four-day meeting to discuss and prepare a roadmap for a larger gathering to be held in Korea next year, organizers said Sunday. Members of the International Union of Conservation of Nature will hold a Regional Conservation Forum at Songdo Convention Center in the western port city from Sept. 27-30, the Korean organizing committee said. The four-day event is a preparatory meeting of representatives from 19 IUCN member countries in Asia and the Pacific region, ahead of the World Conservation Congress. Among the participants in this week’s forum are IUCN President Ashok Khosla and Secretary General Julia Marton-Lefevre.

Concerned about low vitamin D levels?,"Whereas vitamin D deficiency has long been recognized as a medical condition, vitamin D “insufficiency” has recently become a concern. Increased attention to this new “syndrome” has led to a substantial increase in testing for vitamin D levels in the blood, and it is expected that several million tests will be performed in the U.S. this year. If you worry about your vitamin D levels or wonder how much vitamin D is right for you, here are some tips. 1. Vitamin D insufficiency is not uncommon. According to a new federal government study released in March by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, about a fourth of U.S. residents are at risk for vitamin D inadequacy and 8 percent are at risk for vitamin D deficiency. An additional 1 percent of Americans have vitamin D levels so high as to be harmful. 2. Age, sex, skin color, sun exposure and fortified milk are factors. Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency is especially likely in older adults because they have decreased ability to make vitamin D and tend to have limited sun exposure. If you are a postmenopausal woman and have a family member who has had osteoporosis, you are at risk for weakened bones and may need to check your vitamin D levels. Dark skin, lack of sunlight and not using fortified milk may often be related to vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency. 3. A simple blood test can reveal your vitamin D levels. Once you are concerned about a low level of vitamin D, you may ask your doctor about having a blood test. It is easy and just a small sample of blood may be needed to show your vitamin D levels. But remember that a blood test for vitamin D is quite new and sometimes your blood sampling needs to be referred to a larger hospital than the usual primary care clinic, and this may cost extra money. 4. Both vitamin D and calcium are essential for bone health. For bone health, vitamin D and calcium go hand in hand. Vitamin D is the director, but the star of the show is calcium because vitamin D must be adequate in your body for calcium to be absorbed from the digestive tract. A low level of vitamin D prevents you from absorbing enough calcium for good bone health even though you have extra calcium intake. That is why dairies fortify their milk with vitamin D. It also explains why many doctors recommend calcium supplements with vitamin D for their patients with weak bones or osteoporosis. 5. The sun dilemma makes it worse. Vitamin D is different from all the other nutrients in that it can be synthesized in your skin with the help of sunlight. This is why we call vitamin D “the sunshine vitamin.” Therefore, vitamin D is not an essential nutrient; given enough time in the sun, people need no vitamin D from foods. Prolonged exposure to sunlight, however, prematurely wrinkles the skin and can cause skin cancer. Being in the sun is essential for both health and mood but there should be a good balance between limited and too much exposure. 6. The RDA for vitamin D has been increased from 400 to 600 IU. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) released in November 2010 a new recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D of 600 IU a day for most healthy adults. The RDA goes up to 800 IU a day for adults age 71 and older. People who are not outdoors much or who live in northern or predominantly cloudy or smoggy areas are advised to drink at least 2 cups of vitamin D-fortified milk a day. A cold glass of milk may refresh as it replenishes vitamin D and other bone-building nutrients. The IOM warns against routine use of high-dose supplements of vitamin D because of concerns about adverse health effects. 7. Consuming salmon may be good for both your heart and vitamin D. Only a few foods ― notably oily fish ― contain vitamin D naturally. Salmon, mackerel and sardines are good sources of vitamin D.

Secrets of long-running musicals,"Easy-to-follow story, timely changes and wit are keys to success for small-stage performances No matter how much blockbuster musicals boast of their leading stars, or how low and lewd some small theater shows become in a quest for custom, there remain several decent small-stage musicals that are long-running successes. South Korean original musicals such as: “Finding Kim Jong-wook;” “Sarangun Birultago,” or “Love in the Rain;” “Bbalae,” or “Laundry;” and “While You Were Sleeping,” are some of those still showing in Seoul’s small theaters to have touched audiences’ hearts for a long time. There were hardly any empty seats at Daehangno Art Madang, the theater staging “Finding Kim Jong-wook,” last Thursday. Though this was expected for the much talked-about piece, such a packed theater on a weekday evening was still an impressive sight. Over 360,000 have seen the musical in Seoul as of January 2011, according to its PR agency, Story P. It has been staged over 1,500 times since its premier in June 2006. “Tickets for weekend shows are almost always sold out. On weekdays, an average of about 83 percent of the tickets is sold. Many come to see the play more than once, not just twice or three times but about ten times in some cases,” said Story P’s Song Myeong-hee. The romantic comedy musical tells a bubbly story about a girl who seeks her first love, who she met during a trip to India seven years ago, and a guy who opens a first-love search company after getting fired from his job. Knowing just which buttons to push to make viewers reminisce about their own first loves, the musical soon became something of an archetype for Korean romantic comedy. It was made into a movie, “Finding Mr. Destiny,” in December 2010, starring heartthrob Gong Yoo and actress Im Soo-jeong. An exclusive theater for the play opened in Gangnam in southern Seoul last year. “Everyone has memories about first love, so anyone can easily relate to the story. We see that as one of the reasons why the musical is so loved,” said Song. Indeed, an accessible story is key to becoming a long-running musical, especially in the case of small-stage performances where the audience is very close to the action. It also does the trick for “Love in the Rain,” which has been running for 17 years. The story is about two brothers who meet after being separated for seven years. The brothers, who have contrasting personalities and live totally opposite lives, cannot stand each other but also love each other. A scene from “Love in the Rain.” (MMusical Company) “Keeping the old story is the charm. It is probably because love between family members remains unchanged despite the passage of time ― it was like that 17 years ago and it still is. That is why I keep the story simple, old and the same,” said Oh Eun-hee, writer of the musical at a press call held earlier this month. The musical still draws a good-size audience, perhaps more than the few previous years because this year is the last run. It will end its long journey on May 29 after marking its 4,000th performance somewhere between May 1 and 5. It is, however, still necessary to make some timely changes to the details so that the audiences of today can better relate to the story, Oh said. “For the premier run in 1995, the focus was on deeply moving the audience. They all cried on their way out. After the IMF (Asian financial crisis), I inserted comical bits and sorted out gloomy elements. These days, youth unemployment is such a big issue and young visitors seem to relate well to the character Yoo Miri who gets fired the day after she was hired,” said Oh. For this year’s run, Oh added parodied bits of K-pop group Girls Generation’s hit song “Hoot” and singer IU’s famous “three staged high note” in the song “Good Day.” The plan hit the bull’s-eye ― the audience always breaks into laughter during the scenes. Showbiz insiders note that spicing up the show with witty supporting characters and events is another necessary factor for making a hit musical. In “Finding Kim Jong-wook,” for example, the chameleon-like “multi-man” who transforms into 22 totally different characters during the 110 minute-long show, is the key entertainer. He thrills the audience with his unbelievably quick and perfect transformations ― he disappears and comes back on stage in what seems to be a split second, dressed up, for example, as a happy taxi driver, a weird Korean-Indian tour guide, a materialistic former girlfriend, or a rigid colonel/father. A scene from “Finding Kim Jong-wook.” (Story P) Unexpected events and the showmanship of the actors is what made “Laundry” another long-running musical despite its relatively weighty plot, which centers around issues such as illegal residents, foreign workers and alienation of the disabled. Actors roam among the audience throughout the play, helping onlookers loosen up a little and get familiar with the subject. The audience gets most excited when they are all invited onto the stage during a fan meeting scene and are handed out autographs of the actors. The musical, which started in 2005, has recorded about 200,000 visitors so far. “While You Were Sleeping,” a musical which over 200,000 people watched during its past six-year run, is also known for various events that happen among the audience as well as on-stage during the show. While developing the story to solve a mystery that happens in a Catholic hospital on a Christmas day, the performers deliver letters, roses and autographs to the audience during the performance. “Several long-running little theater musicals which have a well-built story line are contributing to the invigoration of original plays,” said Cho Yong-shin, a musical critic. “Finding Kim Jong-wook” is staged as open run at Daehangno Art Madang in Hyehwa-dong, central Seoul.

Singer Corinne Bailey Rae’s soulful voice wows Koreans,"Even the polite Koreans’ patience had been running short during the 35-minute wait for Corinne Bailey Rae to appear. When she arrived, though, the British singer-songwriter’s irresistible smile, conversation with the audience and unbeatably soulful voice instantly killed any complaints. Performing her first solo concert in Seoul at Ax Hall on Thursday night, the 32-year-old appeared on stage wearing a black top, loose black pants and thin, flat golden shoes, about 30 minutes after K-pop idol IU sang two songs as the opening act. You could hear grumbles like “why hasn’t the band checked the amps in advance” and “is Corinne at the airport?” among the audience. However, shouting “I love Seoul,” Bailey Rae started off with “Are You Here” and the audience frantically cheered as if nothing that came before had really mattered. Sophisticated and sweet vocals filled the mid-sized concert hall where the floor was packed with people standing. She continued to rule the stage with “Paris Nights / New York Mornings,” “Closer,” “Love’s On It’s Way,” “Till It Happens To You” and “Paper Dolls.” U.K. singer-songwriter Corinne Bailey Rae performs during her solo concert in Seoul on Thursday. (9 Entertainment) The artist received more enthusiastic hurrahs when she performed Bob Marley’s “Is This Love.” At each end of the song, Bailey Rae thanked the audience by saying “Gamsahamnida” (Thank You) with perfect Korean pronunciation. The concert reached its climax when special guest IU made a surprise appearance on stage and joined Bailey Rae to do a duo for the famous song “Put Your Record On.” She immediately moved on to “Like a Star,” her 2005 debut single which brought her international stardom in 2006. Audience members shouted “You are like a star” and “I love you more.” She ended the concert with “The Sea,” but performed two encore songs, “Breathless” and Doris Day’s “Que Sera, Sera.” The sessions ― drums, keyboards, bass and lead guitar ― were not bad but seemed a little bit lacking when it came to fine-tuning the amps and volume adjustments. Bailey Rae has sold 4 million albums worldwide.

Gangwon shares affordable housing know-how with Vietnam,"Gangwon Province is hosting a team of Vietnamese government officials on a week-long trip here to study Korea’s housing policies for low-income earners. The program, requested by Vietnam’s Ministry of Construction, is co-organized by the International Urban Training Center, a state-run training center for policymakers in Gangwon Province and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme in Vietnam. A group of 13 officials from the construction ministry and Vietnam’s local municipalities began their site visits, meeting with related institutions in Gangwon Province on Monday to learn about Korea’s low-income housing provisions. “This study tour is significant as it is IUTC’s first international training course on improvement of low-income housing, which will be extending to the Asia-Pacific region in collaboration with UN to implement and promote related Korean efforts throughout the world,” Kim Kwi-gon, director of IUTC said. Moom Nam-soo (front, center), director of Environment Policy bureau in Gangwon Province, and Kim Kwi-gon (front, second from right), director of International Urban Training Center, pose with Vietnamese officials touring Korea to study the country’s low-income housing policy. (Gangwon Province) The program is designed for policymakers to exchange information, knowledge and experience in building affordable houses and financing them. Vietnamese officials are to bring insights from the trip to better plan their national housing strategy in need of reform to cater for the fast-growing population in urban areas. With an average increase in population of about 1 million people per year, Vietnam has been one of the most densely populated countries in the region and in the world. Population density in the capital of Hanoi reached nearly 1,900 people per square km in 2009 and that of Ho Chi Minh City is 3,400 people per square km. The Ministry of Construction is mandated to come up with better ways to provide decent social housing for the growing number of workers, migrants, students and disadvantaged groups. “I believe this (the study trip) will bring some insights for the policy makers, and support them to finalize the national housing development strategy for the next two decades,” Tran Xuan Bach, UN-HABITAT Vietnam project manager said.
