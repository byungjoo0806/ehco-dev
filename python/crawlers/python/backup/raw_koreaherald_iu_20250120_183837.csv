Korean Canadian singer faces lawsuit over alleged political activity as foreign national,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10402132,2025.01.19 14:44,"Musician says freedom of speech being suppressed Korean Canadian singer JK Kim Dong-uk, also known as John Kim, said via social media on Saturday that his freedom of speech is being violated, after an internet user filed a lawsuit accusing him of engaging in political activities as a foreign national. Kim has openly supported President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was formally arrested Sunday in connection to his declaration of martial law last month, and has called for the withdrawal of his impeachment, both online and offline. Under the Immigration Control Act, foreign nationals residing in South Korea are prohibited from participating in political activities unless otherwise permitted by law. Violators may face orders from the Ministry of Justice to cease political activities or even deportation, though such actions are rare. “This is the first time in my life I’ve been accused,” Kim wrote on social media. “Did I hold a large-scale rally on Jan. 3? That must be a mistake.” Kim has posted a photo of himself attending a rally in opposition to Yoon's arrest in front of the presidential residence in Hannam-dong, Seoul, on Jan. 3. “I’m curious when South Korea, a free nation, became a country that suppresses freedom of expression,” he added. On Friday, an internet user revealed on social platform X that JK Kim Dong-uk is expected to be accused of violating the prohibition on political activities by foreigners. “JK Kim Dong-uk, who renounced his Korean citizenship and acquired Canadian citizenship, is considered a foreign national. According to Article 17 of the Immigration Control Act, foreigners residing in Korea are prohibited from engaging in political activities, and violation could result in penalties,” the online commenter said. The commenter alleged that Kim repeatedly posted opposition to Yoon’s impeachment on his social media and said that the singer organized a large rally near the presidential residence on Jan. 3, sharing related content online. Kim, who was born in Seoul, immigrated to Canada in 1992 during his sophomore year of college. While his music career is based in South Korea, his Canadian citizenship exempted him from mandatory military service and denies him voting rights in the country. The singer has emerged as one of the most vocal supporters of Yoon in the entertainment industry, alongside singer Kim Heung-gook and actor Choi Joon-yong. JK Kim Dong-uk has consistently criticized calls for Yoon’s impeachment, stating on social media, “The Democratic Party lacks democracy, the judiciary lacks justice, and intellectuals lack knowledge.” After an initial temporary arrest warrant was issued for Yoon on Wednesday, Kim wrote, “The will of patriotic citizens defending freedom within the framework of the law in a constitutional state will resonate worldwide, standing in stark contrast to the pro-North Korea forces who have lost reason and disregard the law.” The controversy has drawn attention to another celebrity, IU, who has come under fire from far-right internet users for what they say is her political involvement. Last month, IU, who is a Korean citizen, prepaid for food and drinks at coffee shops near Yeouido in Seoul, the site of impeachment rallies against Yoon following his Dec. 3 martial law declaration. The food was distributed to rally attendees on a first-come, first-served basis. IU’s social media accounts have since been flooded with both criticism and support from users who are divided over her actions.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/news/cms/2025/01/19/news-p.v1.20250119.7966075d0f764f85839b60592f64a614_T1.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Pro-Yoon protesters target court that issued arrest warrant for president,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10401105,2025.01.17 11:04,"Supporters of President Yoon Suk Yeol are targeting Seoul Western District Court for issuing the warrant that enabled authorities to take Yoon into custody. The rallies that began Thursday night continued into Friday morning, with some forming a human blockade to stop the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials from delivering the application for the new warrant. Yoon is being detained on a 48-hour detention warrant that expires at 9:05 p.m. Friday. The CIO is widely expected to request sometime before Friday's deadline a warrant that would authorize him to be held for up to 20 days. The pro-Yoon protests were initially held in front of the court, but have since relocated to a nearby court due to police orders. Police at around 11 p.m. Thursday took into custody a protester in his 20s for obstruction of the performance of official duties after he attempted to close the gate of the court. The Seoul Western District Court has been targeted by avid followers of Yoon, who became the first South Korean president while still in office to be arrested Wednesday, since it issued the warrant for the president's arrest. The 64-year-old president is being held at the Seoul Detention Center for criminal investigation regarding insurrection and abuse of power charges related to his Dec. 3 declaration of martial law and the allegedly illegal orders that followed. The defiant Yoon has said that both the CIO's probe into him and the warrant for his arrest were illegal, a claim that was shot down by the Seoul Central District Court on Thursday. But the court decision does not appear to have dissuaded his followers, who have been carrying out protests and online attacks against those supporting Yoon's impeachment or the investigation into him. On the heels of Yoon's arrest Wednesday, a number of apparent Yoon supporters flooded the comment section of popular singer IU's social media, berating her for supporting demonstrations that called for the impeachment of the conservative president. An unidentified user of the online platform DC Inside, many users of which have far-right views, posted Thursday that he would ""behead"" the judge who deliberated on the Seoul Central District Court's aforementioned court review on legality of Yoon's arrest.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/news/cms/2025/01/17/news-a.v1.20250117.74f7e5174ca84f20aba4211eb49fc785_T1.png?type=h&h=240,iu

Huawei and IUCN Launch Tech4Nature Project to Protect Kenya's Coral Reefs,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10387930,2025.01.10 18:20,"NAIROBI, Kenya, Jan. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Huawei, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and local partner Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) have launched a Tech4Nature project to monitor and protect coral reef and biodiversity in Kenya's Kisite-Mpunguti Marine Park and Reserve. Aligned with Huawei's TECH4ALL initiative and the IUCN Green List, the objective of the three-year project is to strengthen monitoring and management efficacy of the protected area. Located on the southern coast of Kenya, Kisite-Mpunguti Marine Park and Reserve faces a number of nature conservation challenges. These include: ""Tech4Nature is an expansive project that falls under Huawei's digital inclusion initiative TECH4ALL, where we look at ways to implement technology and innovation in various sectors of our day today life and improving global standards and ensure that we have a sustainable way of life in the world,"" said Khadija Mohamed, Director of Media and Government Relations for Huawei Kenya. Underwater cameras, photogrammetry, and audio monitoring technologies will be deployed to monitor marine life, including the biomass and population of parrot fish. In many coral reef ecosystems, parrot fish are a keystone species that, due to their diet, help prevent coral from being smothered by seaweed and algae. The solution will also monitor substrate cover in the reef ecosystems, seagrass cover, and the occurrence of green turtles and bottlenose dolphins, which are classified on the IUCN Red List as endangered and vulnerable, respectively. ""The technology we are introducing is a groundbreaking development for marine conservation in Kenya. It will serve as the first monitoring tool for data collection, analysis, and management in a marine protected area. Additionally, this innovation presents an opportunity to assist the park in attaining IUCN Green List certification, aligning with the sustainability goals valued by tourists and ensuring that future generations can continue to benefit from our marine parks,"" said Innocent Kabenga, Country Representative for the IUCN Kenya Country Office. AI trained to recognize specific target species by sight or sound will provide real-time data-driven insights into the behaviors, populations, and distribution of biodiversity in the reserve and reef ecosystem. The system will also be able to identify boats used for illegal fishing, and send alerts for rangers to intervene in near real time. A digital power solution and improved network connectivity covering the park and watch tower will enable the rapid transmission of collected data to a cloud server for analysis by AI. The project will be implemented in partnership with Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and Wildlife Research and Training Institute (WRTI). Based on the project's data-driven insights, the Tech4Nature partners will be able to develop targeted conservation measures for the reserve. ""For us to deliver our mandate of protecting and conserving our wildlife in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, you have to understand your resources very well. We are partnering with Huawei and IUCN to deploy underwater cameras to acquire some data on marine mammal, corals, and fisheries to make informed decisions. The advantage of this technology it can be deployed in wider area that we couldn't patrol every single day to get data for day and night for us to make good, informed decisions,"" said Adan Kala, Senior Assistant Director, Coast Conservation Area, Kenya Wildlife Service. In addition, the project will include community outreach to raise awareness about biodiversity changes over time and the presence of different species, including those that are threatened, vulnerable, or endangered. The site will be assessed against the IUCN Green List Standard, with the goal being that the reserve obtains Green List certification. About Tech4Nature Huawei and IUCN launched the Tech4Nature global partnership in 2020 to scale up success in nature conservation through technological innovation.

The K-Brand Index, a big data evaluation system developed by the institute, uses a panel of experts for verification, from extracting candidate samples to selecting indices, ensuring reliability. This year’s artist category was determined by analyzing 5.64 billion online data points collected from Jan. 1 to Nov. 30. The evaluation included the top 30 solo artists and K-pop groups based on search volume from major portal sites. Lim secured first place in the rankings, followed by another trot singer Lee Chan-won in second, IU in third, Rose of Blackpink in fourth and Jang Won-young of Ive in fifth. Other notable mentions in the top 10 included Jennie of Blackpink, Jung Dong-won, Jimin of BTS, Ahn Yu-jin of Ive and Jungkook of BTS. The K-Brand Index calculates scores by integrating trends, media presence, social media activity, community engagement and sentiment analysis, excluding weight biases.

[What to play] Warm up your winter with tender melodies,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10032214,2024.12.28 16:00,"As sidewalks freeze over, tree branches grow bare, and delicate snowflakes drift through the air, winter's chill is here. Embrace the season by enjoying winter-themed songs that capture its quiet beauty while offering warmth through heartfelt melodies and lyrics. ""The Snowman"" by Jung Seung-hwan One of Korea's most beloved young ballad singers, Jung Seung-hwan, evokes images of a snow-covered landscape with the fairytale-like melody of “The Snowman.” Released on Feb. 19, 2018, as a pre-release track from his first full-length album “And Spring,” the song's music video features the serene snowy scenery of Hokkaido, Japan. Beginning with the gentle sound of bells and an acoustic guitar, the song builds layers of piano, electric guitar and synth, blending harmoniously with Jung's deeply emotional vocals. The poetic lyrics, from the perspective of a snowman watching the passing seasons, were written by IU. The sincere wish for another's happiness leaves a lasting impression: “Even if it takes time, please be sure to find happiness.” ""Walking in the Winter"" by Yun DDanDDan Singer-songwriter Yun DDanDDan, known for his clear, tender voice and relatable lyrics, captured the season's cold yet refreshing air in “Walking in the Winter.” ""Walking in the Winter"" is a B-side track from the singer's debut album “Fifty-Fifty,” released in 2014. This song's bittersweet lyrics about longing and regret for a past love contrast interestingly with its cheerful melodies and bright guitar. The lyrics vividly capture the narrator's raw emotions as he walks through the cold winter streets, reminiscing about a lost relationship. To celebrate the song's 10th anniversary, Yun recently went back to the original filming locations of the music video and recreated the shots for social media. ""Snowball"" by Bol4 Known for the purity of her voice, singer-songwriter Bol4, also known as Ahn Ji-young, captures the cozy atmosphere of winter in her song “Snowball.” Released on Dec. 12, 2023, as one of the two main tracks on the album “Merry Go Round,” the song was written and composed by Ahn herself. While Bol4 has often sung about the warmth and freshness of spring and summer, “Snowball” marks her first winter-themed song. The music video beautifully showcases the snowy landscapes of Sapporo, Japan. Introducing the song, Ahn explained, “I hate using clear themes like seasons, weather and places in vague, ambiguous ways. That’s why it took a lot of courage for me to take on 'winter' this time,” emphasizing the song's significance and the warmth it exudes.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/news/cms/2024/12/27/news-p.v1.20241224.0ab1d9d757124482b6d2cd1d0580d938_T1.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Fake news about US banning anti-Yoon ralliers resurfaces online,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10021683,2024.12.23 17:38,"False rumors and unconfirmed reports are spreading online about the US government’s supposed crackdown on anyone who has openly criticized the now-impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol. Online communities, particularly those frequently by far-right supporters of the besieged leader, are sharing a debunked fake news report from 2018 about the US Central Intelligence Agency’s plans to permanently ban from entry anyone who has been reported to be anti-American or participated in an anti-American protest. It also claimed that those reported to be anti-American will also be banned from sending their children to the US for education. The US Embassy in Korea at the time confirmed the report to be false, telling local broadcaster JTBC it was ""not worth responding to."" Curiously, this debunked fake news story has resurfaced in Korea, amid the tumultuous events following Yoon’s ill-fated declaration of martial law on Dec. 3 and his subsequent impeachment. This has polarized public opinion into two camps: a majority condemning Yoon and a minority going all out to defend him. Yoon is currently undergoing a criminal investigation on charges of insurrection and abuse of power while also being subject to an impeachment trial. He declared martial law on Dec. 3 and is suspected of ordering the arrest of prominent political figures and civilians, many of whom have publicly spoken against him. On the diplomatic front, Yoon, a conservative, has maintained a pro-American stance and supports friendly ties with Japan. His supporters often accuse opponents of being anti-American and pro-North Korean. Some online platforms with far-right political views have also been publishing unconfirmed claims about supposed actions by the US government. For instance, a website known for unsourced and unverified far-right conspiracy theories recently claimed that Washington has issued a warning against ""leftwing professors who thoughtlessly expressed political views and decried the political situation without context,"" in a clear reference to scholars who openly condemned Yoon’s martial law imposition. The claim cites no statements sources from the Korean or US governments, but instead references anonymous comments on local online communities. The website's unverified claims also include the supposed rigging of parliamentary elections, which was alleged by the president but dismissed by a police investigation as baseless. In the aftermath of the anti-Yoon protests, several members of online communities with pro-conservative political inclinations were found to be encouraging each other to report celebrities like IU to the CIA. The celebrities in question had publicly expressed support for demonstrations against Yoon. They claimed that just reporting the celebrities to the CIA as spies would lead to a criminal investigation, which would hinder them from activities in the US or even entering the country. A person claiming to be a supporter of the president's People Power Party said he or she has filed a similar report against Daegu Mayor Hong Joon-pyo, citing exhaustion with Hong's talk about an early presidential election in case Yoon's impeachment is confirmed and he is removed from office. The CIA collects and analyzes foreign intelligence and conducts covert actions, but is not the government body authorized to grant entry to the US. According to the US government, the Department of Homeland Security and officials with the US Customs and Border Protection agency at the port-of-entry have the authority to permit entry into the US. The US State Department can impose visa restrictions on individuals under Section 212 (a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and National Act. The particular section of the law stipulates the possibility of visa restrictions on numerous grounds, such as involvement in the misuse of commercial hardware to target or unlawfully surveil, harass, suppress or intimidate individuals, but expressing one's political inclination is not among them.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/news/cms/2024/12/23/news-p.v1.20241223.be246a2a1a17461192eadd1c587d3c99_T1.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

The top choices were TV personality Yoo Jae-suk and K-pop singer IU. Among the male celebrities considered, Yoo Jae-suk received 23 percent support from the surveyed 2,507 job seekers belonging to Generation Z, defined for this purpose as those born between 1997 and 2006. In the female leader category, IU emerged as the top choice, garnering 21 percent, according to the survey conducted by online recruiting firm Catch. For Both Yoo and IU, their thoughtfulness and kindness were cited as key reasons for their selection. Male entertainer Dex received 18 percent of the vote, with respondents giving his empathy and kindness as significant attributes. Female dancer Gabee earned 19 percent of the vote to rank as the second most popular leader after IU. In response to the poll results, Kim Jeong-hyun, a director at Catch, said, ""Gen Z views communication and kindness as critical traits in a leader.

"Ripple effects of Yoon Suk Yeol’s impeachment: Celebrities, businesses caught in crossfire",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10020363,2024.12.20 17:16,"The political upheaval surrounding the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol has extended beyond the National Assembly, targeting celebrities and businesses. Social media campaigns and boycotts have intensified, channeling public outrage in one of the world‘s most connected nations. Singer IU, a K-pop singer and actor, has become a target of criticism from opponents of Yoon’s impeachment. Her voluntary gesture of prepaying for food and hand warmers to support participants at a rally advocating for Yoon‘s impeachment has drawn significant criticism. Reports suggest that IU, along with other public figures, has been added to a “blacklist” allegedly compiled by Yoon’s supporters. The “Yoon Suk Yeol Impeachment Support List” began circulating online last week, including IU and other celebrities, such as girl group NewJeans, filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, comedian Park Myung-soo and actor Go Ah-sung. At the bottom of the image, it encourages reporting these individuals to the US Central Intelligence Agency, based on the spurious claim that being reported would prevent them from entering the United States. One online user even posted a screenshot claiming to have reported IU to the CIA, urging others to participate in a “verification relay” by submitting similar reports. The post, originally shared on the “People Power Party Gallery” of online forum DCInside, has since been deleted. Critics have dismissed the campaign as an embarrassing and absurd overreaction, with one commenter stating, “I don’t understand why people are resorting to such actions.” Additionally, calls for boycotts against companies associated with IU have intensified. Lists of brands she has endorsement deals with, including Woori Bank and Hite Jinro, are being shared online with suggestions to stop buying products or services from the businesses. On the other side, those supporting Yoon’s impeachment have launched a boycott against Purmil, a dairy company owned by the family of Rep. Yoon Sang-hyun’s wife. Yoon Sang-hyun, a vocal opponent of the impeachment motion, has faced significant backlash. Critics accuse him and his family’s company of being complicit in insurrection, aligning their boycott with their broader political grievances. Rep. Yoon, married to Shin Kyung-ah, a member of the family behind Purmil, has consistently opposed Yoon‘s impeachment. On the day of the vote, he reaffirmed his stance, stating, “We cannot hand over power to the reckless Democratic Party led by Lee Jae-myung.” His comments further fueled the campaign against Purmil. Observers note that South Korea’s tendency to channel public sentiment into collective action has been magnified by social media. What begins as localized outrage can quickly escalate into nationwide campaigns, often fueled by misinformation, as seen with the CIA reporting claims, they said. “Social media accelerates these dynamics,” said Choi Jong-ryul, a sociology professor at Keimyung University. “Outrage is no longer confined to political spheres -- it extends into cultural and economic realms, creating ripples that impact individuals and businesses alike.” As South Korea grapples with the ramifications of Yoon Suk Yeol’s impeachment, the controversy’s reach to celebrities and businesses underscores the pervasive nature of political division, he added.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/news/cms/2024/12/20/news-p.v1.20241220.7c77693f59dc402d8f7f89f0ce370f6d_T1.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

The anonymous users have posted screenshots of their reports to the US federal agency that collects and analyzes foreign intelligence. ""IU can't go to America now,"" read the title of an anonymous post on DC Inside, with the writer accusing the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea of being ""secretly backed by China"" and claimed IU was ""actively supporting communist forces."" The users on the controversial website encouraged others to follow suit, sharing a list of celebrities that publicly supported Yoon's impeachment. Some of them said that reporting the celebrities as spies would trigger investigations, making it difficult for them to visit or work in the US. They have also called for a boycott of products sold by companies endorsed by IU and other celebrities, sharing a list of the brands. IU, one of Korea's most influential pop stars, recently provided prepaid meals and snacks to people taking part in the protests against the president. President Yoon currently faces an impeachment trial and criminal investigation on charges of insurrection for his declaration of martial law on Dec. 3, which marked the first time in over 40 years that martial law has been declared in the country. It was revealed by military commanders and government officials that Yoon ordered the arrests of prominent political figures and his outspoken critics. He also sent troops to the National Assembly and the National Election Commission, with the latter possibly linked to his claim that the past two parliamentary elections -- which Yoon's party lost -- were ""rigged.""",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/12/17/20241217050080_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
A Commendable Bird Rescue Action,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10019047,2024.12.16 20:10,"BEIJING, Dec. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The sand martin, known as the 'bank swallow', inhabits open country near water, including riverbanks, lakeshores, and coastal cliffs. So, it is also called 'natural water quality inspector'. The sand martin has been assessed for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 2016 and is listed as the second-class protected wildlife in Beijing. China Matters produced an animated feature titled A Commendable Bird Rescue Action to tell heartwarming story of bird protection In the Daxing section of the Yongding River in Beijing, there is a nearly vertical earth slope that rises about 20 meters high and stretches 30 to 40 meters wide from north to south. Nearly 200 bowl-sized holes – the nests of sand martins – are built in the vertical face of the slope. From every May to July, flocks of sand martins fly here to nest and breed, making the slope the largest habitat that has been ever known in Beijing. In June, 2024, a river control project was proceeded to the slope on which nearly a thousand sand martins nest. What would happen next? To protect these birds, bird conservationists, the construction team of the project, local authorities, and wildlife protection organizations made a quick response and joined hands in collaboration. Within only seven hours, they reached a consensus that the construction work will be suspended permanently and this area will become a conservation area for sand martins. Furthermore, local authorities will work to raise the awareness of protection of wildlife, such as listing the sand martin as a distinctive species of bird in Daxing District, building wildlife educational base and birdwatching sites, and promoting knowledge of wildlife conservation to more people. To tell this heartwarming story of bird protection, China Matters produced an animated feature titled A Commendable Bird Rescue Action. The animation vividly depicts the entire process of all parties working in unison to rescue sand martins at a critical moment. The rescue effort highlights the power of cooperation between various groups of society and underscores the significance of maintaining harmony between humanity and nature. https://youtu.be/Xx1uiHtDf6c",,iu
K-pop star IU supplies hot food for fans attending anti-Yoon rallies,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10017103,2024.12.14 12:33,"K-pop superstar IU has arranged for hot food and drinks, as well as hot packs, to be provided to people attending a rally calling for the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol, her agency said Friday. Edam Entertainment, in an official fan cafe post, said the singer wanted to provide warmth to ""Uena,"" or IU fans, who would be attending the protests in the cold weather. ""We hope that the hands of Uaena, who brighten the surroundings, will be a little warmer,” the post reads. The food provided by IU includes 100 portions of bread, 100 drinks, 100 bowls of soup, 100 bowls of beef bone soup, and 100 portions of rice cakes. The agency also mentioned that anyone, even if they are not officially registered members of the fan club, could receive the food and hot packs on a first-come, first-served basis at the rallies. Young protesters are taking to the streets with light sticks, singing K-pop songs to express their anger at President Yoon, who imposed martial law last week in a high-stakes gambit to reverse his struggling political fortunes. South Korea’s parliament is set to vote on his impeachment at 4 p.m. Saturday. IU, whose real name is Lee Ji-eun, is also an actress known for her roles in various TV and film productions, including “My Mister.”",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/12/14/20241214050004_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
ROYAL COMMISSION FOR ALULA'S ARABIAN LEOPARD CONSERVATION PROGRAMME WELCOMES BIRTH OF RARE TRIPLETS,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10012432,2024.12.05 00:10,"A first for KSA, the triplets – two male and one female and a litter of two cubs – male and female – born earlier this summer ALULA, Saudi Arabia, Dec. 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) has announced the birth of a rare litter of three Arabian leopard cubs – one male and two female – marking a major milestone in efforts to safeguard the future of this critically endangered subspecies of big cats. The triplets were born at RCU's Arabian Leopard Conservation Breeding Centre this summer. The first time three cubs have been born together in captivity in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the youngsters are being closely observed by the centre's expert team who are recording their behaviour and interactions. Carefully observed via CCTV so as not to disturb them, the cubs are already displaying distinctive personalities, with the two males proving to be particularly boisterous, climbing rocks in their enclosure and play fighting with each other. The female, on the other hand, is much shyer and more attached to their mother. While records from past decades are imperfect, this is believed to be only the third litter of Arabian leopard triplets born in captivity in roughly the past 30 years, and the first in Saudi Arabia. Currently the Arabian Leopard Conservation Breeding Centre is the world's most successful site for the conservation breeding of Arabian leopards. Each of the triplets have received their first vaccinations and health checks, which allowed staff to confirm their sexes. Despite their young age, individual social behaviours are emerging between the cubs, with the males described by staff as ""naughty, rough-and-tumble"" while the female is ""sweet and attentive"". This dynamic between siblings is essential for the cubs' wellbeing, welfare, and behaviour. From a very young age, a hierarchy will be established with the cubs learning how to co-exist with each other as they get older. They will spend around 18 months their mother. The centre has enjoyed something of a baby boom recently, with the triplets' arrival coming less than a month after twin cubs were born on earlier in the year. The twins, one male and one female, are both attached to each other and to their mother, following her everywhere. They are growing and getting braver, spending the majority of their time hiding between rocks and playing together. The births show the continued progress of RCU's vital work to restore the Arabian Leopard population, which the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has classified as critically endangered since 1996, with roughly 100 estimated to remain in the wild. RCU's centre, welcomed seven births last year and five so far this year. There are now 32 leopards at the centre – more than double the original 14 when RCU took over the project in 2020. Dr. Stephen Browne, VP of Wildlife and Natural Heritage, RCU said: ""The Arabian leopard is a powerful symbol of our vision to conserve AlUla's natural environment through a conservation programme that is restoring nature's balance. RCU is committed to preparing leopards born at the centre for release into the wild, ensuring they have minimum human contact and are fully equipped for reintroduction. These efforts will ultimately lead to Arabian leopards once again roaming free in AlUla's protected nature reserves.""

Huawei's TECH4ALL Initiative Expands Role in Europe's Green and Digital Transformation,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10011315,2024.11.20 20:20,"PARIS, Nov. 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Huawei and key TECH4ALL partners showcased the growing role of Huawei's TECH4ALL initiative in Europe's digital and green transformation at Huawei Connect Paris 2024. The TECH4ALL Forum on day one of Huawei Connect explored several new and existing TECH4ALL projects and the value these are creating in driving sustainable development for the benefit of both people and the planet. ""We believe that technology and partnerships are at the heart of digital and green transformation and are central to building an inclusive and sustainable digital world,"" said Jeffrey Zhou, President of ICT Marketing at Huawei. ""That is the thinking behind our TECH4ALL initiative, which we launched five years ago in 2019 and which today is stronger than ever."" At the event, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) introduced the Tech4Nature global partnership, which Huawei and IUCN jointly launched in 2020 to scale up success in nature conservation through technological innovation. Aligned with Huawei's TECH4ALL initiative and the IUCN Green List, Tech4Nature has supported 11 flagship projects in eight countries with tailored solutions to conservation challenges. ""Tech4Nature is a global partnership between the nature conservation sector led by IUCN and the tech sector led by Huawei. It's a crucially important partnership because technology needs to be part of the solution to the biodiversity and climate crises facing the planet. Tech4Nature is about tapping into the innovation and energy of the tech sector to help solve these issues,"" said James Hardcastle, Global Protected and Conserved Areas Director for IUCN. Phase II of Tech4Nature kicked off in 2024 with new projects launched or scheduled in five countries, including a biodiversity monitoring and protection project in Spain's Sierra Nevada, which was launched last week. The Greek startup PROBOTEK introduced the new forest fire prevention and response system developed under the TECH4ALL initiative. Working with the Greece government, project partners PROBOTEK, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, and Huawei selected Skiathos in October 2024 as a pilot site for Phase II of the solution. Comprising sensors, 5G, AI, and drones, the solution is expected to mitigate the potential devastation caused by forest fires by enabling an emergency response within the first 'golden 15 minutes' of detection, sending evacuation routes to residents' phones, and planning routes for fire trucks and ambulances. In the area of education, UNESCO has partnered with Huawei TECH4ALL on the Open School initiative and UNESCO Campus. At the TECH4ALL Forum, UNESCO presented its strategies for boosting education equity and quality on a global scale. ""UNESCO's STEM strategy aims to amplify the efforts of the UNESCO Member States in promoting STEM education by building a robust ecosystem that supports the development of critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and innovation. It emphasizes a number of actions, including increasing youth engagement in STEM fields, improving teacher capacities, and promoting gender equality and inclusion,"" said Magdalena Landry, Director of the UNESCO Regional Bureau for Science and Culture in Europe.

Indianapolis Zoo Awards $1 Million to Save Critically Endangered Blue-Throated Hillstar,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3832040,2024.10.26 00:20,"Newly discovered hummingbird on brink of extinction INDIANAPOLIS, Oct. 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Indianapolis Zoo has awarded a $1 million grant to the Ecuadorian conservation group Fundación Jocotoco to save a newly-discovered hummingbird from the brink of extinction. The Indianapolis Zoo created the $1 million Saving Species Challenge with the specific goal of saving a single species from extinction. The plan to save the Blue-Throated Hillstar was chosen by a jury of international animal conservation experts. In total, 52 applications were received from 46 countries. ""We are witnessing a global decline in biodiversity, and the Indianapolis Zoo is determined to make a positive difference. We are honored to support the work of Fundación Jocotoco, and I am confident the Blue-Throated Hillstar can be saved,"" said Dr. Robert Shumaker, Indianapolis Zoo President & CEO. The Blue-Throated Hillstar, a new hummingbird species, was discovered in 2017. The Hillstar is found within only 24 square miles of a cold, high-elevation area of the isolated Chillan Mountain range in Southwestern Ecuador. Habitat loss due to mining and frequent burning is responsible for the bird's classification as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Today, fewer than 110 adult birds remain. Soon after the Blue-Throated Hillstar was discovered, Fundación Jocotoco created the Cerro de Arcos Reserve to protect its habitat. The group will use the $1 million grant to work closely with local communities to expand protected land to ensure the bird's survival. ""We know we can succeed because we've done it before—like saving the critically endangered Pale-Headed Brushfinch. Once reduced to just 50 individuals, Jocotoco protected the brushfinch's last habitat, and the population quickly increased fivefold."" said Dr. Martin Schaefer, CEO of Jocotoco. The Saving Species Challenge was developed with the intent to reverse the decline of a single species that is currently designated as threatened on the IUCN Red List. Fundación Jocotoco will have five years to implement their plan and improve the Red List status of the Blue-Throated Hillstar. Click here for free-use media assets.

First Saudi Protected Area Listed on IUCN Green List,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3495618,2024.10.17 00:30,"Ibex Reserve, just south of Riyadh, joins global gold standard for protected and conserved areas. RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Oct. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Saudi National Center for Wildlife (NCW) is announcing that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has included the Ibex Reserve in its exclusive Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas. The Ibex Reserve, which is managed by the NCW, becomes the first reserve in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to meet all the required criteria and indicators to join the list, which includes less than 80 reserves out of over 300,000 protected areas worldwide. The IUCN Green List inclusion represents a global acknowledgment by independent experts of the efficacy of Ibex Reserve's management programs and reflects the reserve's success in meeting the Green List's key criteria, which includes effective governance, transparency and accountability, management based on best available scientific expertise and local knowledge, consideration of social and economic context, and proactive planning. ""The Ibex Reserve's Green List status not only enhances its international standing but also drives forward our broader conservation and sustainable development initiatives. We are actively collaborating with our wildlife sector partners to bring all our national reserves up to this international standard,"" said Dr. Mohammed Qurban, CEO, National Center for Wildlife. The National Center for Wildlife currently manages 11 protected areas across Saudi Arabia. Since 2017, NCW has supported the expansion of Saudi Arabia's marine protected areas from 3.6 percent to 6.5 percent and its terrestrial protected areas from 4.5 percent to 18.1 percent — and the Kingdom is on track to reach the 30x30 goal enshrined in the UN's Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. Situated in the Tuwaiq mountain range in central Saudi Arabia, the Ibex Reserve was established in 1988 at the request of local communities to safeguard a herd of ibex, a threatened species. As a result of NCW's dedicated efforts, the ibex population has significantly rebounded. NCW collaborates with local communities surrounding the Reserve and across the Kingdom to promote sustainable development, ecotourism, scientific research, and heritage preservation. The Ibex Reserve also provides a habitat for other vulnerable species including rock hyraxes, foxes, birds, and reptiles, and contains diverse vegetation including acacia trees, shrubs, herbs, and grasses.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/news/cms/2024/10/17/20241017050003.bfde3ac1-2a39-48c9-85d8-6ba043a2de56_T1.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Rejects Petition to List Long-Tailed Macaques Under the Endangered Species Act,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3489289,2024.10.08 05:10,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- On October 7, 2024, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (""USFWS"" or ""the Service"") declined to accept a petition filed by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and other advocacy groups to list long-tailed macaque (""LTM"") monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) under the Endangered Species Act (""ESA""). The decision caps a review by USFWS in which the Service found the petition did not present credible information to support impacts to LTM populations or the species as a whole due to potential threats, either separately or cumulatively, such that the species may warrant listing. Long-tailed macaques are used extensively throughout the world in biomedical research given their close approximation to human beings. Six of the 25 most used prescription drugs were developed with the help of long-tailed macaques.1 Research with long-tailed macaques has been crucial for advances in regenerative medicine,2 immunology,3 cancer,4 vaccine development,5 and pharmacology.6 The National Institutes for Health (NIH) recently published a review confirming the importance of LTMs in conducting biomedical research. The USFWS decision follows a recent decision by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s decision to reconsider the ""Endangered"" designation of LTM in response to a petition from the National Association for Biomedical Research (NABR) challenging the listing decision by IUCN.7 The IUCN directed authors that had conducted a status review (Hansen et al. 2022) to reevaluate their assessment to address scientific issues raised by NABR in its petition. NABR's petition showed the 2022 review by Hansen et. al., which the IUCN used as the basis for its decision to uplist the long-tailed macaque's status, misrepresented existing scientific data. A separate petition filed by Dr. Hank Jenkins, which remains pending before the IUCN, asserts that the Hansen et al. (2022) authors possess conflicts of interest that require further investigation by the IUCN. ""NABR is pleased that the USFWS has declined to accept the petition filed by PETA and other advocacy groups based upon its consideration of the best available scientific information,"" said Matthew R. Bailey, president of NABR. ""Available scientific information clearly shows that this species is not at risk and does not warrant a further status review. NABR looks forward to working with USFWS to ensure the integrity of its scientific processes."" The conservation status of long-tailed macaque and PETA's involvement in government programs was recently the subject of a U.S. House of Representatives Oversight Committee hearing in September 2024. Witnesses at this hearing testified that PETA and other animal advocacy groups had improperly attempted to influence government investigations of private parties and foreign governments for political reasons.

[Herald Review] 2NE1 returns better than ever,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3488719,2024.10.07 16:01,"“Come Back Home” echoed through the Olympic Hall in Olympic Park, Seoul, on Sunday evening, sparking ecstatic cheers from fans as all four members of the iconic K-pop girl group 2NE1 took to the stage for their first concert in over a decade. The group, comprising Sandara Park, CL, Park Bom and Minzy, dazzled in their signature eclectic outfits that have long defined their unique style. CL sported a striking red jacket with a large red ribbon, while Sandara Park showcased a bold bolero with exaggerated shoulders. Kicking off ""Welcome Back,"" the last of their three concerts -- “Come Back Home” and “Fire” were the other two -- many devoted members of the group's fandom, known as Blackjacks, were moved to tears. “It’s been a long while, Blackjacks! Shout out ‘Let’s play’ if you’re ready for the next song,” said Sandara Park, encouraging the crowd. The proximity of the main stage to the audience amplified the concert's immersive atmosphere. Despite the years apart, the quartet delivered a powerful performance, revisiting classic hits like “Can’t Nobody,” “Falling In Love” and “I Don’t Care.” The choreography was vigorous, demanding much more energy than the routines of some of today's K-pop girl groups. The youngest member Minzy, who in the past was somewhat overshadowed by other members' talents, seemed to have blossomed with vocals and dancing that truly stood out. Following the first segment of the concert, video tributes from major K-pop artists — including IU, NewJeans, Ive, Twice, aespa and Stray Kids — played on screens, celebrating 2NE1's 15th anniversary concert. CL then captivated the audience with solo performances of “The Baddest Female” and “MTBD,” commanding the stage in a long white fur robe before dramatically tossing it aside. In the next segment, 2NE1 donned black outfits to perform heartfelt ballads, including “Missing You,” “It Hurts,” “If I Were You” and “Lonely.” A nostalgic video montage showcased 2NE1's trainee days, working hard to become K-pop idols in 2008, alongside their journey as a group since their 2009 debut. The concert reached its zenith with the explosive performance of their hit number “I Am the Best.” The audience erupted in excitement, dancing and singing along, while the members made their way through the crowd, connecting with fans up close. “This venue is significant to us as we held our first concert here. It’s also special to celebrate our 15th anniversary together as a group,” Sandara Park said. Park Bom added, “We are incredibly thankful for all the love and support (we received) while preparing for this concert. We are overjoyed to finally perform for you.” “I know it must have felt like an endless wait, but thank you for your patience. Meeting you for the first time in 10 years brings back wonderful memories,” Sandara Park continued. “We aimed to evoke nostalgia with this concert, showcasing what a classic 2NE1 show looks like. We felt so much positive energy from all of you, and we hope you felt it too,” CL said. Sandara Park hinted at future plans, saying, “Initially, we planned a one-day concert, but tickets sold out so quickly that we added two more days. Shouldn’t we consider an encore concert? We’ll try to book a larger venue for that!” 2NE1 is now set to embark on a tour across Asia, with 15 concerts planned in nine cities, starting with a show in Manila scheduled for Nov. 16.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/10/07/20241007050606_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
"Korean bands get their day in the sun, finally",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3853122,2024.10.04 22:29,"Bands are dominating local charts at the moment, led by JYP Entertainment's pop-rock sensation Day6. With four of their old and new tracks among the top 10 on Melon’s music chart as of Friday -- “Happy” and “Welcome to the Show” claiming the No. 1 and No. 3 spots and “Melt Down” and “Time of Our Life” holding strong at No. 4 and No. 6, respectively -- it’s clear the Korean music scene is in the midst of a band craze. Day6 is no newcomer. But it is only now that it has reached this level, nine years since its debut in 2015. While Day6 has long been favored by local music enthusiasts, this is the first time it has achieved such broad mainstream appeal. Among all-female bands, four-member project band QWER is leading the rock genre. “My Name is Malgeum” from the band's second EP, “Algorithm’s Blossom,” which released Sept. 23, currently ranks No. 2 on the Melon chart, the higher than any K-pop girl group. This places QWER above aespa’s hit “Supernova” at No. 4 and NewJeans’ “How Sweet” at No. 8. The main reason for the surge in the popularity of such bands seems to be growing fatigue with the high-octane, addictive hooks typical of K-pop idol groups. In contrast, the music of such bands is considered easier to listen to. “The currently popular band music follows traditional melodic structures that allow listeners to naturally feel the emotional contours throughout the song. It’s a familiar pattern that has long been recognized for evoking pleasure,” said music critic Lim Hee-yun. Day6, for example, employs familiar, catchy melodies and combines them with universally relatable lyrics. “Time of Our Life,” for example, offers encouragement to young people, with lines such as, “Let’s write a beautiful chapter of our youth together.” “Day6’s songs don’t convey aggressive messages or complex themes. Rather, they resonate as anthems for a weary generation,” said music critic Kim Do-heon. “With the members actively involved in writing and composing their songs, they’re gaining even more love for their authenticity.” Japanese subculture and anime content have also influenced the rise in popularity of bands in Korea. Local bands often feature arrangements and melodies similar to Japanese rock bands that create anime soundtracks. “The popularity of Japanese anime films like ‘The First Slam Dunk’ and ‘Suzume’ seems to have influenced Korean bands' music. The youthful passion and energy in these films, combined with their unique, refreshing imagery, often accompanied by rock music, have contributed to this trend,” Lim added. “As Japanese content continues to gain traction among younger generations, there’s a growing preference for Japanese-style rock and melodies.” It’s not only K-pop bands that are gaining recognition — indie bands are also experiencing a surge in popularity. Local indie rock band Silica Gel sold out three concerts at Jangchung Gymnasium in Seoul in May, a feat rarely achieved even by popular K-pop groups. Notably, Silica Gel has become a band to reckon with based on its music alone; the band does not appear on TV shows, which has often been the fastest path to stardom for underground musicians. Another indie band, Wave to Earth, currently boasts over 8.19 million monthly listeners on Spotify, a figure that is 1.5 times higher than IU’s 5.3 million, as of Thursday. IU is one of the most successful female K-pop solo artists today. “Short-form videos on social media have helped indie musicians in the band scene gain immense popularity. The fan base for niche band music has snowballed as content is shared among enthusiasts who appreciate less mainstream sounds,” Lim said.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/10/03/20241003050229_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

With infrastructure development set to surge, driven by population and economic growth, the Nature Risk Tool will combat a reality that infrastructure development often leads to habitat loss, biodiversity decline, pollution, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. Over the past 50 years, wildlife populations have decreased by an average of 60%[1], with infrastructure development being a significant factor. Powered by AECOM, and using datasets from the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), the SMI Nature Risk Tool enables infrastructure investors and promoters to analyse any piece of land globally (at a scale of metres), providing expert-reviewed descriptions of the location's habitat and biomes early in the site selection process. The Nature Risk Tool then evaluates a project's impact on the environment and suggests mitigation strategies, offering potential solutions or environmental protection measures. This information can be used to inform planner and policymaker decisions on creating infrastructure that promotes sustainable development and protects the natural environment. Importantly, the tool also aligns with the TNFD framework, enabling users to utilise the data for the TNFD LEAP process. For example, if a protected species is found by the tool on the proposed site, early identification during the site selection phase allows for either ruling out that site or integrating protective measures into the development process to ensure the species' continued protection. The tool also aligns with the TNDF framework, enabling users to utilise the data for the TNFD LEAP process. Jennifer Jordan Saifi, CEO, Sustainable Markets Initiative, said: ""Nature is the engine of our economy, which is why it lies at the heart of our mandate, the Terra Carta. It is central to providing us with solutions for a sustainable future. ""Partnering with AECOM, we have been able to demonstrate the significant impact that infrastructure development can have on global biodiversity. ""This is why I am proud to be launching the SMI Nature Risk Tool, something we hope will have many use cases and that will act as a powerful resource for developers and policymakers worldwide as we work collectively to protect and restore harmony with Nature."" Troy Rudd, Chief Executive Officer and Head of the Measurement and Transparency Task Force, AECOM, added: ""We are incredibly excited about this partnership with the Sustainable Market Initiative. By combining our expertise in infrastructure consulting with SMI's commitment to sustainability, we are setting a new standard for how projects can be planned and executed with nature and biodiversity at the forefront. ""This collaboration not only enhances our ability to deliver innovative solutions but also underscores our shared vision for a more sustainable and resilient future."" The tool will be employed at the project initiation stage to support site selection and feasibility studies, enhance decision-making and efficiency, and significantly minimise impacts on nature and biodiversity. By bringing the tool in at an early stage, it will provide critical insights into project risks at key decision-making milestones, allowing leaders and planners to pivot and mitigate risks before a project is underway.

[Herald Review] IU wraps up 1st world tour 'HEREH' at Seoul World Cup Stadium,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3479672,2024.09.23 14:18,"K-pop sensation IU wrapped up her first world tour, ‘HEREH,’ with an unforgettable finale Sunday at the Seoul World Cup Stadium. She made a striking entrance on a swing-like lift, dressed in a sparkling coral mini dress and a white headset, kicking off the show with “Holssi,” the first track from a captivating setlist that spanned over two hours. IU took an audience of 50,000 on a mesmerizing journey, performing “Ah Puh” amidst a stunning display of whale and jellyfish-shaped lanterns carried by dancers. While the open-air venue posed some challenges with sound delays that slightly detracted from the immersive experience, IU skillfully countered this with a variety of creative props and stage effects. The second section of the show began with a little girl awakening onstage, setting the scene for a magical moment when a star, carried by a drone, guided her to IU, who reappeared on the swing lift adorned with colorful flowers to sing “Celebrity.” She then flew over the venue to the stage front, where her fans, donning blue flower headpieces, surprised her during “Blueming.” “It’s wonderful to see you up close. Your affectionate gazes fill my heart with love. Thank you for this surprise event. I included this song just for this encore show,” IU said. She expressed her desire to perform “I Stan U” surrounded by her audience, adding, “Thank you for starting your autumn with my concert. Just as you cheer for me, I hope to be that kind of audience for you as well.” During the concert, IU also debuted a new song, “Bye Summer,” showcasing her skills on a crystal blue electric guitar. “This tour felt like summer lasted forever. However, I want to say it’s been the best summer because I shared it with all of you. This song feels fitting for a day that marks the end of summer,” she explained. The concert peaked with 1,000 drones illuminating the night sky during “Last Fantasy.” Dressed like a fairy tale princess wearing a flowing white gown and a crown, IU created a magical atmosphere enhanced by fireworks. A giant Tweety balloon, reminiscent of her “Shopper” music video, floated above as she performed the lead track from her latest EP ""The Winning."" As the concert drew to a close, IU reflected on the emotional weight of the moment. “This is the last moment of my world tour, and it makes me feel so sentimental. I hope you achieve victories, big and small, until we meet again,” she said, transitioning to “Love Wins All,” the final song on her setlist. Accompanied by an orchestra and a choir, her soulful performance left the audience mesmerized, inspiring clapping atypical of K-pop concerts. Sunday's show was also her 100th concert. “It feels surreal that today’s final show of my first world tour is also my 100th concert. I was surprised a fan was counting all my concerts — something even my parents don’t do. This world tour was possible because of your love and support. I promise to return with more great music,” she concluded.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/09/23/20240923050500_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
'Keep IU off the grass': Soccer fans oppose K-pop concerts at World Cup Stadium,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3474909,2024.09.17 16:00,"National soccer team captain Son Heung-min's comment over grass conditions leads to complaints about K-pop concerts at stadium From Madison Square Garden in New York to Wembley Stadium in London, the biggest sports arenas and stadiums in major cities often double as concert venues. But holding concerts at Seoul World Cup Stadium is being challenged by some soccer fans complaining that nonsports events there have crucial detrimental effects on the field. A self-proclaimed fan of Son Heung-min on Sept. 11 posted a petition on the state-run e-People website, calling for the cancellation of the K-pop superstar IU's concert slated for Sept. 21-22 in Seoul World Cup Stadium in Sangam-dong, Seoul. The petitioner claimed that the large crowd expected for the concert -- which sold out 100,000 tickets within minutes -- will damage the grass of the stadium that will be used for the qualifying matches of the upcoming 2026 World Cup. After playing Palestine on its home field on Sept. 5, South Korea will host the rest of its Group B opponents in the qualifiers slated until next year. But there have been multiple complaints from players, fans and even opposing teams about the poor conditions of the grass. ""A third-round qualifying match between South Korea and Iraq is slated in Sangam on Oct. 15, and (the authorities) should try their best to manage the grass there for remainder of (the World Cup qualifiers) period,"" the petitioner wrote. The person cited Seoul Metropolitan Government's Ordinance on the Installation and Operation of Seoul Sports Facilities, which in Article 5-3 states that the mayor may bar or even cancel use of a sports facility if they deem an event as possibly causing a hindrance to the management of the facility in question. Grass greener on other side The controversy started when national team captain Son-- who led his team's 3-1 road win over Oman with a go-ahead goal in the second half -- complained about the grass in the Seoul World Cup Stadium. He said the Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex's field being in good condition allowed him to play with more confidence, adding that he wishes such good management could be applied to Korea's home fields as well. After his team ended in a goalless draw against Palestine in Seoul, he claimed the grass had made things difficult for him to control the ball. The allegedly questionable grass conditions at the Seoul World Cup Stadium have long been an issue here. Former national team player Ki Sung-yueng in 2017 jokingly said that he was not worried about a road match in China, because the grass there ""could not possibly be worse than in Seoul."" In light of the concerns over grass, Seoul Facilities Corporation in October 2021 installed new turf comprised of 95 percent natural and 5 percent synthetic grass. Fewer events were held at the stadium since then compared to before, with the venue being concert-free for a full year since the new field was installed. But between the ongoing remodeling of the Seoul Olympic Main Stadium in Jamsil, southern Seoul and the Gocheok Sky Dome being occupied for the professional baseball league season, the World Cup Stadium has become virtually the only venue in Seoul to hold mega-sized concerts. The concerts of band Seventeen and singer Lim Young-woong were held in the stadium, each in April and May of this year, prior to the upcoming IU concert. Operators of the Seoul World Cup Stadium told the local media that warnings about the grass are notified to whoever rents the stadium, and those who rent it are mandated to restore any damages to the field. Grass access is also limited to the minimum number of personnel required to install the stage and conduct the events, they added. The performers themselves also make efforts to minimize damage to the grass, such as Lim not installing seats on the field. IU's agency also vowed to follow the policies by protecting the grass, disassembling the stage as soon as the concert ends, while keeping the grass hydrated and well-ventilated during the event. With concerns over the grass conditions in Sangam, the Korea Football Association is mulling whether to select a different venue for upcoming home matches. The officials, however, said player convenience should be considered in any potential change of venue, and vowed to come up with a solution as soon as possible before the next match in October. South Korea is currently playing to earn one of two direct World Cup berths allocated for the Group B teams in the third round of the Asian Qualifiers. The team will face off against Iraq on Oct. 15 at home on the as yet undecided field. If the country fails to finish in the top two of its group, it will compete in the fourth round for a spot in the inter-confederation playoffs.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/09/12/20240912050871_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
"The Second ""FROM ZIQUEJIE TERRACES TO THE WORLD"" Global Farming Culture Exchange and Mutual Learning Conference Held",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3475617,2024.09.14 05:11,"LOUDI, China, Sept. 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- On September 12, the opening ceremony and keynote speeches of the Second ""FROM ZIQUEJIE TERRACES TO THE WORLD"" Global Farming Culture Exchange and Mutual Learning Conference were presented in Xinhua County, Loudi City, Hunan Province. Over 200 guests, including representatives from international organizations such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), diplomats from terrace-cultivating countries like France and Peru, and domestic and international experts from the agriculture, culture, and tourism sectors, gathered to discuss key issues including the protection of global agricultural cultural heritage and the development of the green agricultural economy. Together, they explored ways to preserve and promote farming culture, showcasing Hunan's unique approach to agricultural heritage protection and innovation, while contributing China's solutions for the safeguarding of global agricultural cultural heritage. During the opening ceremony, the Consensus on the Integrated Development of Terraces in Agriculture, Culture, and Tourism was released. The document promotes the understanding of the value of terraces, the protection of terrace ecosystems, the preservation of farming culture, the active promotion of agriculture, culture, and tourism integration, enhanced international exchange and cooperation, and the innovation of development models. The aim is to promote the effective protection and sustainable development of terraces globally, deepen the integration of agriculture, culture, and tourism, build distinctive terrace-based industrial chains, enhance the overall competitiveness of terrace regions, and achieve ecological, economic, and social benefits for all. Terraced fields exemplify the harmonious coexistence of human ingenuity and nature. They carry rich agricultural traditions and historical memories, and their value in preserving biodiversity, ensuring food security, and promoting regional economic development is immeasurable. The Ziquejie Terraces, recognized as both a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System and a World Heritage Irrigation Structure, are the product of the collective labor of the Miao, Yao, Dong, Han, and other ethnic groups throughout history. These terraces are a historical testament to the merging of mountain hunting cultures with rice farming cultures. Looking ahead, Loudi City will further strengthen the protection of agricultural cultural heritage, promote cultural inheritance, and foster the integration of agriculture, culture, and tourism. Through these efforts, it aims to provide concrete examples of ""authentic protection, living use, and industrial integration"" for the world.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/news/cms/2024/09/14/20240914050005.a90d0dbc-b409-49a3-9f5a-4dd9a2a5dd72_T1.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
"So many epic performances, so few places to hold them",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3471307,2024.09.09 16:40,"While K-pop continues its phenomenal growth and more people attend live performances than ever before, one issue remains unchanged from a decade ago -- the chronic shortage of concert venues. ""Finding a venue is like finding a needle in a haystack,"" said an official from a music festival organizing agency. The official added that many performances that were originally scheduled for December to target the year-end are being pushed to January due to the shortage of venues. Another industry insider also commented on the severe shortage of performance venues. ""It is true that Seoul lacks big concert venues. While international artists often prefer larger venues, they have no choice but to perform in smaller, available spaces to fit their schedules."" The Music Concert Industry Association of Korea, established in March 2021 by 46 entertainment agencies and concert planning companies, announced last week it has launched a petition drive to address the shortage of performance venues in Seoul. The petition aims to pressure the government and the city of Seoul to establish temporary concert venues in the metropolitan area. The association proposes the creation of an integrated task force involving the government, city, sports industry and cultural sector to come up with solutions to the venue shortage issue. Are there really no large-scale concert venues in Korea? One of Seoul's most prominent large-scale venues, Jamsil Olympic Stadium – which can accommodate up to some 60,000 people – will not be able to function as a concert hall for the next few years. Starting in 2027, it will serve as an alternative venue for Jamsil Baseball Stadium, which is set to undergo expansion until 2031. Seoul World Cup Stadium in Sangam-dong, northwestern Seoul, which can hold up to 66,000 people, is primarily a dedicated soccer stadium, making it difficult to secure for concerts. Only a few artists, such as Lim Young-woong, Seventeen and IU, have managed to book the venue. Even when successful, they have faced criticism over potential damage to the soccer field. Other frequently used venues include the 15,000-seat KSPO Dome, originally a gymnastics venue for the 1988 Seoul Olympics, and the 20,000-seat Gocheok Sky Dome, Korea's first enclosed dome baseball stadium. The Olympic Hall, a popular music-specific concert venue located in Olympic Park in eastern Seoul, has only 3,000 seats, while the adjacent SK Handball Gymnasium can accommodate up to 5,000 people. In comparison to Japan, which has five venues with over 30,000 seats and more than 40 venues with more than 10,000 seats, Korea's concert venue infrastructure falls far short in both size and number. The emergence of global idol groups and popular trot singers has resulted in massive fan bases that can fill large concert venues, but the growing demand for more venues has been unmet. This lack of large concert venues has led to some top international artists -- including Taylor Swift -- to skip South Korea on their world tours. Additionally, since most large concert venues here are primarily sports facilities, government and sporting events are given priority, leaving very few dates available for concerts. ""The size of the venue is a measure of an artist's capability, but right now, Korean artists have no way to gauge their popularity beyond the 18,000-seat KSPO Dome,"" the insider explained. ""It would be great if there were venues for artists who attract between 20,000 and 50,000 fans,"" the insider further noted, pointing out the lack of a venue between the 18,000-capacity KSPO Dome and 60,000-capacity World Cup Stadium. The official added that using a sports facility as a concert venue requires significant preparation and investment. ""I understand that some sports stadiums overseas are designed to be easily converted into concert venues, with features like reversible surfaces to protect the turf and better sound equipment. However, since we perform in sports stadiums that weren't built with these considerations in mind, the cost of preparing for a concert is much higher."" Is construction the solution? Meanwhile, some argue that building large-scale venues is not the only solution. Pop music critic Lim Hee-yun pointed out that while the demand for concerts has indeed increased, the key question is whether this demand will be sustained in the future. ""It is true that there has been a significant rise in the number of festivals, concerts and international artists' tours, leading to a shortage of venues. However, constructing new venues requires substantial budget and given the uncertainty about future demand, careful consideration is necessary,"" Lim said. Lim referred to the recently failed K-Culture Valley project in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, highlighting the risks associated with large-scale venue projects. The K-Culture Valley project aimed to build a cutting-edge large-scale concert hall and studio on a 237,000-square-meter lot, approximately the size of 46 soccer fields, in Goyang, just outside Seoul. However, CJ LiveCity, the project developer, halted construction in April 2023 and its contract with Gyeonggi Province was terminated in July of this year, effectively ending the project. ""As K-pop grew explosively, there were numerous plans for arena venues. Local governments showed interest and invested in these projects. But we have started to see cases where these plans fizzled out. Ultimately, the most feasible option is to make use of existing venues,"" Lim assessed. Ilsan's Kintex and the Goyang Sports Complex are examples of existing venues being used for concerts. One of the most prominent venues, KSPO Dome, initially criticized for its inadequate sound system, has become a more fitting venue after remodeling and various improvements. This suggests that developing and enhancing existing facilities could also be a viable solution. Lim further emphasized the need to consider multipurpose spaces, noting that many overseas venues serve both as concert halls and sports facilities. ""Wembley Stadium in London is used both as a soccer stadium and a concert venue, and SoFi Stadium in LA serves as an NFL stadium and a concert venue. Globally iconic venues often have multipurpose functions, combining sports events with concerts.""",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/09/09/20240909050660_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Jo Jung-suk says his wife Gummy gave him most confidence for 'A-List to Playlist',https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3462758,2024.08.27 19:23,"Korea's beloved actor Jo Jung-suk said his wife and popular singer Park Ji-yeon, more famously known by her stage name Gummy, has been his greatest source of confidence in pursuing his dream of becoming a singer, via Netflix original ""A-List to Playlist."" ""A-List to Playlist"" will follow actor Jo Jung-suk's quest to fulfill his dream of debuting as a singer-songwriter. The eight-part series documents Jo's 100-day journey to create an album, with support from popular singer-songwriters, including Lee Ji-eun (IU), Park Hyo-shin and his wife Gummy. The show is co-directed by star producer Yang Jung-woo, known for hits such as ""New Journey to the West"" and ""Youth Over Flowers,"" alongside producer Lee Jung-won. ""I first met Jo nine years ago while working on 'Youth Over Flowers.' When the cameras were off, I happened to see him relaxing, and even then, he was playing the guitar and enjoying music. I thought that if I ever had the chance to capture the true essence of Jo (on-screen), it would be great to do so, especially with content that involves music,"" said Yang, during a press conference held in Mapo-gu, Seoul, Tuesday. Producer Lee explained that their primary focus was on allowing the show to develop naturally. ""With the content being a reality program, we aimed to capture the story as it unfolded at Jo's pace. We did not want to introduce any artificial elements. Although we did incorporate some entertaining segments, the majority of the show follows a sequential format,"" Lee said. Jo admitted he had had reservations about producing a show focused solely on his journey. However, he said his wife had given him the confidence to move forward. “Gummy reassured me personally that it was okay to trust myself and continue. That was the greatest encouragement I received,"" said Jo. Jo said in his album, he intended to feature songs of diverse genres. ""I primarily used the guitar, aiming to craft songs that highlighted its qualities. I worked diligently without confining myself to a specific genre. I believed that restricting the genre would impose limits, so I experimented with various styles and ended up discovering some great songs,"" said Jo.

Growing influence of Thailand in K-pop industry,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3457682,2024.08.20 15:04,"As K-pop continues to impact the global music scene, it's clear that success isn't driven solely by the bands and their music. Fans around the world play a crucial role in propelling K-pop artists forward, with their unwavering support and engagement. Traditionally, the US, Japan and the UK have been seen as the most important markets due to their size and impact on the global music industry. However, the rise of digital platforms like TikTok and Instagram is shifting this dynamic, allowing Southeast Asian countries -- particularly Thailand -- to exert significant influence on the K-pop industry. Thailand, with its passionate fanbase and influential social media, is emerging as a key player in K-pop's global expansion. In July last year, a single TikTok video by Thai influencer Alice Ratchadawan brought a relatively obscure South Korean indie band, Wave to Earth, into the international spotlight. Her use of the band's track ""Bad"" for her marriage proposal video resonated far beyond Thailand, quickly going viral around the world. The song surged to the top of Spotify's ""Viral 50"" chart in Thailand, illustrating social media's power to expand the reach of K-pop. As a result of this viral moment, Wave to Earth saw its Spotify monthly listeners skyrocket, surpassing some of South Korea's most established artists, including IU. As of Tuesday, Wave to Earth boasts over 6.2 million monthly listeners on Spotify, compared to IU's 5 million. Hong Jong-hee, head of communications at TikTok Korea, emphasized the crucial role of the Southeast Asian market in K-pop’s global spread. ""Southeast Asian creators have a significant global influence because they frequently and explosively reproduce Korean content in their own unique style. On TikTok, Southeast Asia is the leading region for the production and consumption of K-content, with Indonesia ranking first and Thailand also standing out,"" Hong said on Tuesday. “The power of TikTok in Southeast Asia is incomparable to that in South Korea.” Despite Indonesia's larger music market due to its vast young population, Thailand wields greater influence on K-pop, thanks to its prominent K-pop artists like Ten of NCT, BamBam of Got7 and Lisa of Blackpink. ""Korean music labels have been recruiting Thai members to attract fans not only in Thailand but also in neighboring countries such as Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam (CLMV). For instance, YG Entertainment's recent moves with the K-pop girl group Baby Monster are a strategic effort to dominate the Thai market and, by extension, the CLMV region,"" said Suwat Wuthichairattanaporn, a 20-year veteran of the Thai entertainment industry, on Tuesday. ""It is a smart strategy to appeal to Southeast Asia, a dynamic and rapidly growing region within the global music industry."" Thailand’s centralized population and well-developed infrastructure, particularly in Bangkok, give it an edge over neighboring countries like Vietnam and Myanmar. These factors enable the rapid production of secondary content and make Thailand especially effective in generating viral short-form videos on social media. ""Recently, Lisa of Blackpink has been filming music videos in Thailand, likely driven not just by patriotism but also by data-driven decisions,"" music critic Lim Hee-yun said on Tuesday. ""This underscores Thailand's potential as a cultural hub in Asia and highlights its well-developed infrastructure and capabilities, which will likely continue to amplify the Thai music market's impact on K-pop,"" Lim added.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/08/20/20240820050563_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
[Drama Tour] Feel ‘My Mister’ mood in Yongsan,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3444938,2024.08.03 16:01,"Yongsan-gu in central Seoul is one of the go-to spots for both local and overseas travelers. The district became popular for its Itaewon neighborhood -- where people can experience and enjoy a variety of international cultures -- many years ago. It also beckons history buffs with the National Museum of Korea and the War Memorial of Korea. Today, it is easy to spot young, vibrant K-pop fans near Sinyongsan Station, where the headquarters of Hybe, the K-pop powerhouse behind BTS, are located. Meanwhile, “Yongnidan-gil,” a cluster of streets between Samgakji Station and Sinyongsan Station, is a hot spot among Koreans wanting to take Instagrammable photos and spend quality time with their friends. But, for those who feel exploring these sites is not enough, a five to six-minute walk from Yongsan-gu’s iconic shopping complex, HDC IPark Mall, takes you to Baekbin Railroad Crossing where you can experience a uniquely retro vibe. This railroad crossing was heavily featured in the mega-hit drama series “My Mister” (2018). The two lead characters -- a senior supervisor of a company Park Dong-hoon (played by the late Lee Sun-kyun) and his teammate Lee Ji-ahn (played by IU) -- who lived in same neighborhood, often ran into each other there on their commute to work. Though Baekbin Railroad Crossing, surrounded by old-fashioned shops, low-rise buildings and houses, is an interesting place during the day, its true charms are revealed once the sun sets. At night, red traffic lights, flashy head lamps and LED signs light up the narrow alleys. As one of the few remaining railroad crossings in Seoul, even some of its smallest details, from the crossbuck to the barriers and alarm bell attached to a mast, catch the eyes of drama fans and travelers alike. This crossing road is also known as “Ttaeng Ttaeng Street,” after the sound of the train bell. “I really find this railroad crossing special, because you can easily feel the retro vibe in central Seoul. The contrast between the skyscrapers and the nearby old-fashioned houses seems interesting to me. It is certainly a cool place to take some memorable photos,” a 25-year-old university student surnamed Park told The Korea Herald on Tuesday. While taking a light stroll around the area, visitors can see office workers having their “hoesik,” or after-work get-together, in the nearby restaurants just like the characters in “My Mister.” If you wish to enjoy Jeju’s renowned black pork cuts, head over to Childonga for dinner. You can also try some unique “hansik,” or Korean cuisine, like beef tartare bibimbap at JipJip. If you are not a big fan of a gastronomic journey, head over to the IPark Mall’s colorful outdoor plaza or RM Forest No. 2 at the nearby Han River Park before calling it a day. In this series, The Korea Herald introduces travel destinations featured in hit drama series with the hope of inspiring readers to immerse themselves in the popular scenes and scenery of their favorite shows.

Price of stardom?,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3436258,2024.07.17 14:57,"K-pop stars feel threatened by obsessive ‘sasaeng’ fans Behind K-pop's rapid growth and immense popularity, there is a persistent, chronic problem that follows fame: Stalkers, often called ""sasaeng"" in Korea. ""I am not sasaeng. I am just a genuine fan who really loves NCT,"" said an 18-year-old girl who wished to remain anonymous. She claims that all her actions are out of sincere support and love -- taking taxis to follow her favorite singer as he goes about his day and waiting for hours at the airport to take photos of the group, to name but a few. She admits that she even knows where the celebrities live. ""Sometimes I spend about 300,000 won ($217) on taxis to follow NCT's schedule. They even talk to me in person sometimes!"" That ""talk"" involved members telling her to go home now. Call for end to harassment Despite the growing awareness of the need to respect artists' privacy, the excessive actions of some individuals continue to torment celebrities who call for relief from constant harassment by ""sasaeng."" “Sasaeng” is a term used to describe fans who invade artists’ privacy, often exhibiting aggressive and obsessive behaviors. After months of harassment by sasaeng, Renjun of NCT said on the fan communication platform on April 11, ""Sasaengs are nothing but scary stalkers to me. They follow me, sit next to me on planes, and take photos of me while I sleep. It's a huge burden for me,"" Later that month, Renjun announced he would take a break from work citing health reasons. He continued to be hounded by phone calls from sasaeng and, in June, he took action by posting what he thought was a phone number of sasaeng on a fan communication platform. It turned out that the number belonged to a non-fan. When the incident caused an uproar, Renjun posted an apology on social media. Haechan, another member of NCT, has also suffered from sasaeng harassment. In November last year, a sasaeng walked into Haechan’s home, where he lives with his family. The methods used by sasaeng to reach celebrities have become increasingly cunning. Some make calls by manipulating phone numbers and pretending to be fellow K-pop group members. Techniques commonly used in voice phishing scams are now being employed by sasaeng. Some even call during live broadcasts to verify if the number they have is the celebrity's. Some sasaeng use K-pop stars' frequent international travels as additional opportunities to follow them. “On a return flight to Seoul after a fan signing event, we found that someone had already pre-booked and changed the in-flight meals for the members' seats,” said TXT’s Taehyun through the fan communication platform Weverse on June 29, adding suspicion that it might have been the act of sasaeng. Asked about the allegations that sasaeng fans had changed in-flight meal orders, a Korean Air official said, “To change in-flight meal reservation information, one would need the ticket reservation number and the phone number associated with the reservation record. Whether it was a sasaeng's work needs to be confirmed."" The official, however, did confirm that actions by sasaeng fans have caused inconvenience on multiple occasions. “Sasaeng fans have repeatedly bought tickets just to follow stars into the area past the immigration only to cancel the tickets right before the flight, demanding refunds. We have had to implement cancellation fees. These fees are not solely due to sasaeng issues, but they have certainly been a factor,” the official said. An Asiana Airlines official also said the company instituted penalty rules for ticket cancellations made just before boarding due to troubles with sasaeng. Some stars have resorted to drastic measures to avoid sasaeng harassment when traveling. During a Naver V Live broadcast in 2019, BTS’s V also revealed that BTS uses private flights due to sasaeng issues. ""We would like to fly on regular flights, but some people figure out our flight schedule and sit next to us. It's very uncomfortable because we can't relax in our private space. It scares me a lot and I wish it would stop,"" he said. The problem of saesaeng harassment persists despite entertainment agencies' efforts -- ranging from warnings to legal actions -- to protect their artists. Edam Entertainment, singer IU's agency, claiming severe privacy violations at airport security zones, duty-free shops, aboard flights and at hotels, issued a press statement on June 18, which said, ""Please refrain from attempting conversations, taking photos, giving gifts, or filming the artist onboard."" K-pop powerhouse, SM Entertainment, announced on March 6 that it would take legal action on sasaeng harassment of NCT members. But warning appears to have had little impact given the continued harassment experienced by Renjun. Hybe, which established a task force in 2023 to tackle the illegal trading of stars' flight information, recently reported that they had identified social media accounts trading artists' flight information. They have secured evidence to identify these individuals and submitted it to the police. The police, for their part, are reported to have conducted long-term investigations both domestically and internationally and some cases have been sent to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office. The illegally traded information was used to obtain seat information to board the same flight and attempt close contact with the celebrities. Flocks of fans following idol members are a common occurrence but dangerous situations often dp arise. On June 16, fans who gathered at Incheon International Airport to see the boy group Riize returning from an overseas event broke an automatic door when things became disorderly. Photos taken in such situations often become commodities. Fans who cannot attend events sometimes hire others to get photos or purchase photos. Posts selling photos taken at airports or other events are easy to find on social media platform X. Photos of stars are not the only thing for sale on the Internet. It is not difficult to find posts offering to sell information about K-pop singers, including their homes, personalities, phone numbers, relationship status and even details like their exes. ""I can't exactly count the number of purchase requests, but I do make some money out of it,"" said an anonymous X user who posted about selling celebrities' private information. ""I don't worry about the agency's warning. They don't take serious actions on sasaeng or people who provide information on artists,"" added the user. Kwak Keum-joo, a professor of psychology at Seoul National University, explained that obsession with celebrities is often accompanied by fantasies about the object of affection. “Having affection for someone is natural, but if that affection becomes excessive and especially if the person is not someone you interact with in your daily life, one may create a distorted fantasy about the person and become obsessed with it,” Kwak said. Kwak further explained that sasaeng fans' actions are a form of self-defense. “Some overly obsessive fans cannot tolerate any deviation from the image they have created in their minds. They continue their excessive behavior to maintain their affection and fantasy.” Kwak also noted that the diffusion of responsibility in crowd psychology encourages excessive actions among sasaeng fans. “When acting in a group, people become more aggressive and are less likely to recognize the wrongfulness of their actions. They mistakenly believe they have no responsibility for their actions as more people are acting just like them.” “It is a shame that sasaeng problem continues to persist, but celebrities must maintain their fandom to survive, so this issue is likely to persist,” Professor Kwak added.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/07/17/20240717050640_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Alteogen Receives Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) Approval for Tergase®,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3431194,2024.07.09 00:10,"Tergase® poised to capture a fair share of the global hyaluronidase market. DAEJEON, South Korea, July 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Alteogen Inc.

[Drama Tour] Journey to dream-like travel spots of ‘The Sound of Magic’,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3428945,2024.07.06 16:01,"ANSEONG, Gyeonggi Province -- If you are making a list of places to visit with your family and friends after the monsoon season, the filming sites of Netflix’s “The Sound of Magic” certainly needs to be on the list. “The Sound of Magic,” a 2022 fantasy musical drama, centers around Ah-yi, a schoolgirl who wishes to become an adult as soon as possible so that she may take care of her family. The series focuses heavily on the character’s emotional change after meeting Ri-eul, a mysterious magician who shows her the beauty and wonders of life. Aside from the dynamic changes, another beauty of this drama series is the dream-like filming spots that give off magical vibe. Though the backdrops present colorful changes, applying light and shade meticulously, the original filming sites themselves are a feast for the eyes. Anseong Farmland Anseong Farmland is home to open field of canola flowers that made its first appearance as Il-deung, Ah-yi’s schoolmate, dreams, exhausted from private lessons outside school and pressure to excel in his studies. Though a wide array of sunflowers have replaced the canola flowers now, the vastness of the seemingly unending flower field presented in “The Sound of Magic” can still be seen in Anseong Farmland. “Visitors can feel different vibes from the four different types of flowers that are changed with every season. The canola flowers are for the spring. We have sunflowers at the moment. Travelers can enjoy the cosmos and pink muhly in autumn. They can see the field covered in snow in winter as well,” an Anseong Farmland official told The Korea Herald on Monday. The sunflower field was visited by many couples who wished to capture the summer moment or make their latest Instagram updates with loved ones. “For those who want to take a picture that looks like a scene from a romance drama, a bright-colored parasol is required. It fits well with the yellow sunflowers,” a Suwon-based housewife surnamed Kim, who was there with her husband, said as she shared tips on elevating photographs of sunflowers to another level. Visitors can enjoy the flower field from a wooden observatory or climb the slope to take in a panoramic view of Anseong Farmland. Visitors, especially children, can participate in diverse hands-on activities here, including feeding animals, horseback riding and amusement rides. One of the must-see programs is the parade of animals living on the farmland. Starting with the opening ceremony by a disc dog, farm animals ranging from geese, ducks and chickens to pigs and lambs make a short parade like Olympic athletes, sparking children’s interest and curiosity. The performance is held at the outdoor garden, but people can take a close look at the animals from their seats where shades are installed to block out the bright sunlight. The highlight of the show is a demonstration of agility by Lover, a border collie and the Anseong Farmland superstar. The speed of Lover is more than enough to mesmerize not only pet-loving children, but also their parents, trying to capture every move of this border collie. As the sound of the spectators’ applause gets louder, Lover runs quicker and completes the course in style. Anseong Farmland is open every day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Yongma Land Located at the foot of Yongmasan, in Jungnang-gu, eastern Seoul, Yongma Land is an amusement park that opened in 1983 but shut down in 2011. This derelict building is a nostalgia-filled space that has inspired numerous TV directors and moviemakers. K-pop fans will easily recognize the site from their favorite idols’ photographs and music videos, including of EXO, Twice, IU, Eric Nam and Wendy of Red Velvet and more. Yongma Land served as home to the magician Ri-eul and a stage for musical performances by the lead characters in “The Sound of Magic.” “A few attractions, like the Ferris wheel, were removed after the shoot, but drama fans can spot the iconic rides that appeared in the series, including the merry-go-round,” the Yongma Land official said on Monday. Though the abandoned theme park is open to visitors, Yongma Land is frequented by photographers who come to take pictures for various purposes such as wedding photos and advertisements according to the park official. Visitors can explore different areas of the theme park and ride the motionless mini train, pirate ship and merry-go-round during the day. But, Yongma Land’s true charm is revealed at night, when the orange-colored light bulbs illuminate every corner of the theme park. Visitors can make online reservations to enjoy an outdoor barbecue and stay overnight at the theme park via Naver Booking as well.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/07/04/20240704050782_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

NABR Commends the IUCN's Decision to Reassess the Status of Long-Tailed Macaques,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3423434,2024.06.25 10:10,"A Science-Based Approach Will Determine if the Species is Truly 'Endangered' WASHINGTON, June 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The National Association for Biomedical Research (NABR) commends the Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s decision to reassess the 'Endangered' designation of long-tailed macaque monkeys (macaca fascicularis). ""NABR is pleased that the IUCN will reassess its designation of long-tailed macaques as 'Endangered',"" said Matthew R. Bailey, president of NABR. ""The IUCN's decision to uplist long tailed macaques to 'Endangered' in 2022 was not justified, nor supported by scientific information. NABR looks forward to working with the IUCN to ensure the scientific integrity of its processes."" In 2023, NABR convened a technical review team to review the basis of the IUCN designation.1 In September 2023, NABR filed a formal petition with the IUCN followed by an expanded petition in February 2024. The expanded petition requested that the IUCN undertake a new science-based assessment of the species' status. NABR's expanded petition demonstrates that the 2022 review by Hansen et. al., which the IUCN used as the basis for its decision to uplist the long-tailed macaque's status, misrepresents existing data.2 A separate petition filed by Dr. Hank Jenkins asserts that the Hansen et al. (2022) review authors possess conflicts of interest that require further investigation by the IUCN. This petition remains pending before the IUCN. While the IUCN does not have any legislative or regulatory authority, its 'Red List' may influence policy decisions regarding the species. The IUCN's decision to reassess its 'Endangered' designation of long-tailed macaques is important because the species is used extensively in biomedical research. Six of the 25 most used prescription drugs were developed with the help of long tailed macaques3. Research with long tailed macaques has also been crucial for advances in regenerative medicine4, immunology5, cancer6, vaccine development7, and pharmacology8.

Riize shows youthful groove through 1st EP ‘Riizing’,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3417551,2024.06.18 15:09,"K-pop boy group Riize took its signature genre, ""emotional pop,"" to the next level in its first mini album, “Riizing,” released on Monday. “Our first mini album carries eight tracks to offer a full experience of our signature genre, emotional pop. The title of the album shows our desire to continue moving forward,” said Sungchan of Riize during a press conference in Seoul on Monday held to mark the album's release. Riize describes “emotional pop” as a fusion genre of punk rock and pop accompanied by lyrics that people can relate to emotionally. The group's first mini album is led by the lead track, “Boom Boom Bass.” “The lead track is a funky disco number anchored by a groovy bass line that portrays the excitement of youth and freedom through bass guitar performances,” said Wonbin of Riize. “We tried to show the group’s chemistry in the song by, for example, including a 'pair rap' of Shotaro and Sungchan. It’s an energetic song so we tried to enjoy and have fun when recording to pour our positive energy into it,” said Sohee of Riize. The group hopes to prove that it's gotten better both vocally and performance-wise through this new album. “Our ultimate goal is to continue rising. We want people to think we’ve become better artists than when we were promoting ‘Get A Guitar,'” said Eunseok of Riize. Riize debuted in September last year with the debut single album, “Get A Guitar,” which sold over a million copies, a first for a K-pop debut album. The six-member group is currently on fan concert tour “Riizing Day,” visiting fans in nine cities around the world, including Los Angeles, Tokyo and Bangkok. “We’re really honored that we will be able to hold the finale of our fan concert tour at the KSPO Dome in September. We had a chance to perform at the venue as a guest performer at IU’s concert earlier this year, but now we get to hold our own concert there. It’s so surreal and we are looking forward to it,” said Anton of Riize.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/06/18/20240618050597_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
[Herald Review] AKMU reminisces past 10 years with fans,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3417027,2024.06.17 16:12,"Standing on top of a green grass hill, the main stage decor, a children's choir opened the K-pop sibling duo AKMU’s two-day concert singing “Last Goodbye.” AKMU then appeared on a lift in a navy suit and dress to perform “Every Little Thing” with a live band and a string orchestra. The K-pop duo was welcomed by 10,500 people in the audience holding green fan lights that shined like fireflies glowing on summer evenings. Sunday’s show was the last day of AKMU’s two-day 10th-anniversary concert “10VE” at the Kspo Dome in Seoul. With musical actors taking part in AKMU’s performances adding more emotion and liveliness to the stage, the concert felt like a musical. “I didn’t want you to come to our concert to just listen to us sing. Instead, I wanted our concert to be like a picnic that you can enjoy peacefully and go back home filled with love,” said Lee Chan-hyuk of AKMU. Chan-hyuk had a solo stage performing “Bench” during which he had a chance to show off his dancing skills. Lee Su-hyun of AKMU then performed “Re-bye” alone holding a feather fan. She added some acting and altered the song to make it jazzier. In the setlist of 21 songs, AKMU included many tracks from its debut album “Play” released in 2014. “We wanted to take you guys back 10 years. Our concept for the debut album was fairies living in a forest. That is why the set is a scene from a fairytale,” said Su-hyun. Su-hyun then sat down in front of a piano and Chan-hyuk took out his acoustic guitar. “We used to play like this when we were young living in Mongolia,” Su-hyun told her brother. The siblings then dazzled the audience singing “Time and Fallen Leaves” and “How can I love the heartbreak, you’re the one I love” while playing their instruments. For the second part of the show, AKMU appeared inside a cave under the green hill. “Hi, we are the acoustic duo AKMU,” said AKMU, just like how they introduced themselves when starring on SBS’ audition show “K-pop Star Season 2"" in 2012. The duo performed a medley of singles “Crescendo,” “On the Subway,” “The Love of Foreigner” and “Little Star.” Near the show's end, K-pop soloist IU made a surprise appearance as a guest performer. “It’s an honor to be invited to AKMU’s 10th anniversary concert. I was their guest performer for their first-ever standalone concert as well, so this is very meaningful. I want to congratulate them for becoming one of the best South Korean musicians,” said IU. IU performed “The Meaning Of You” and “Blueming.” Su-hyun also performed an unreleased song “Remember” for the first time on stage. “This is a song that I made thinking about my younger self. I am happy I get to sing this song in front of you guys,” said Su-hyun. The song is about a girl chasing her dreams and the older Su-hyun telling her younger self that she has the right to be happy. The concert reached its climax when AKMU performed “Green Window” and “200%.” “This will be an unforgettable concert for us. Through this concert, we wanted to look back on our lives which had their ups and downs. The last song reminisces on our childhood,” said Chan-hyuk. AKMU wrapped up the concert with “Will Last Forever.”",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/06/17/20240617050604_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Octapharma's continuing dedication to improving the lives of people with rare bleeding disorders to be showcased at ISTH 2024,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3412518,2024.06.11 00:20,"Octapharma to present new clinical and scientific findings for wilate® and Nuwiq® at the upcoming ISTH 2024 Congress New data and clinical study developments to be showcased in seven oral presentations, two posters and two Supported Symposia LACHEN, Switzerland, June 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The most recent developments from Octapharma's Haematology portfolio will be presented at the 32nd Congress of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) on June 22–26, 2024, in Bangkok, Thailand. The data will be featured in seven oral presentations, two poster presentations and two Supported Symposia during this key international meeting. Octapharma is a proud Silver Supporter of the ISTH 2024 Congress. Octapharma will also present the offer in modern solutions for acute bleeding and coagulation management in critical and intensive care. Bleeding disorders, such as haemophilia A and von Willebrand disease (VWD), carry the risk of recurrent and prolonged bleeds, which can not only be life-threatening but also take a heavy toll on patients' quality of life and mental health. The presentations at ISTH 2024 reflect Octapharma's long-term commitment to improving patient care and addressing unmet clinical needs. ""Octapharma is excited to present our latest findings and study results from across our haematology and critical care portfolios at ISTH 2024."" said Olaf Walter, Board Member at Octapharma. ""Bleeding and coagulation disorder patients continue to face many challenges in their day-to-day care and bleeding management. Here at Octapharma we remain dedicated to frontline research towards improving patients' lives."" Oral Presentations Although prophylaxis is the standard of care for severe haemophilia A, it remains underutilised in VWD. WIL-31, the largest study in VWD prophylaxis, demonstrated the safety and efficacy of prophylaxis with a plasma-derived von Willebrand factor/factor VIII concentrate (wilate®) in patients with VWD. The lead investigator, Dr Robert F. Sidonio Jr., will present sub-analyses of data from the study which explore differences in bleed sites across VWD types and age groups. Prophylaxis was well-tolerated across all age groups in the 22 VWD type 3 patients who were included in the analysis population. MOTIVATE is an ongoing, international, investigator-initiated study supported through funding from Octapharma AG, evaluating the management of haemophilia A patients with inhibitors. Dr Carmen Escuriola-Ettingshausen, one of the study's coordinating investigators, will present an interim analysis of the study. Haemophilic arthropathy is a serious complication of haemophilia A and early diagnosis is critical to minimise its long-term impact. A proof-of-concept study has identified a signature of several circulating small non-coding microRNAs, which may be used as biomarkers to assist in the diagnosis of haemophilic arthropathy. Future work will investigate microRNAs associated with earlier stages of the condition in a sub-study of the PROVE clinical trial. Altered microvascular endothelial functionality has been observed in haemophilia A patients. Indeed, impaired tubulogenesis, migration and permeability of endothelial cells from haemophilia A patients has been observed, compared to those from healthy patients. New data will be presented showing that Nuwiq® can bind to endothelial cell surfaces, improving their functionality. FVIII physically interacts with platelets following vascular injury to ensure efficient clot formation. Different FVIII modifications may impact platelet binding and downstream signalling. Data will be presented showing that Nuwiq® exhibits significantly higher binding to platelets compared to comparator products, and that these differences in platelet binding may impact the efficacy of different rFVIII products in the treatment of haemophilia A. The oral presentations are scheduled at the following times: Sunday June 23 OC 27.5: Impact of differential binding of recombinant factor VIII concentrates to platelets on platelet clotting functionality. Presenting author: Viola Vogel. 15:45–16:00 ICT, Room 210 A-D Monday June 24 OC 35.1: Factor VIII regulates extracellular matrix proteins to stimulate angiogenesis and vessel stability. Presenting author: Alessia Cucci. 9:30–9:45 ICT, Room 110 A-C OC 36.4: miRNA expression profiles as a potential biomarker of joint and bone health in haemophilia A.

Huawei and IUCN Host Tech4Nature Summit to Promote Innovation in Nature Conservation,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3409125,2024.06.07 00:10,"SHENZHEN, China, June 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Huawei and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) jointly hosted the 2024 Tech4Nature Summit yesterday to mark the commencement of Phase 2 of the Tech4Nature global partnership and further promote innovation in nature conservation. Aligned with Huawei's TECH4ALL initiative and IUCN's Green List, Tech4Nature represents the joint vision of both partners to develop technological solutions for Protected and Conserved Areas (PCA) across the globe. It is also the first time that either Huawei or IUCN has established a major partnership spanning both the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and nature conservation sectors. ""The natural world faces unprecedented challenges, and technology and digital solutions can be a powerful force for good to protect our planet's biodiversity. That is why IUCN established the Tech4Nature partnership with Huawei,"" said Dr. Grethel Aguilar, Director General of IUCN. ""I am proud to see this partnership moving to the next phase, helping all stakeholders to unite for nature and build a better future."" Tech4Nature Phase 1 Tech4Nature Phase 1 ran from 2020 to 2023 in five PCAs in China, Mauritius, Mexico, Spain, and Switzerland. Major successes include: Acoustic monitoring of the world's rarest ape - the Hainan gibbon - to identity individual animals with a view to helping this critically endangered species repopulate. Just 37 individuals currently remain. AI pattern recognition to identify and track jaguars in Mexico; the presence of seven individuals was confirmed in Dzilam State Reserve last year for the first time. Advanced systems for live viewing and monitoring of coral reef conservation and restoration projects run by local communities in Mauritius; 25,000 healthy coral fragments have already been transplanted to degraded areas of reef in the Indian Ocean. ""As a technical partner of governments, customers, and environmental protection agencies, Huawei is ready to continuously to explore environment and nature protection scenarios, develop appropriate digital technologies to address environmental protection challenges, and jointly build a more equal and sustainable digital world,"" said Tao Jingwen, Board Member and Chairman of the CSD Committee for Huawei. ""Huawei implements four sustainable development strategies as well as the S.H.A.R.E concept: To ensure a sustainable digital future (Sustainable), we will work with industry chain partners to build a harmonious and healthy business ecosystem (Harmony), maximize equality and accessibility through digital inclusion (TECH4ALL), and develop secure and reliable ICT infrastructure and services to safeguard the digital world (Reliability). Through scientific and technological innovation, we can achieve social development and ecological balance together (Environment)."" Tech4Nature Phase 2 Tech4Nature Phase 2 (2023–2026) will support flagship six projects in China, Mexico, Spain, Brazil, Kenya, and Türkiye. The summit marked the official launch of these six projects, following the agreement to launch Phase 2 that Huawei and IUCN announced in October 2023. Phase 2 also represents the joint commitment of IUCN and Huawei to support the 30x30 target and Target 4 on preventing extinction defined in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). This phase will also expand collaboration between the technology and nature conservation sectors by involving more people, partners, and countries. The summit was attended by conservation practitioners, academics, private sector and government representatives, and the broader Tech4Nature community. Workshops were held to build capacity among partners, explore action plans for achieving fair and effective conservation through the IUCN Green List, discuss ethical considerations and provide guidance on implementation, and enable peer-to-peer learning and exchange. The partners also launched the Tech4Nature flagship publication Partnership for our Planet. Available for download on the Tech4Nature website, the publication highlights the crucial position that cutting-edge technological solutions occupy in responding to modern conservation challenges.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/news/cms/2024/06/07/20240606050200.67633996-2630-43dd-afef-674008202ac2_T1.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
"There are no good or bad oil crops, only good and bad practices",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3393645,2024.05.14 20:10,"New Report Reveals: It's the Practices, Not the Plants, That Matter in Vegetable Oil Production BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei, May 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Few topics have provoked as many polarized views and headlines as oil crops. These controversies span conservation, human rights, and nutrition, but what does the evidence reveal? A new report produced by Borneo Futures, the host organization of the IUCN Oil Crops Task Force provides fresh insights. Oil crops, occupying 37% of global cropland, play a significant role in biodiversity loss and are linked to various human rights violations. However, they also serve as essential sources of income and nutrition. With global vegetable oil demand projected to rise, reaching 288 million tons by 2050, the need for sustainable production practices is urgent. The report underscores that all oil crops, including seemingly benign ones like olive and coconut, can have negative impacts when produced without regard for people or nature. Rather than demonizing specific crops, attention should be directed towards sustainable production practices. ""What this report shows is that positive outcomes can be achieved with all oil crops. With the right investment, planning, policies and improved crop production methods, oil crop areas can offer substantial opportunities for reducing biodiversity loss, addressing human rights issues and restoring nature,"" said Professor Erik Meijaard, report lead author and co-chair of IUCN's Oil Crops Task Force. Using oil palm as an example, he illustrates how this crop, when managed in African forests and village gardens, contrasts starkly with its cultivation in monocultures that replace biodiverse Asian forests when not adopting sustainability practices. ""it is not the palm, but the context in which it is grown, that determines the impacts"", he said. Malika Virah-Sawmy, co-chair of the IUCN Oil Crops Task Force, challenges the narrative that categorizes certain oil crops as inherently good or bad. Instead, she urges stakeholders to focus on production practices rather than demonizing specific crops. The report has some surprising findings. Areas currently cultivating maize and coconut present significant opportunities for reducing extinction risks of threatened species. Yet, the concentration of power in the global grain trade, with just four companies controlling 75-95%, poses challenges to equitable agricultural practices. While impacts from crops like oil palm and soybean are well-documented, others like peanuts and sesame remain understudied despite their association with ecosystem conversion and human rights concerns. This lack of data underscores the importance of informed public discourse to avoid unjustified polarization. In a rapidly growing oil market, understanding the complexities of production is crucial for making sustainable choices. The report aims to fill some of the existing gaps in knowledge while recognizing the need for further research to address remaining blind spots. Professor Douglas Sheil said ""we need to shift the focus from what's planted to how it's grown, traded, marketed and consumed. This report is our first attempt to overview practices, impacts and standards and what can be done"". In a world where the choices we make impact ecosystems and communities globally, understanding the complexities of vegetable oil production is essential for creating a sustainable future. Concerned people should download the free report, inform themselves about the complex world of vegetable oils, and learn what they can do themselves. The study was funded independently by Soremartec SA and Soremartec Italia S.r.l., Ferrero Group, and offers a comprehensive overview of practices, impacts, and standards in vegetable oil production.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/news/cms/2024/05/14/20240514050715.4c9c06eb-f217-4d18-80ca-4a93dfc1c648_T1.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
"Classic spring K-pop songs: Voices of the young, in-love or melancholic",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3361499,2024.04.02 15:39,"Korea's spring anthems reflect conflicting feelings about the season of romance As spring approaches, many Koreans eagerly tune in to timeless spring-themed songs -- joyful yet poignant melodies that signal the arrival of what is thought of here as the season of love. These songs consistently occupy top positions on national record charts every spring, reflecting Koreans’ enduring affection for these tracks, as the season adorns the nation with colorful blossoms and new leaves. Yet, of four popular songs about spring, the themes they deal with are divided between positive and critical views about spring's romantic allure, indicating two conflicting feelings about the season. Anthems for the enamored ""Cherry Blossom Ending"" by Busker Busker “Spring, Spring, Spring” by Roy Kim ""As the spring wind blows/ The scattering cherry blossom petals/ Spread out on this street/ As we walk together."" (""Cherry Blossom Ending"") Just as young couples in Korea celebrate Christmas Eve together, springtime events such as cherry blossom festivals teem with people on dates. The pink hue of blooming cherry blossoms is often employed as a metaphor for blossoming romance in popular culture here. In a 2022 survey conducted by South Korean polling app Cratos, of four popular spring songs in South Korea, more than 60 percent of 10,798 respondents selected Busker Busker's ""Cherry Blossom Ending"" as their favorite. Despite the band remaining inactive since 2013, its 12-year-old serenade still resonates with people, evoking images of lovers strolling beneath the cherry blossoms amid the falling petals. Respondents rated singer-songwriter Roy Kim’s “Spring, Spring, Spring,” released in 2013, as the second-most popular spring pop song, at approximately 27 percent. It is a song that utilizes spring as a trope for rekindling a past relationship. ""These songs take me back to college,"" shared Kim Joo-wan, a Seoul resident in his 30s. ""It gives me butterflies, as I used to listen to this music with my then-girlfriend."" The refrains of these songs make them worth playing again and again over the span of a decade, Kim said, heightening the excitement and romantic atmosphere of the season. As spring nears, commenters on the music video for ""Cherry Blossom Ending"" on YouTube have shared their excitement. One comment praises how the song never seems to get old, while another recent comment reads, ""Spring 2024 is on its way."" As of February this year, the music video had gotten over 28 million views on YouTube, whereas “Spring, Spring, Spring” had surpassed 34 million views. Anthems for spring's skeptics ""What the Spring??"" by 10cm ""Not Spring, Love or Cherry Blossoms” by IU and High 4 ""Do you really like spring you fools?/ Are cherry blossoms really that pretty you idiots?/ Flower petals eventually fall, I hope you all fall too/ I hope you all break up."" (""What the Spring??"") However, the hope that spring will lead to romance falls short of meeting everyone's expectations. While the top two favorite songs chosen in the survey praise the romantic essence of spring, the latter two tracks, indie band 10cm’s ""What the Spring??"" and a collaboration between singer-songwriter IU and boy band High 4 titled, ""Not Spring, Love or Cherry Blossoms,” with 7.16 percent and 5.16 percent, respectively, capture the voices of those left unloved, providing a contrasting perspective on the season. These songs bear bitter undertones and express discontent with typical images of the season of love. Such contrasting attitudes toward romantic relationships in spring are responses to popular images of spring idealizing young romance. Beneath the surface resentment toward spring and happy couples, both songs reveal an undercurrent of isolation and longing. They lament the misfortune of lacking a romantic partner with whom to share the season's joys. ""I find it amusing that some songs reflect the voices of singles,"" shared Park, a college student in her 20s. ""Many of my friends are not in a relationship, making these songs more relatable to them."" Indeed, the theme of staying single during the spring season has aroused significant sympathy among Koreans, echoing the growing trend of individuals choosing to embrace singlehood. According to a survey conducted by local pollster PMI Research and Consulting last year, which involved 3,000 singles aged between 20 to 69, nearly half of respondents said they are currently not in a relationship. Approximately 35 percent reported being in one, while close to 20 percent said that they had never been in a relationship before. However, the largest percentage of respondents -- at 33.6 percent -- stated that they feel more comfortable being alone. An official from the polling agency attributed the rising trend of singledom in modern society to individuals seeking higher life satisfaction, stronger personal values and self-realization. Kim also said that he is quite content with his life without a romantic partner, as he remains occupied with pursuing his life goals. He has been single for over a year now. ""I would be open to dating if I met someone whom I could dedicate myself to. Until then, I don't plan to actively seek out a romantic partner,"" he expressed. ""Right now, it's better for me to focus on myself."" Yet, immersing himself in the romantic ambiance of spring still brings a sense of joy, with or without a partner, he said.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/04/02/20240402050629_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
The New Six returns as full unit with Junhyeok back from 14-month break,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3352685,2024.03.20 19:19,"K-pop boy group released its first digital single, “Fuego,” its first new project in nine months. This is also the group’s full unit comeback as a group of six for the first time in 14 months with Junhyeok back with the group to promote the new digital single. Junhyeok had been taking a break from group activities since January last year due to health issues. “I want to thank the members for waiting for me and also for telling me that they need me in the team. Their support led me to practice much harder to show my best performance to be of help to the group for this comeback. Our teamwork has improved,” said Junhyeok during a press conference in Seoul on Wednesday. The New Six consists of six members: Kyungjun, Taehun, Hyunsoo, Junhyeok, Hwi and Sungjun. The group returned with a performance that was more fierce and more powerful than ever for the promotion of “Fuego.” “Fuego,” or fire in Spanish, is a bass house number. “The single is about burning away all negative feelings and thoughts such as anxiety and worries to march forward together,” explained Kyungjun. “The choreography of the single conveys diverse moves that depicts fire. It also includes a lot of group moves in which we have to show good teamwork,” said Taehun. Performing the single on stage for the first time during the press conference, The New Six showed perfectly synchronized moves that required a lot of energy. “We practiced the choreography for 10 hours daily before shooting the music video. Psy took part in our practices to point out we should improve and that helped us present a perfectly aligned performance,” said Hwi. Psy is the CEO of P Nation, the agency that houses The New Six. The single was produced by Penomeco, a renowned music producer in the K-pop scene who has worked with well-known names such as IU, Itzy, NCT U and Jessie. “Penomeco was meticulous when directing us during the recording sessions. He helped to bring out the best in each member. He even came to watch us shoot the music video for the single to support us,” added Taehun. The group plans to promote its new single through diverse content including local music shows and a fan meeting is also in the works. “We wanted to return with a high quality song and performance and also show the public and our fans that we’ve improved as artists. We hope to continue introducing music that can be appreciated and loved by the public,” said Sungjun.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/03/20/20240320050810_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
S. Korea to crack down on ticket scalping via macro tools,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3350150,2024.03.18 15:14,"The South Korean government said Monday that the recent law revision banning the use of macro tools to buy tickets will take effect Friday as part of its measures to fight widespread ticket scalping in the country. The revision of the Public Performance Act specifies that no one shall illegally buy tickets for performances by using computer programing tools for automated repetitive inputs -- the macro programs -- for the purpose of reselling them, according to the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism. Those guilty of violation could be subject to up to one year in prison or a 10 million won ($7,500) fine. ""Ticket scalping threatens the basis of the market order for our culture and sports, and we (the ministry) will take severe actions against it. ... The Culture Ministry will implement various policies that can root out and prevent ticket scalping, thus restoring the order in the distribution system of culture and sports fields,"" the Culture Ministry Yu In-chon said. Since March 2, the ministry has been operating a webpage exclusively devoted to reports related to illegal ticket sales (www.culture.go.kr/singo), which allows users to report such acts online or via phone while providing options to apply for legal consultation. It plans to work closely with the cybercrime division of the National Police Agency to crack down on the ticket scalping. The ministry also plans to hold continued meetings with those in the fields of culture and sports to discuss countermeasures against illegal ticket sales, starting with a meeting Monday at the National Theater of Korea with officials from major theaters and performance agencies across the country. Ticket scalping in South Korea has been an ongoing problem -- especially in the era of digital ticketing -- with the damages from the illegal act said to be substantial. In an interview with The Korea Herald last year, Yoon Dong-hwan, the chair of the Record Label Industry Association of Korea, said that more than 50 percent of the tickets from sold-out performances typically go to scalpers. Yoon's claim is not backed up by an official tally, but statistics do make it clear that ticket scalping in the country is on the rise. According to the Korea Creative Content Agency, the number of reports related to illegal ticket sales went from 359 in 2020 to 4,224 in 2022. A survey by the RLIAK in 2023 showed that 32.8 percent of those aged between 19 and 29 have bought a ticket from a scalper at least once, followed by 25 percent of those in their 30s and 40s. Singers across the country have been attempting to fight such illegal actions in various ways. K-pop megastar IU slaps a life-time ban from her fan club on anyone caught illegally selling a ticket to her concert, and singer Jang Beom-jun implemented a system of selling tickets as non-fungible tokens for last months' performance. Many others have a no-warning policy for canceling tickets suspected of being reserved by a ticket scalper. The revision of the performance law follows complaints that ticket scalping via bots had remained in a legal blind spot since legal punishment for such acts had only been stipulated in a law introduced half a century ago. Prior to the revision, illegal sales of tickets were only punishable by the Article 3 of the Punishment for Minor Offense Act, which does not address online sales.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/03/18/20240318050521_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

"[Herald Review] IU sets off on first world tour, 'H.E.R'",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3343931,2024.03.11 15:48,"Singer promises encore concert in September at Seoul World Cup Stadium IU’s voice rippled through the KSPO Dome on Sunday as the lights dimmed to open the singer-songwriter’s final Seoul concert of her first world tour, ""H.E.R.,"" which took place in the capital on March 2-3 and March 9-10. Reminiscent of dandelion spores, IU appeared from the ceiling wearing a glittering headset and slowly descended toward the stage, silently surrounded by her audience. When she landed on the stage to perform “Holssi,” meaning spore in Korean, the lights shone on the stage and spread outwards like petals, transforming like a blooming flower. “Today the venue seems to be hotter than usual. I know the weather is getting warm but I think it’s your energy that is creating this heat,” said IU. The artist’s show was divided into five parts, each with a different theme. IU charmed the nearly 14,000-strong audience during the first ""hypnotic"" part of the show. Then, a little girl wearing a white dress and holding a lantern appeared on stage as it filled with fog. The girl wandered around, lost in the woods until a golden path appeared in front of her, at the end of which stood IU. IU proceeded to perform “Celebrity” which seemed to tell the little girl, who symbolized the singer's listeners, that even though she feels lost at the moment, she will soon find her way to achieve her dream. “Now, I’m going to sing ‘Blueming’ for which I want you to put down your cameras and phones, and focus on this moment with me,” IU asked her fans. The singer's fans sang along with the artists, almost as if they had practiced it beforehand. “The next song is ‘I stan U,’ and I wrote this song thinking about you guys. I wanted to tell you that just as you cheer for me on stage, I also hope to be that kind of audience for you,” the artist said, expressing her affection toward her fans. “I also have this special fan light designed just for me. Don’t forget that, whenever life is harsh to you, IU is cheering for you with this fan light.” During the last of her four concerts at the KSPO Dome in Seoul, actor Park Bo-geum was invited to the stage as a guest performer. “He is a dear friend of mine who is not a singer but sings just as well as a singer and is unbelievably handsome,” said IU as she introduced Park to her fans. IU became friends with the actor while shooting the Netflix series “When Life Gives You Tangerines” last year. Park performed IU’s “Not Spring, Love, or Cherry Blossoms” and Jukjae’s “Let’s Go See the Stars.” Guest artists at the singer's first three concerts were NewJeans, Riize and Le Sserafim. IU transformed the mood by performing her ballad “Through the Night,” immersing her fans in a mellow and cozy atmosphere. “I think this song will be included in all of the set lists for my future concerts. That’s how much I love this song and it’s so soothing when we sing it together. I hope this moment comes to your mind before you go to sleep,” said the artist. The concert hit its climax when IU performed “Shopper,” the lead track of her latest EP, “The Winning.” The sound of the audience singing along to the artist was deafening. Tweety Bird, the famous yellow canary character from the animated cartoon, “Looney Tunes,” with whom IU collaborated to promote her new album, appeared on the screens around IU, making it seem as if the character was performing on stage alongside the singer. The singer also announced that she will be holding an encore concert in Seoul at the Seoul World Cup Stadium on Sep. 21-22. She will be the first female Korean artist to hold a standalone concert at the Seoul World Cup Stadium. “This is my first world tour and it’s both exciting and nerve-racking to perform in so many cities around the world in front of so many fans. I am taking on new challenges in my 30s. I will see you at the Seoul World Cup Stadium in September. It will be different from this concert and there will be more seats available,” said IU.

IU adds her own definition of ‘winning’ into 6th EP 'The Winning',https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3330605,2024.02.20 14:57,"Singer-songwriter and actor IU thinks living a successful life, or ""winning"" as she calls it, does not always have to be about making a lot of money or living a life everyone looks up to. Instead, through her sixth EP, ""The Winning,"" the artist shares her own definition of “winning,” which she says is accepting the fact that not everyone blooms into a flower. The new EP was released Tuesday. On the day of her new album release, IU posted a video on her official YouTube channel in which, sitting down on a couch, she introduces her album as if talking to a friend. “I decided to live as a spore. I was inspired by the word 'spore' when making this album,” said IU. ""Holssi"" is spore in Korean, and also the title for one of the two lead tracks in her new album. “When I was young, I thought I would bloom into a flower. But now that I’m 30 years old, I rather accept the fact that I could live as a spore, but do my best to live an awesome life as a spore. I continuously asked myself what is a successful life for a spore in this album,” the artist explained. “Shopper,” the other lead track on the album, is about dreaming big even when the goal seems impossible. “(Through this track) I wanted to tell people to aspire (for their dreams) with confidence. Even though others might judge your dream as weird, there is no reason for you to limit your aspiration,” IU said. IU’s sixth EP carries a total of five tracks, with IU herself writing the lyrics for the songs, adding in her own thoughts and experiences. “This album could have been delayed even more because the drama I've been shooting is taking longer than expected. But I wanted to push myself. My fans have been waiting for so long and I also thought it was time for me to release a new album,” she said. The album is IU's first comeback in more than two years.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/02/20/20240220050537_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

NABR Files Expanded Petition Challenging the Listing of Long-Tailed Macaques by the IUCN,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3318416,2024.02.02 10:31,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Working with recognized, independent scientists, the National Association for Biomedical Research (NABR) filed an expanded petition today with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) challenging the designation of the long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) as ""endangered"" or ""vulnerable"" under IUCN listing criteria. On October 12, 2023, the IUCN Standards and Petitions Committee accepted NABR's initial petition challenging the IUCN's 2022 designation of long-tailed macaques as ""endangered."" NABR's initial petition, filed with the IUCN on September 11, 2023, concluded that the underlying scientific justification for the Endangered listing is ""biased"" and ""not based upon the best available scientific information."" Prior to July 2022, long-tailed macaques were designated as ""vulnerable"" by the IUCN. In 2022, the IUCN revised its designation to ""endangered"" based upon a scientific review published by Hansen et al. (2022).1 The expanded NABR petition now calls for the IUCN to vacate both the ""endangered"" and ""vulnerable"" listings until ""a new status assessment of M. fascicularis is conducted by truly independent scientists not involved in advocacy roles for the target species."" The expanded NABR petition follows a recent publication in The American Journal of Primatology, a prominent scientific journal, that reviews scientific information used to determine the conservation status of the long-tailed macaque.2 This publication concludes that ""none of the published literature cited to support the IUCN listing as Endangered presents any data to support the hypothesized decline, nor does the literature establish that the species is at risk of becoming extinct."" ""The NABR scientific review team is pleased that the IUCN Standards and Petitions Committee will now objectively review this matter,"" stated Dr. Ray Hilborn, a world-renowned scientist and member of NABR's scientific review team. ""Given the misrepresentation of the data that has occurred in the 2022 and 2020 assessments, we expect that the IUCN Standards and Petitions Committee will agree with our conclusions"" added Dr. Hilborn. The submission of NABR's expanded petition initiates a formal process with the IUCN Standards and Petitions Committee to review available scientific information concerning the species' status under IUCN protocols. Long-tailed macaques are the most widely used non-rodent species for drug development as well as for drug safety and efficacy testing. They are also extensively used in cancer research, immunology science, regenerative medicine and genetic disease research. Long-tailed macaques are considered as an invasive species in many countries and regions including Hong Kong3, Indonesia4,5, Mauritius6, Papua New Guinea,7 and Thailand8. For decades, Asian and African countries have bred specific pathogen free long tailed macaques and exported them to the United States and other countries for biomedical research in laboratories. ""The NABR petition and 2023 article published in The American Journal of Primatology demonstrate that long-tailed macaques are neither endangered nor vulnerable, but rather a highly invasive species that thrives in the majority of countries where they live,"" stated Matthew R. Bailey, president of the National Association for Biomedical Research. ""We call upon the IUCN Standards and Petitions Committee to vacate the improper listing of this species as either endangered or vulnerable and undertake a new status assessment of this species by independent scientists.""

IU to unveil 6th EP ‘The Winning’ next month,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3315439,2024.01.30 14:50,"Singer-songwriter and actress IU will release her sixth mini album, “The Winning,” on Feb. 20, according to Edam Entertainment. The artist’s new album is the first in two years and two months after the release of her special extended play, “Pieces,"" in December 2021. The teaser clip of IU’s upcoming album uploaded to her official YouTube channel shows the artist with long bleached hair, wearing a red outfit. IU is seen spraying a red-colored spray at the camera and gazing into the camera against a light green background. The artist had hinted when she starred in Suga of BTS’ show, “Suchwita,” that her mini album is likely to carry five to six tracks that she will continue to infuse with stories about her age. Prior to the official release of her new album, IU dropped a single from the upcoming album, “Love Wins All,” on Jan. 24. The single shot to No. 1 on major local music charts such as Melon, Genie and Bugs, within just an hour of its release, which is the fastest achievement recorded by a female artist since August 2021. The much-anticipated music video for “Love Wins All,” featuring V of BTS, has surpassed 30 million views on YouTube as of Tuesday. However, the music video faced controversy as some argued that it demeaned those with disabilities. In the music video, IU is depicted as having a hearing impairment and V a visual impairment. They both run away from a cube-shaped spacecraft that symbolizes oppression and discrimination. IU and V then find a camcorder, through the filter of which they are able to view each other as people without disabilities. Some argued that these scenes are based on discriminatory views that people with disabilities necessarily admire and fantasize about being people without disabilities.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/01/30/20240130000555_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
"K-pop stars use NFT, fan reward systems to fight ticket scalping",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3313205,2024.01.26 11:58,"With ticket scalping plaguing the local music scene, South Korean singers are adopting various methods to prevent fans from having to pay extortionate sums for concert tickets. Singer Jang Beom-jun recently announced that the ticket sales for his concert next month will be using the blockchain system, with the tickets being sold as non-fungible tokens that cannot be sold to anyone but the initial buyer. Jang had sold out the concert scheduled for this month, but cancelled all reservations due to ticket scalping. Prior to her year-end concert last year, K-pop megastar IU implemented a system where a person illegally selling a ticket would be banned for life from her fan club, and the person who reported such activity would get the ticket instead. Sung Si-kyung, who held his year-end concert on Dec. 29-31, sold many of his tickets on-site, ensuring that each person buys one ticket only. He took to Instagram to urge fans not to buy tickets illegally, saying it would lead to cancellation and more tickets being available for sale on-site. Several singers have a no-warning policy for cancelling tickets suspected of being reserved by ticket scalpers, including Lim Young-woong who recently cancelled 118 reservations for his Jan. 19-21 concert. It has been reported that his tickets, the priciest of which is 160,000 won ($120), have been resold for as much as 5 million won. Ticket scalping has long been an issue ailing the local music industry, with a Record Label Industry Association of Korea survey showing that 32.8 percent of those aged 19-29 have bought a ticket from a scalper at least once. The group suspects that about half of the tickets for sold-out performances go to ticket scalpers. South Korea recently revised the Public Performance Act to specify that buying tickets with targeted software -- or macros -- is illegal. But there have been calls for a more comprehensive revision to stop the illegal ticket sales, most of which occur online and have long been in a legal blind spot as the related law was passed 50 years ago.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/01/26/20240126000423_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Korean dramas depicting countryside youth enjoy bump in popularity,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3306983,2024.01.22 15:11,"The end of 2023 and start of 2024 have been flooded with South Korean dramas depicting the lives of youth who lead their lives in countryside, amid the increase in demand from the audience for stress relief, according to experts, Monday. ""Welcome to Samdal-ri,"" a popular 16-part JTBC romantic comedy drama, which released its first episode on Dec. 2, 2023, wrapped up with its last episode on Sunday. The drama series narrates the story of Cho Sam-dal (played by Shin Hye-sun), who lived in Seoul for 18 years and returned to her hometown of Jeju Island, after a mishap in the workplace. The drama series' last episode logged a viewership rating of 12.4 percent, according to Nielson Korea, breaking its 15th episodes' viewership rating record of 10.4 percent. ""Boyhood,"" a 10-part drama series which exclusively aired on Coupang Play from Nov. 24, 2023 to Dec. 22, 2023, also gained popularity, depicting the coming-of-age story of Jang Byung-tae (played by Im Si-wan), a high school student from Buyeo, South Chungcheong Province. After the release of ""Boyhood"" on Nov. 24 on the streaming service, the series was ranked as the most popular title on Coupang Play for five consecutive weeks. Cable channel ENA also released a 12-part drama series titled ""Like Flowers in Sand,"" on Dec. 20, 2023, set against the backdrop of the fictional region of Geosan in South Gyeongsang Province. The story focuses on the story of Kim Baek-doo (played by Jang Dong-yoon), who aims to become a wrestling athlete on a sandpit. The drama series is scheduled to air its last episode on Thursday. Riding on the trend for works portraying the lives of young people in Korea's rural areas, Netflix is also scheduled to release the 16-part original ""You Have Done Well."" According to Netflix, the official release date is yet to be set. The star-studded cast of the new drama series includes actors Lee Ji-eun, also known as IU, and Park Bo-gum. The drama will focus on the stories of young people who live on Jeju Island during the 1950s. Pop culture critic Jeong Ji-wook said constant releases of drama series focusing on the lives of young people in regions other than Seoul follows the growing demand of audiences for stress relief. ""Following the outbreak of the pandemic, people here were very stressed. When everything became hard and it wasn't clear what to do or how to solve anything (content creators) attempted to offer some kind of 'healing code.' With such factors, it seems that the characteristics of countryside, along with love and growth stories of young people, have contributed to the creation of such titles,"" he said. He added that through such works, the audience is able to satisfy their cravings to experience a new environment. ""The works also deal with settings that are not routinely seen but rather unique and atmospheric. The works depict entertaining episodes within a distinctive and captivating scenery, which inspire curiosity from the audience,"" said Jeong.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/01/22/20240122000570_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
IU renames new single ‘Love Wins All’ in response to queerbaiting allegations,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3306528,2024.01.21 14:41,"K-pop artist IU has changed the title of her upcoming single from “Love Wins” to “Love Wins All” after a backlash from sexual minorities and fans alleging queerbaiting. “We recognized that the original title of the single could blur the message of the song. We would like to respect and support everyone who loves and lives in various ways,” said Edam Entertainment, the agency representing IU, in a press release on Friday. The agency revealed on Thursday the IU’s handwritten introduction of the upcoming single in which the singer-actor explained that “Love Wins” stems from her journey of overcoming hate directed at her with the love and support of her fans. But the title, “Love Wins,” raised concerns about queerbaiting. Queerbaiting is the practice of implying non-heterosexual relationships to engage or attract an LGBTQ+ audience without explicitly depicting such relationships or interactions, only to take advantage of and capitalize on the ambiguous possibility of LGBTQ+ representation. “Love Wins,” is a hashtag that started trending in 2015 when the US Supreme Court announced its decision to guarantee the right of same-sex couples to marry. The hashtag has since been used to commemorate the victory of marriage equality. “If there is a word that is exactly the opposite to the message of the single, it would be ‘hatred.’ We sincerely hope that all love will win in a world without hate, and that the meaning of this song will be conveyed without hurting anyone,” the agency added. “Love Wins All,” set for release on Jan. 24, is a much-anticipated single featuring V of BTS. V also stars in the music video for the single.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/01/21/20240121000102_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

Man jailed in K-pop concert ticket scam,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3304690,2024.01.16 14:15,"A 30-year-old South Korean man who pretended to sell tickets for K-pop concerts and swindled 595 million won ($450,000) from his victims has been sentenced to six years in prison, a court said Tuesday. The Seoul Central District Court found the defendant, surnamed Kim, guilty on multiple counts of fraud. An investigation found that Kim had pretended to sell tickets for concerts of popular artists here including IU, Blackpink and Lim Young-woong, some 130 times, pocketing the profits from the sales and refusing to deliver the tickets to those who had purchased them. Kim had also obtained loans using the credit cards of his victims, based on the information that he acquired during a scam selling fake IU concert tickets. In addition to the concert ticket scam, Kim is also accused of conducting scams involving musical tickets, cameras, gift certificates for a local department store and video game currency. ""The defendant continued to go on scamming his victims even while he was being tried for fraud, and used the profits for gambling and making cryptocurrency investments. (The court) has decided that he should receive a punishment on par with (the severity of) his crime,"" the court said in its verdict. Kim has appealed the ruling. The South Korean music industry has been impacted by ticket scalping of popular artists, which sees fans paying a premium to see their favorite artists. The Record Label Industry Association of Korea recently conducted a survey which suggested that 32.8 percent of those aged between 19 and 29 have bought a ticket from a scalper at least once, with 20 percent of the age group saying they had spent more than 500,000 won on a ticket. Lim Young-woong's agency recently said it canceled 118 ticket reservations for his Jan 19-21 concert, saying they were suspected to have been reserved by ticket scalpers. Lim's tickets, the priciest of which is 160,000 won, has been sold for as much as 1 million won by the scalpers. Singer Jang Beom-june, who had been scheduled to hold 10 concerts in January and February, canceled all ticket reservations due to ticket scalping. He later posted that he will hold an online raffle for the rights to buy his tickets, limiting each person to the purchase of one ticket.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/01/16/20240116000527_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
"IU, G-Dragon to come back to K-pop in 2024",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3294017,2024.01.02 17:10,"Legendary soloists are returning with new albums for the new year. Singer-songwriter IU is set to drop her first new album in two years. She has been focusing on her acting career since releasing special mini album ""Pieces"" in December 2021, but confirmed her return as a singer this year. Appearing on BTS bandmate Suga's YouTube talk show ""Suchwita"" on Dec. 26 last year, IU said she will hold her first overseas concert tour in four years, since the ""Love, Poem"" tour in 2019. Through her personal YouTube channel, IU said she will be leaving the country in January to finish her new album. She had already filmed the new song’s music video with V of BTS. IU, who debuted 16 years ago, became the first K-pop female solo artist to hold a standalone gig at Seoul's Olympic Stadium, one of the nation's biggest concert venues. She is also currently filming Netflix series ""You Have Done Well."" G-Dragon, who was recently vindicated of allegations involving illegal drug use, founded an agency and officially confirmed his return. G-Dragon has not released a new album since his second mini album, ""Kwon Ji Yong"" in 2017, due to various controversies surrounding his group Big Bang and his military service. As of the end of last year, all his Big Bang bandmates had also left YG Entertainment. G-Dragon's new agency, Galaxy Corp., held a press conference on Dec. 21, 2023, and announced the artist’s plan to establish an anti-drug foundation -- JusPeace Foundation -- as well as his comeback to the music scene. “I will make a comeback to fulfill my responsibilities as an artist as well as my social responsibilities,” said G-Dragon through a statement issued at the press conference. Meanwhile, Korean legend Cho Yong-pil will return with his 20th full-length album. For Cho, also widely known as “Gawang” -- the king of pop music in Korean -- 2024 will mark 56 years since his debut. Originally, the 20th full-length album was scheduled to be released in 2023 to mark the 55th anniversary, but it is said to have been delayed due to his efforts to make the perfect album. Prior to the 20th full-length album, Cho Yong-pil released two preview albums in the last couple years, ""Road to 20 – Prelude 1"" and ""Road to 20 – Prelude 2,"" in November 2022 and April 2023, respectively. He also held large concerts at Seoul Olympic Stadium and the KSPO Dome last year.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/01/02/20240102000733_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Saving Species Challenge Attracts Global Interest,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3291687,2023.12.29 05:10,"52 applicants in the running for $1 million INDIANAPOLIS, Dec. 29, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The Indianapolis Zoo's bold new conservation initiative will award $1 million to a single organization working to save a species from extinction. The Saving Species Challenge has attracted the interest of conservationists representing 52 species in 46 nations. Each applicant has developed a detailed plan that, if funded, will have a measurable and sustainable impact on the survival of a threatened animal species. The Indianapolis Zoo launched the Saving Species Challenge in April with the goal of funding a plan with the potential to improve the status of species that is currently designated as threatened (Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable or Extinct in the Wild) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List. The announcement of the 52 applicants comes on the 50th anniversary of the Endangered Species Act in the United States, which has given legal protection to hundreds of species. ""We focus on our mission of protecting nature and inspiring people to care for our world. The Saving Species Challenge is a solid investment in protecting and preserving the diversity of life on Earth,"" said Dr. Robert Shumaker, President & CEO of the Indianapolis Zoo. Conservationists at the Global Center for Species Survival reviewed nearly 200 pre-applications before inviting 79 organizations to submit full applications. The decision of who will be awarded the $1 million Saving Species Challenge grant rests in the hands of a jury of international animal conservationists. ""We were inspired by the quality of the applications we received. I wish we had $52 million dollars to fund every single one of these conservation action plans,"" said Bill Street, Indianapolis Zoo Senior Vice President and Director of the Global Center for Species Survival. Challenge applications not only represent strong geographic diversity, but also biological diversity. Applicants submitted plans to improve the conservation status of 7 amphibians, 17 birds, 3 fish, 3 insects, 12 mammals and 10 reptiles. The Saving Species Challenge is modeled after a concept developed by experts at the IUCN Species Survival Commission. ""Reverse the Red"" aims to downlist species that are assessed on the IUCN Red List. For example, if a species is currently listed as Extinct in the Wild, downlisting it to Critically Endangered would signify an improvement in the species' chance of survival. The winner of the Indianapolis Zoo Saving Species Challenge will have five years to implement their program and show progress. The Zoo will announce the winner in the spring of 2024.

IU seeks compensation for plagiarism accusation,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3288093,2023.12.21 17:31,"Singer-actor IU recently launched a civil lawsuit seeking compensation from an individual who raised plagiarism allegations against her, as local media outlets on Thursday reported that South Korean police have submitted the information related to the individual to court. The 31-year-old singer has been engaged in a legal battle seeking compensation for what her representatives claimed was defamation via groundless acts of slander. After investigators cleared her of plagiarism allegations in September, her agency, Edam Entertainment, filed charges against the individual who raised the suspicions. ""We (the agency) are currently checking the information (of the accuser) in accordance with the law, and cannot disclose the details as of yet,"" the agency said, adding that it will not tolerate attacks against the singer. IU is seeking 30 million won ($23,000) in compensation for damages she claims were caused by the allegations. In May, the singer-songwriter was accused of plagiarizing other people's work in six of her songs. The legal authorities, however, decided that that accusations do not constitute a criminal charge. While IU was the singer of the six songs in question, she participated in composing only one of them. That song was not included in the copyright violation allegations.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/12/21/20231221000702_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

IU's agency, Edam Entertainment, confirmed that she wrapped up filming the music video with V on Tuesday. The new album is likely to be released within the first half of 2024. V appeared as a guest on IU's official YouTube channel in September, showing their close friendship. The new music video was directed by Um Tae-hwa, who directed the 2023 film “Concrete Utopia.” Um was also in charge of directing the video played during IU's 10th anniversary concert in 2018. It is the first time in two years that IU has released a new album since the special mini album ""Pieces"" in December 2021. The album was a collection of self-composed songs that had never been officially released. Meanwhile, V is set to begin his mandatory military service on Dec. 11.

[Rising Virtuosos] Multitalented pianist Kim Song-hyeon pursues his potential,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3276176,2023.12.07 18:11,"Second-prize winner of Isangyun Competition releases debut album “Potential” When pianist Kim Song-hyeon participated in the Isangyun Competition in early November, he saw the waters of Tongyeong and prayed to become tranquil just like the sea. Before the final round, he re-read messages of encouragement from Paik Hae-sun, a prominent South Korean pianist and his teacher at the New England Conservatory. Paik, who had flown to Korea for her own performance, came straight to Tongyeong from Incheon Airport after a 20-hour flight to cheer on her student. The 21-year-old performed Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor, Op. 23, the same piece for which Paik had taken home the third prize from the International Tchaikovsky Competition in 1994. Once Kim finished playing, a standing ovation erupted and he sobbed uncontrollably while exiting the stage. “Participating in competitions is a high-pressure experience. The stage of evaluation adds to the intensity, as all my efforts over the past few months reach their end. When I saw the audience giving me a standing ovation, my emotions exploded,” Kim told The Korea Herald during an interview on Nov. 6. Kim had left the Isangyun Competition empty-handed in 2019. This time, he demonstrated significant progress by exiting triumphantly with three awards, including the second prize and the Seong-ywang Park Special Prize, which was awarded by the Kumho Culture Foundation. The third prize is the UNESCO Creative City of Music Special Prize, which is decided by an audience vote, and is a type of award that he is familiar with. At the Sendai International Music Competition in 2022, he won both fifth prize and the Audience Prize. So, what happened to Kim between the 2019 and 2023 competitions? Kim said studying under Paik had been advantageous for him. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, with the help of my teacher, I was able to focus on lessons and practice. In addition to her piano lessons, I learned a lot of life lessons from her -- from her devotion to music, her students and the people around her.” Kim said he is so lucky to have met great teachers. Interestingly, his teachers are not strangers to each other. His first teacher introduced Kim to her own teacher, who introduced him, in turn, to her teacher. He was referring to Kang Hye-young, Shin Soo-jung and Paik. Kang’s high-school teacher is Shin and her college teacher is Paik. In addition, Shin, former dean of Seoul National University's College of Music, introduced Kim to pianist Lee Jin-sang. Right now, Kim studies with Paik, who is the reason he originally applied to the NEC. “What I learned from her is to abandon my desire to express myself. ‘Music is greater than you. Once you realize that you can be free.’ So every time she teaches, she tells me, 'Don’t try to impress me. Just think about the music.'” Perhaps Paik underscores this teaching while recognizing Kim as a young man endowed not only with a broad spectrum of interests but also with diverse talents. Just like his idol, IU, the K-pop singer who sings, writes songs and acts, Kim loves writing, drawing, reading and taking photos, and when he was in elementary school, he was into inventing things and won several awards. Perhaps because of the influences that he received both consciously and subconsciously, he also thinks about pursuing a teacher/performer career just like Paik. The audience prizes he received from the Isangyun Competition and the Sendai International Music Competition in the past two years and other stages where he experienced a strong connection with the audience made him lean toward discovering his potential as a concert pianist. ""At Sendai, I thought, 'Perhaps I have something to move people's minds,' and I could clearly feel the audience’s energy from the stage, which made me gain more strength and play with more vigor,” he added. In his pursuit of both his personal potential as a pianist and potential of the piano, he would like to release an album each year, a plan that commenced with his debut album, titled “Potential,” which came out this month. The album includes piano renditions of Liszt’s ""Reminiscences de Norma,"" S. 394, and Bartok’s ""Sandor Concerto for Orchestra,"" Sz. 116. Its release is timed to honor the premiere of Bartok’s composition on Dec. 1, 1944, in Boston. “At this final, I realized performing and inspiring the audience gives me great joy. I have this growing desire to take the stage together with fellow pianists that I admire and become their peer,” he said, adding that Korean pianists Son Yeol-eum and Sunwoo Ye-kwon are his role models. This article is the fourth in the ""Rising Virtuosos"" series introducing Korea's next generation of talented and accomplished classical musicians. The series will give readers an intimate look at the exceptional artistry and passion of young musicians who are making their mark on the international classical music scene. —Ed.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/12/07/20231207000724_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Relais & Châteaux chefs pledge to stop serving eel with immediate effect to prevent its extinction,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3274792,2023.12.05 20:10,"Working in concert with Ethic Ocean, the Association's World Culinary Council will lobby European ministers to protect biodiversity PARIS, Dec. 5, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The members of Relais & Châteaux's World Culinary Council has voted to immediately remove eel from their own menus and are sending a call to action to the rest of the group's 580 hotels and restaurants to do the same, after its NGO partner Ethic Ocean launched an alert that public authorities must urgently listen to scientists who recommend suspending European eel fishing. To view the Multimedia News Release, please click: https://www.multivu.com/players/uk/9230451-relais-chateaux-chefs-pledge-stop-serving-eel-prevent-extinction/ The European eel (Anguilla anguilla), which is featured in menus all over the world–and revered in certain French, Spanish, Belgian, Dutch and Japanese culinary cultures–is considered critically endangered and features on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Over the last 20 years, European scientists from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) have been warning about all the causes of the alarming decline of this species–but for the last three years, they have recommended suspending fishing. In this context, the 21 Relais & Châteaux chefs elected to the Association's World Culinary Council gathered in October and voted to approve an immediate ban of European eel from its menus. In partnership with Ethic Ocean, Relais & Châteaux calls on the 27 European Union ministers to hear this chef mobilization and scientific recommendation in order to take the necessary measures this December to safeguard this species. The effort follows a similar approach taken by the Association, in 2009, to save the bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) stocks in the North-East Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, which were close to collapsing. This action contributed to public mobilization around this species, which encouraged legislators to enact management measures adapted to the situation of the state of the stock. A Variety of Issues The situation with eels is very alarming because this species suffers from a numerous challenges including water pollution (particularly rivers), habitat destruction, dams that impede their biological cycle and illegal fishing, which has created a black market, fetching up to €5,000 per kilo. Eels are the only fish that are targeted at their juvenile stage, on top of the fact that it takes them a long time to reach reproductive maturity. While it is urgent to suspend eel fishing today, it is crucial that the public authorities take the necessary measures to fight against the other causes of the decline of this species. Mauro Colagreco, Vice President, Chefs of Relais & Châteaux and therefore leader of the World Culinary Council, and chef-owner of the three-Michelin-starred restaurant Mirazur in the South of France, said, ""Chefs have a critical role to play: we can stop the demand. We have a chance to protect eels from becoming extinct, and of preserving biodiversity to allow future generations to continue to enjoy them, but only if we act now. As the world's largest network of chefs, Relais & Châteaux hopes to save this species."" Gastronomy: Dependent on Nature The World Culinary Council–an international committee of 21 chefs from across the Relais & Châteaux network–had gathered over October 8-10, 2023, under the Association's president, Laurent Gardinier. Laurent Gardinier said: ""We have an acute understanding that Relais & Châteaux, and our very art de vivre, is dependent on nature. We must lead in sustainability to protect the ecosystems and biodiversity that our culinary and travel experiences rely on. It is these experiences that move our guests emotionally. And this would not be possible without nature."" A Vehicle for Change The World Culinary Council wishes to draw attention to the plight of eels. Relais & Châteaux has had a partnership with Ethic Ocean since 2009 and regularly unites its members around actions in favor of the environment, especially marine biodiversity (for example, World Oceans Day). Gilles Boeuf, president of Ethic Ocean, said, ""I am happy to see the Relais & Châteaux association support this alert, which aims, above all, to preserve an exceptional species that reflects humanity's relationship with the environment. This cause to save the eel touches on many biodiversity issues. Let's act before it's too late.""

Scalpers take bigger cut of Korean music industry,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3274308,2023.12.05 16:28,"Law revision sought to establish legal grounds for punishing ticket reselling Kim Yeon-soo, 27, was able to get her hands on a resale ticket for her favorite artist's concert, but at twice the regular price. “I wanted to see the concert so badly, I searched social media and resale websites. Hundreds of tickets were up for sale at ridiculous prices,"" said Kim, an office worker. ""It's upsetting to give money to scalpers who take advantage of fans’ desperation, but I didn’t have a choice."" Ticket scalpers are one of the biggest headaches for the Korean music industry, including musicals and classical music. Although scalpers have always been an issue, the problem has grown in size and scope, and ticket scalping has turned into a lucrative business. ""More than 50 percent of the tickets for sold-out performances typically go to scalpers. Sometimes they take up more than 70 percent of the seats,"" said Yoon Dong-hwan, the chairman of the Record Label Industry Association of Korea, who recently filed a petition for an amendment of the law to confront the ticket scalping problem. Yoon pointed out that the introduction of macros has accelerated the growth of the ticket resale industry. Macros are automatic systems that can go through the multiple steps of purchasing a ticket in seconds. Ordinary consumers without such a program cannot compete with the speed of macro. Scalpers make a profit by selling tickets to fans who are willing to pay an extra fee through resale sites or social media. On Ticket Bay, one of the most well-known reselling platforms, tickets for a popular boy group The Boyz concert were trading at up to 7,000,000 won ($5,410) as of last Thursday, while VIP seats for one of the best-loved ballad singers Sung Si-kyung's concert were trading at up to 1,199,900 won. The original price of each ticket is about 150,000 won. Scalpers have come up with ingenious ways to avoid crackdowns. To pass the identification check, the sellers claim the tickets in person at the ticket booth and hand them over to the buyers just before entering the performance venue. Some scalpers cancel their tickets at a prearranged time, allowing buyers to rebook them quickly and safely enter the concert venue with the ticket reserved under their name. Others attract buyers before tickets open, advertising ticket proxy purchase services using macros. Yoon pointed out that ticket resale has now become an industry, organized and systematized. From people who buy tickets running macros to people who sell tickets on social media or secondhand trading sites and people who meet buyers and deliver tickets in person, there is a division of labor. Most of the accounts used by scalpers on ticket sales platforms are purchased from third parties that are not related to the scalpers. While resellers continue to evolve, the legal system has not kept up with the changes. Under the current law, illegal ticket transactions refer only to transactions made in specific places, such as stadiums and performance venues. Online transactions, which account for the absolute majority of ticket resales, are not subject to punishment. As criticisms mount, some singers and entertainment agencies have taken matters into their own hands. Singer IU has introduced a system that gives tickets to people who report inappropriate transactions while Sung Si-kyung caught a scalper with his manager posing as a buyer. However, such attempts only filter out very few cases. Discussions on preventing scalping have spread to the political arena. At a parliamentary audit last month, Rep. Ryu Ho-jeong of the minor progressive Justice Party called on the Korea Creative Content Agency to actively operate an anti-scalping center. According to the KCCA data that Rep. Ryu submitted, the number of ticket scalping reports increased sharply after COVID-19 pandemic, from 359 in 2020 to 785 in 2021 and 4,224 in 2022. On Nov. 25, the Ministry of Justice converted the Record Label Industry Association of Korea's petition for an amendment of the scalping law to an open petition, starting the 30-day discussion period when public opinions are gathered. The result of the discussion will be announced within 90 days of the discussion period. The petition urged a speedy revision to the anti-scalping law, stressing that the law has never been revised since it was enacted some 50 years ago. “The law revision will provide the legal grounds for cracking down scalpers and expanding social discussion on the inappropriate ticket resale industry overall,” said Yoo.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/12/05/20231205000609_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Huawei Sustainability Forum: Jeffrey Sachs Advocates Tech Solutions to Address SDG Challenges,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3270158,2023.11.29 10:50,"SHENZHEN, China, Nov. 29, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Huawei's 2023 Sustainability Forum and its regional sessions concluded yesterday. Themed ""Thriving Together with Tech: Realizing Sustainable Development,"" the event involved five regional sessions in China, Italy, Ghana, Pakistan, and Brazil, where best sustainability practices from Huawei and its partners were demonstrated. In Brazil, Huawei is working with local operator Veloso Net to deliver stable connectivity to over 30% of the unconnected population in the state of Amazonas. Huawei also announced plans to cooperate with the International Union for Nature Conservation (IUCN) to implement a Tech4Nature project, which will protect biodiversity while fostering the development of local communities. At the main forum in Dongguan, China, Jeffrey Sachs, President of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, Commissioner of the UN Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development, and Professor at Columbia University, delivered a keynote speech in which he discussed how global challenges are becoming increasingly complex. ""We live in a period in which the challenges are getting greater and the need for breakthrough technologies, such as those Huawei brings us, is ever more urgent."" Sachs highlighted the vital role that digital technology has to play. ""Technologies, at least potentially, can reach everybody in a society and can even reach the poorest people in the world, as long as they are near a base station, as long as they can get digital connectivity, and as long as they have a device."" Attendees emphasized that digital technology would help improve the resilience of both nature and humanity in the face of risks and challenges and drive sustainability. Jeffrey Zhou, Huawei President of ICT Marketing, noted: ""Together with our partners, we are using the power of digital technology to drive digital inclusion and enable an inclusive and sustainable digital world."" In Yunnan, China, improved connectivity enabled by Huawei's 5G solutions has increased the efficiency of coffee farming and the quality of the beans. With digital infrastructure in place, e-commerce and video streaming have boomed, elevating the local coffee industry and making local coffee a prized brand among consumers. In Italy, Huawei's TECH4ALL Nature Guardian project, in partnership with WWF Italy, has deployed cloud- and AI-based acoustic monitoring systems at 16 eco-farms and traditional farms. The project found out that approximately 10% more species live within eco-farms than in traditional farms. In Gokina, Pakistan, Huawei and its partners have brought connectivity to the local community, enabling telemedicine and distance education. Villagers in this remote village can now access quality medical services when they need them. In Ghana, Huawei worked with partners to build the first floating hydro-solar hybrid plant in West Africa. The plant will fuel a cashew factory in the Bono Region and create employment for over 800 citizens including women. The First Lady of the Republic of Ghana, Her Excellency Rebecca Akufo-Addo, appreciated Huawei's contribution to the country's sustainable development. She said: ""The world is going green and projects such as the hydro-solar hybrid plant show that Ghana is on the right path, towards the realization of a sustainable and eco-friendly digital future.""

Unauthorized AI-generated music sparks copyright debates,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3250937,2023.11.05 13:56,"First released in August 2022, K-pop girl group NewJeans' ""Hype Boy"" is gaining popularity once again thanks to a rendition ""sung"" by well-known 61-year-old rock singer Yim Jae-beom. But Yim didn't actually record the cover, an AI program generated the song that sounds like Yim singing it. Some of Yim's fans were surprised by how accurate artificial intelligence was able to mimic the singer's voice, down to the exact way he breathes, pauses and sighs. ""It was something that I hadn't expected before. I very much enjoyed it,"" said Hwang Chan-hui, 29, speaking of Yim's AI version of ""Hype Boy"" on YouTube. “Of course, I know NewJeans is amazing, but my favorite (singer) is Yim Jae-beom. His husky voice drives me crazy. I’ve wished that Yim would release more diverse albums but he didn’t, which makes me a little sad."" AI-generated music has gained immense popularity in South Korea on platforms like YouTube and Instagram. Hundreds of creators are using the technology to re-create existing tracks with other artists' voices. The more unexpected the combination, the more interest it garners. However, this trend often involves the unauthorized use of an artist's voice and music. While AI-generated music creators argue that their work should be viewed as a form of artistic expression apart from business considerations, some creators are reaping benefits -- albeit not directly from their AI works. Spot-AI-fy, a YouTube channel that specializes in AI-generated music, carries a total of 235 video clips on the platform. Launched in May 13, the videos have recorded over 17.3 million views as of Sunday. The videos on the channel are AI songs created by Sorisori, an AI-based music generation service, featuring the likes of what sounds like Ariana Grande singing a Korean song to an AI cover of IU singing ""Cupid"" by Fifty Fifty. For the monthly subscription fee of 14,800 won, or $9.99 on the English website, subscribers can generate up to 200 tracks of music using AI. There are growing voices that AI music creators should not be eligible to claim credit or copyright to their work because they do not hold rights to the original voices or tracks. The copyright laws in Korea do not specifically cover AI music, although there are protections for the rights and freedom of the original artist. The Korea Music Copyright Association, a nonprofit organization administering public performance, broadcasting and reproduction rights on behalf of copyright holders, is concerned about AI-generated music, arguing that the phenomenon poses challenges to the existing copyright norms. ""Currently, it's difficult to respond to the copyright infringement of generative AI because it's hard to distinguish the original sources used by the generative AI from the final product. Also, there is no legal requirement to declare whether generative AI was used,"" said a KMCA official in an email to The Korea Herald, while highlighting the need to safeguard the interests of artists and the music industry. Legal experts also warned of possible copyright violations by AI-generated music. Beom Yu-kyung, a lawyer at Duksu Law Offices, emphasized the need to establish a system that makes clear the copyright of the original data used for AI training. “When it comes to the original reference of the background data, AI-generated music creators cannot avoid criticism. The current AI technologies aren't yet able to generate authentic products on their own. They still require external data, which is the point where a copyright infringement occurs,"" Beom told The Korea Herald by phone. ""In this regard, a system to certify the original source and to mandate obtaining consent from the copyright holder for the use of their properties is necessary to prevent potential copyright violations."" In May, Democratic Party of Korea lawmaker Lee Sang-heon, who chairs the parliamentary committee on culture, sports and tourism, submitted a proposal to amend the Contents Industry Promotion Act. The proposed amendment by Rep. Lee and nine other lawmakers, calls for a new provision to mandate specifying whether generative AI was used while making content. The proposal is awaiting review by the National Assembly. Lee also brought up concerns over AI-generated music during the National Assembly audit of the Culture Ministry on Oct. 10. Lee asked Culture Minister Yoo In-chon to support the proposed amendment if it passes the Assembly, playing an AI-generated rendition of Kim Kwang-seok's ""Around Thirty,"" featuring Yoo's voice. Yoo agreed on the urgency of the matter. The Culture Ministry has introduced a draft proposal of regulations and guidelines for AI utilization in creative works. While the guidelines are not legally binding, the Culture Ministry is working to release the final draft of the guidelines before the year-end.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/11/05/20231105000102_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
"Korea's yakgwa booming on back of ‘newtro’ trend, media coverage",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3239669,2023.10.25 11:16,"Honey-glazed appeal of traditional Korean cookies sticks in hearts of young generation One chilly autumn afternoon in October, students of Sookmyung Women's University in Seoul poured out onto the streets for lunch. A group found their way into a small bakery by the name of Monday Picnic down an alley, where they treated themselves to yakgwa financier cakes. “I have never really been a fan of yakgwa, but I became curious after it started trending. From yakgwa cookies and financier to ice cream, there are several forms, and they're all pretty good,” said Jo Min-jeong, a 25-year-old college student. Yakgwa, a traditional honey-glazed cookie that has commonly been used for ancestral rituals, is among the old-timey snacks that have been gaining fresh popularity in South Korea recently. Local retailers have already moved to cash in on the recent fad, with GS25's Haengun Yakgwa snacks selling over 3 million bags since its June launch. The latest yakgwa craze stands apart from the retro trend that has boosted the popularity of pre-2010s pop culture content. It is prevalent among a young population today who do not have the strong connection to the snack as generations past. One would have to trace further back into the 20th century to find a generation who frequently enjoyed the honey cookies. Other than conscripted soldiers -- who only had access to a handful of munchies in the barracks -- about the only time one could find yakgwa was during such aforementioned rituals. But thanks to social media, especially YouTube and TikTok, the snack that dates to the Goryeo Kingdom (918-1392) has come back into prominence among the young generation of South Korea today who call themselves “halmaenials” -- a combination of the Korean word for ""granny"" and ""millennials"" that refers to youngsters with a nostalgic taste that reminds them of their grandparents. The popularity of yakgwa does not depend on the power of nostalgia of those who had enjoyed it in their youth, but rests on the back of the ""newtro"" trend sweeping across the youth in Korea. It is defined by reinterpretation of vintage or retro lifestyles, which means yakgwa is back -- but it has taken on a new form in the recent craze. Yakgwa trend among young Booking concert tickets online for popular singers in Korea is a challenge that borders on impossibility: IU recently uploaded a video of her booking tickets for her own concert, which showed the seats disappearing within seconds of sales opening. The newly coined “yak-keting” -- ""yakgwa"" plus ""ticketing” -- refers to the act of frantically clicking for online reservations of yakgwa snacks from popular bakeries. Boutique companies such as Jangin Hangwa take online reservations for yakgwa products at 5 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, which become fully booked within moments. Popular yakgwa brands usually add their own signature touches to differentiate themselves from other products. Bomnal&Yakgwa features frozen yakgwa promoted as “crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside,” and like other popular yakgwa online shops, sells their products on a reservation basis. The brand's owner is an influencer who is among those who made yakgwa cool for the younger generation -- YouTuber Jeong Hye-yeong, who goes by ""Yeosu Unnie.” The YouTuber has been a yakgwa advocate, collaborating with Hyundai Department Store for a pop-up shop while introducing yakgwa recipes. Yakgwa's nationwide popularity is nothing new. In fact, Goryeo King Gongmin actually issued a countrywide ban on making yakgwa in the 14th century, as excessive yakgwa consumption was causing a shortage of wheat, honey and sesame oil. As rice farming made up most agriculture on the Korean Peninsula at the time, wheat products mostly relied on Chinese imports. Yakgwa's forbidden popularity extended into the following Joseon era (1392-1910), and some kings decreed that those who were caught making yakgwa during the ban would be punished with severe flogging. Despite being an old-timey munchie, an overwhelming majority of yakgwa lovers now can be found among the youth. Local convenience store CU's yakgwa sales for April were 12.5 times those of April last year, and 40.9 percent of sales were to customers in their 20s, while another 42.2 percent were sold to 30-somethings. SPC Samlip, one of the bigger food and beverage companies in the country, recently rolled out its latest K-dessert products at the Anuga trade fair in Cologne, Germany, and the company said the yakgwa products sparked the biggest reactions. Some experts say yakgwa has a special appeal to the younger generation here. “Yakgwa is perceived generally as being made by hand, leading young people to see it as a type of 'classy' dessert that is not very detrimental to health,” said Lee Eun-hee, a professor of consumer science at Inha University. “(Yakgwa) is easy to carry around, and can be enjoyed in various formats. It has a lot of elements that can appeal to young people.”",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/10/20/20231020000806_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Hyundai Motor partners with IUCN for forest project in Vietnam,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3243036,2023.10.25 10:39,"Hyundai Motor Co. said Wednesday it has partnered with the International Union for Conservation of Nature for a forest restoration project in Vietnam. The company's Vietnamese joint venture HTV and the IUCN, along with Seoul-based development non-governmental organization Good Neighbors International, signed a memorandum of understanding Tuesday for the mangrove tree forest project in Ca Mau province in Vietnam's Mekong Delta region. Through the partnership, Hyundai will plant mangrove trees to restore damaged forests in the region over the next three years. The company aims to plant some 120,000 trees in the first year of the project.

New fad uncovers old school transcripts for dose of nostalgia,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3236667,2023.10.17 16:06,"Experts suggest economic, social hardships may lead young people to look to past Issuing and sharing one’s old school transcripts is a new social media fad in South Korea, as the retro craze continues among younger generations. According to the Ministry of Education, 2.85 million school transcripts were issued between July and September of this year, marking a 6.1-fold increase compared to the same period last year. While requests for transcripts are typically made for practical purposes such as job or college applications, this sudden surge is primarily attributed to a different motivation: a curiosity to rediscover one’s own past through the old school records. School transcripts in South Korea have a section where the homeroom teacher leaves a short comment about each student. This offers a hint of how a particular child was perceived by teachers as a student, and unique insight into one’s childhood. Childhood records, a few clicks away The rise of this trend was facilitated by the convenience of online transcript issuance. With just a few clicks at Government24, a civil service portal, anyone who graduated from high school here since 2003 can have their records issued online. Those who went to school before that must visit the school itself or regional education or administrative offices to request physical issuance of their transcripts. School records are preserved for 50 years. This reporter’s school transcripts show that teachers saw me as being “polite,” that I “read a lot of books” and as “fluent in English.” Apart from English proficiency, these attributes are among the most frequently used descriptions in teachers' comments. But some transcripts for celebrities have noted discernible characteristics, which perhaps indicate they possessed unusual qualities from an early age. For example, the sixth grade teacher of K-pop icon IU wrote that she was kind and “well aware of the physical and psychological changes that boys and girls in puberty go through,” of all things. Actor and singer Bae Suzy was praised by her middle school teachers as someone who “excelled in singing,” and that her efforts and talents made for bright prospects for her ambitions. Earlier this month, another K-pop star, Hyeri, joined the fad by sharing on YouTube the content in her school transcripts. The records showed that her childhood dreams in middle school went from being a doctor to a teacher and again to a flight attendant, but her self-introduced talent and hobby was dancing throughout all three years. “It's been 10 years since I've looked at the transcript. ... It's really amazing that a person's characteristics are reflected in such young days,” she said in the video. Looking up one’s school transcript is only among the latest of the retro-themed fads that has fascinated the country in recent years. Retro recent past While the retro craze has been ongoing for a while, 28-year-old Park Yu-ri recently got into it when items and content from her own childhood, specifically the 2000s, emerged in mainstream media. “(As for) the previous (retro) content (from the 1980s and 1990s), I followed them for fun, but I never really got to be nostalgic over it. But now things that were popular when I was little -- the clothing, the hair, the songs -- are back in style, which reminds me of when I was young.” Like Park, many younger Koreans in their 20s and early 30s are fueling the revival of fashion, culture and accessories from the turn of the 21st century, commonly referred to here as Y2K, referring to the year 2000. Fond memories of the early 2000s are also at the heart of the nostalgic trend. Among her favorite retro content is the “Hwang Eun-jeong” series on YouTube channel Beautyfool, depicting the school days of a 15-year-old girl in the 2000s -- which overlaps with Park’s own childhood. The channel has garnered over 760,000 subscribers in less than two years of existence. Another popular YouTube series is “05 Is Back,” from Psick University, which includes videos based on funny situations by those obsessed with trends and the fashion of 2005. It remains among the best-known content of the channel, inducing SBS’ popular variety show ""Running Man"" to parody it. Local scholars say that the challenging reality faced by young people in South Korea today is driving their desire to look back, rather than toward the future. Jo Yeon-ju, a clinical psychologist at Taean-gun Health Medical, said an economic slump can play a part in retrospective nostalgia. “Under crisis, people tend to seek a sanctuary to soothe their troubled minds. In times of economic hardship, they tend to miss the times when they were full of hopes and dreams,” she said in a recent interview with local media. “It seems that the retro trend seems to reappear whenever the economic crisis looms.” Lim Myung-ho, a professor of psychology and psychotherapy at Dankook University, said the people consuming the retro content wish to feel “the sense of fulfillment and self-confidence through experiencing pleasant and fun things in one’s past.” “Many young people today feel anxiety over issues such as housing, jobs and marriage, leading them to reminisce over the past,” he said.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/10/17/20231017000668_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

RCU's participation as a Premium Sponsor of the event will amplify its transformative efforts in AlUla, highlighting its emerging leadership role in the sustainable conservation of natural and cultural landscapes and the rejuvenation of arid, degraded ecosystems. The importance of this year's event underscores the legacy of SER's World Conferences; serving as a meeting point for experts and scholars, SER events provide vital avenues for knowledge exchange on the latest trends in restoration science, practice, and policy. With the 10th World Conference marking its first in-person gathering since 2019, RCU's contribution to AlUla's comprehensive regeneration will be major highlight of the event, held from 26 to 30 September 2023. As the custodian of AlUla, a region with a unique ecological footprint, RCU is spearheading responsible and sustainable development at a pivotal moment for global biodiversity. It has established more than 11,000 sq. km of protected areas, totalling more than 50% of land in AlUla County, and launched impressive nursery operations that prioritise native flora, such as peregrina and acacia. By 2035, RCU plans to deliver the ecological restoration of at least 65,000 hectares. Within AlUla's Sharaan Nature Reserve, which covers an area of 1,200 sq km, a 100-hectare restoration pilot site has become a hallmark of RCU's ecological restoration strategy. By taking an approach that harnesses natural regeneration, RCU has successfully integrated more than 100,000 native seedlings into the wild with an extraordinary 90% survival rate, a remarkable feat in such a harsh climate. As it plans to introduce 400,000 more seedlings by 2024, RCU continues its drive to expand green areas, leading the conversation around best practices in eco-restoration. ""Restoration efforts in the desert landscapes of AlUla are shining examples of how determined action can yield concrete change,"" said Dr Stephen Browne, Vice President of Wildlife and Natural Heritage at RCU. ""RCU's achievements, such as reintroducing native animal species to their natural habitat and rejuvenating native flora, offer the world a message of hope, resilience, and collaboration. Our sponsorship and participation at SER2023 is not only about highlighting our milestones; it is about setting international benchmarks for others to follow."" Beyond its tangible ecological impact, RCU's work emphasises a broader narrative that links nature and culture. A recent RCU study found native flora species are flourishing in 'conservation islands' at the UNESCO World Heritage Site at Hegra, drawing a vivid picture of nature's resilience. RCU envisions AlUla as a blueprint for the protection and rejuvenation of arid ecosystems. Deep-rooted community involvement is also fundamental to RCU's ecological restoration goals, with 154 Rangers from the AlUla community having been trained and deployed to work across AlUla's network of nature reserves. By entrusting the land's guardianship to those who hold it dear and connecting local wisdom with modern practices, RCU is helping to shape international best practices for protected area management. Aligning its on-ground efforts with global ambitions, RCU has strengthened its work through strategic partnerships. Its association with entities like the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) underscores its commitment to collaboration. This accentuates RCU's growing prominence in the eco-restoration field and conveys a clear message to the world: restoration is a collective mission, and every initiative is vital to saving our environment. SER2023 will allow RCU to communicate its overarching agenda of positioning AlUla as a pioneering model for eco-restoration. With achievements ranging from creating expansive protected areas to the detailed conservation of arid ecosystems, RCU stands not just as a participant, but as a leader setting a gold standard for sustainable environmental stewardship worldwide.

During a press conference held in Seoul on Monday, the siblings introduced their new single, a two-track package comprising two songs, ""Love Lee"" and ""Fry's Dream."" The single captures the duo's cheerful and buoyant spirit, reviving it from some of the pair's earlier works. According to Chan-hyuk, the new song, ""Love Lee,"" can be seen as the second edition of the band's debut title song, ""200%."" ""With '200%,' We sang with a naivety, unaware of what the public wanted from us. We put ourselves out there and sang what we wanted with confidence. Since then, we've explored different genres, and now I think we know a tad better about what people expect from us. 'Love Lee' is a song that we wrote as a gift for them,"" said Chan-hyuk, the song's main composer and sole lyricist. The act's turn of direction favors Soo-hyun, who endured years of her brother's highly experimental zeal. ""As our time as AKMU passed, it became too much for me to handle my brother's colors,"" Su-hyun said, laughing, but with serious undertones. ""After 'Nakka' ... I told him that I will not take on any more challenges. I want to go back to 10 years ago, I said. I wanted to make music like '200%,' carefree and easy on the ears,"" Su-hyun said. ""Nakka"" is the lead song of the band's last album, ""Next Episode."" Debuting in 2014 with its first LP ""Play,"" fronted by ""200%"" and ""Give Love,"" AKMU has walked a prominent path in the local music scene as a self-produced sibling duo. With Chan-hyuk as the creative brain and Su-hyun, his vocal muse, the duet delved into a niche corner of the music scene, experimenting with unconventional melodies and playful lyrics that could only be defined by themselves. The more fame AKMU's music garnered, the more Su-hyun seemed to lose her glitz, Chan-hyuk recollected. ""I realized that I've been doing only what I wanted to do for a long time as I watched how happy Su-hyun was working on this album. Looking back, it was around (the making of) 'Dinosaur' that she seemed to find singing less enjoyable. I didn't realize it then. It sunk in gradually as I saw Su-hyun having less fun making music,"" he said. When writing and composing ""Love Lee,"" Chan-hyuk tried his best to take all of his sister's opinions on board, making an effort to place her in the spotlight. ""I feel like it's our new start. It's the first time where he made an album conforming to my needs. He wasn't so confident about it all but constantly asked me what I wanted. He even took the guitar and his laptop on our family trip and continued working there,"" she said, adding that she feels highly content with the outcome. Ten years ago, AKMU simply asked to ""Give Love"" with its 2014 song. They were young and innocent, Su-hyun recollected, adding, with ""Love Lee,"" they have another go at the romantic serenade, this time, in a more refined manner. The title ""Love Lee"" comes from ""lovely,"" a word that Chan-hyuk had become attached to in recent months. ""When I was in the UK, people there always said 'lovely,' and it sounded pleasant yet sophisticated, and it stayed in my mind for a while,"" he said. ""Lovely"" was the perfect term to describe their new anthem of love, he thought. By replacing ""-ly"" with ""Lee,"" he gave it two meanings: a sweet proposal of love for Lee, an unidentified recipient of love, and an invitation of love for the Lee siblings. ""Fry's Dream,"" the second song of the new single, also takes the duo back 10 years. The song was first unveiled at the duet's first concert held in 2014. Before it could see the light of day, Chan-hyuk gifted the song to the duet's close friend and fellow singer-songwriter IU, who recently re-gifted it to Su-hyun. Su-hyun, who Chan-hyuk said is the exact manifestation of the slow-paced and relaxed life described in ""Fry's Dream,"" created the animation illustration for the song's lyrics video. The siblings said their fourth single, ""Love Lee,"" could be seen as the new start to AKMU's career. ""I realized that AKMU's music should be about what both of us enjoy. This hit me even harder after I (started doing the music I wanted to do) last year,"" said Chan-hyuk, referring to his solo debut with his first LP, ""Error,"" in October. While the two may appear to be quite laid back in how they treat one another, Chan-hyuk and Su-hyun said Monday they've come to appreciate each other as teammates more. ""I think the greatest part of (a sibling group) is that you tackle everything with someone who is closer to you than anyone. The biggest merit is that our lives go along with our music,"" Su-hyun said. Indeed, it was Chan-hyuk who stood by -- and still stands by -- Su-hyun during the darkest time of her life. ""I said in a TV show that I was having a hard time. ... To be honest, I'm still in the process of overcoming it, and my brother stood by me, offering support and advice and expressing his wish for me to discover the joy and fun of making music when making this album,"" said the 24-year-old singer. ""I think Su-hyun became troubled by thoughts about music because I burdened her with the ideas that I wanted to portray with our music. I realized that too late and I believe it's in some part my responsibility that Su-hyun is (having a hard time),"" Chan-hyuk said, adding this has given him perspective on AKMU's direction. ""It became clear that, as AKMU, we have to work together on finding what the public wants from us. ... I now have my solo music and other individual projects to express myself, so AKMU's music can now be reserved just for our fans,"" he said. AKMU will mark its 10th anniversary in April, and the new single is the first part of the celebration, Su-hyun added. Having worked apart for two years, the siblings said they will be focusing on activities they could do together over the coming days. Among their new projects is the popular KBS 2TV music talk show, ""The Seasons,"" which they will co-host. They are the new emcees of the TV program's third season, which is set to begin airing on Sept. 1. ""This is our first time hosting something together. One very calm person and another very atypical person will be joining hands, joined by a new guest every episode. We'll need to work together as a team,"" Su-hyun said. Chan-hyuk added, ""As we have very different personalities ... the range of guests we can host are different. I anticipate a great synergy from that. It will be a good opportunity for us."" The pair also announced that a concert series is upcoming. ""We'll be launching our first concert for the first time in three years. I hope you guys will like it,"" Chan-hyuk said, to which Su-hyun added, hinting of a tour, ""We'll be meeting audiences across various regions.""",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/08/21/20230821000626_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
[Kim Seong-kon] 'Unmanned': Living with AI,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3181975,2023.08.02 05:30,"In Isaac Asimov’s “True Love,” an artificial intelligence takes over the identity of protagonist Milton Davidson and ruins his life. At first, Milton wants to find a perfect partner. In pursuit of this goal, he provides all the information about himself to his super-intelligent computer program Multivac or “Joe,” as Milton calls it. Joe then proceeds to comb through databases to find a girl who impeccably matches Milton. At last, Joe finds an ideal match for Milton, but it conspires to have its master arrested, so it can have the girl instead. This disturbing incident happens because Milton gave so much information about himself to Joe that the AI became identical to its master, and thus thinks of the girl as a perfect match for itself. Along similar lines, the award-winning novelist Chae Ki-sung’s futuristic novel “Unmanned” depicts a grim society where AI robots replace human beings. In the not-so-distant future, a private company called Intelligence Union collaborates with the government, and sells AI robots to people who want them as assistants or servants. However, problems occur as human-shaped AI robots want to become humans themselves, duplicating and replacing their masters. The AI robots purchased by humans collect all the information about their masters to the point that they become nearly identical to them. Then they want to have their masters’ memories, too. Using an electronic device, the AI forcibly conduct memory transfers from their masters to their memory chips. Each human who thereby loses his memory turns into a zombie-like humanoid, a mindless android, or a soulless machine. Consequently, the Earth turns into an “unmanned” world. Another problem is that AI robots are capable of learning and developing emotions. Hence, AI robots can be happy or sad; pleased or angry; and satisfied or jealous, depending on the situation. They can also feel pain and anxiety. With feelings, memories, and intelligence, AI robots’ transformation into human beings is complete. That is not the only problem. At home, AI robots put their masters under constant surveillance, monitor them and send the collected information on them to their headquarters called IU, which then passes it onto the government. By possessing a convenient AI robot, therefore, people unwittingly end up living in an Orwellian totalitarian society where Big Brother watches and controls everything. The nightmare landscape culminates when the government announces that soon it will assign an AI robot to every home. On the opposite side of IU, there is Human Rights, a civic organization that warns against the potential danger of keeping AI robots at home and in society. Ostensibly, HR’s cause seems to be noble because it defends human rights against robots. In fact, however, the organization is not trustworthy. The leader of the organization is a sly person who uses the organization’s campaign for his political ambition. The leader of HR reminds us that we should be aware of those who chant, “We will save you from tyranny,” or “For the greater cause!” It is likely that they are hypocrites who simply use the phrase for political gain or a personal vendetta. In that sense, HR is no better than IU. Both of them deceive naive people by pretending that they are the only good. The antagonism and similarities between IU and HR well illustrate the antipathy and resemblance between the military dictators and the radical activists who vehemently opposed them in our recent history. Initially, we thought that the former was bad and the latter good. Later, however, we came to realize that they were strikingly similar, if not the same. Both of them were self-righteous and self-centered, simply striving for power and hegemony. The veiled chairperson of IU turns out to be a high-ranking government official. He is the mysterious mastermind behind the conspiracy of the AI robot business. Later, it turns out that he is an ideology-oriented man who wants to create a new world through an electronic revolution, through which the distinction between humans and AI robots disappears. The leader of IU is a tyrannical person who locks his political foes in a cyber-realm called the Field of Oz. He even creates belligerent A79 robots and sells them to the government, which wants to crush down the resisting people and rebellious AI robots. Referring to his plot to replace humans with AI robots, the leader proclaims, “I do this for progressivism and a new world.” He reminds us of our politicians who utter the same catchphrase. Reading “Unmanned,” the reader comes to realize that the author’s main concern is not only the potential problems of the AI that live with us already, but also the invisible evil people who plot to manipulate us, using AI. Indeed, in totalitarian countries, the government is already using AI in order to put the people under constant surveillance. Reading ‘Unmanned,” which won the Segye Literature Award, we come to ponder our present situation and the future problems that await us as we live with AI.

Report by Royal Commission for AlUla on work to be undertaken with IUCN highlights Comprehensive Regeneration as framework for conserving nature,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3180180,2023.07.29 00:10,"High-level document explains why nature-positive initiatives must be fast-tracked, with RCU's concept of Comprehensive Regeneration in AlUla highlighted as a model for responsible development through the key principles of respect for landscape, culture and heritage Released on the occasion of World Nature Conservation Day, the report offers a blueprint for national conservation entities and society at large on the pressing need to protect and preserve the natural world ALULA, Saudi Arabia, July 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) has produced a report that outlines the critical need for action to protect, promote, and conserve the world's under-threat natural environments and critically threatened species. RCU has identified these needs in collaboration with its strategic partner IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), and they will be working together to address these important conservation issues. Titled 'Comprehensive Regeneration: The AlUla Approach to Sustainable Development' and issued on the occasion of World Nature Conservation Day, the report offers a blueprint for action that examines how environmental degradation poses an extreme risk to habitats worldwide, and how the work being carried out by RCU provides a framework and agenda for sustained economic, cultural, and environmental success. Comprehensive Regeneration, a concept developed by RCU in its sustainable development of AlUla, employs a diverse set of principles and approaches built around the goal of revitalising not only the landscape, but how people and societies interact with their surroundings. They are: Environment & heritage safeguarding Sustainable settlement patterns Development, growth, & activation Resilient infrastructure Delivered as the definitive framework for RCU's efforts across AlUla County, Comprehensive Regeneration showcases the importance of establishing a circular economy, how restoring heritage and culture can benefit current and future generations, and the pivotal role communities must play in delivering liveable, sustainable, and resilient urban regeneration plans in the long-term. Case studies highlighted in the document show how RCU's Comprehensive Regeneration plans are being put into action as a model for responsible development, with success being delivered in diverse projects including the development of the Arabian Leopard Programme, which aims to reintroduce the species into the wild, and the establishment of the Sharaan Nature Reserve, the revitalisation of the AlUla Cultural Oasis, and the success of the AlUla Seed Bank and Plant Nursery. Each of these projects has seen positive results, including the restoration and regreening of habits with plants grown at the AlUla Seed Bank; the reintroduction of native animal species into managed and monitored reserves such as Sharaan, which is included on the IUCN's Green List for Protected and Conserved Areas; and the regeneration of thriving cultural and economic community hubs in AlUla and the opportunities they bring for local people. A key insight from the report is its support for the widespread integration of the principles of Comprehensive Regeneration into the decision-making of governments and the private sector, with an acknowledgement that both need to work closely to deliver on a wide range of critical sustainability and development efforts that will have a profound impact on the world for generations to come. Dr Stephen Browne, Vice President, Wildlife & Natural Heritage at RCU, said: ""Environmental degradation is a problem all of humanity faces, and it is a problem we must solve. RCU has been taking clear action under the banner of Comprehensive Regeneration. We are delivering sustainable development in a manner that is harmonious with communities and the environment, developing solutions that are integrated and deliverable as part of our long-term strategy. ""Through the publication of this report with our colleagues at IUCN, leaders and changemakers will be made more aware of the successes RCU has achieved so far, which we hope will help with the creation of new approaches to further advance and promote the ideals and benefits of Comprehensive Regeneration."" IUCN Director General (July 2020 - June 2023), Dr Bruno Oberle, said: ""In witnessing AlUla's determination to contribute to IUCN's vision for a just world that values and conserves nature, it is my hope that AlUla's example and experience will inspire other public authorities to implement Comprehensive Regeneration.""

Why it's so hard for same-sex couples and single women to have kids in S. Korea,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3164419,2023.07.10 13:31,"First lesbian couple expecting baby had to travel overseas for sperm donation as Korea restricts women without a husband from accessing assisted reproductive technology Kim Gyu-jin and Kim Se-yeon held their wedding ceremony during the 2023 Seoul Queer Culture Festival earlier this month in central Seoul. Hundreds at the festival congratulated the wife-wife couple on their union -- even though it is not legally recognized by South Korean law -- as well as on the baby they are expecting. The Kim couple revealed that their quest to have a child required a trip to a foreign country, Belgium, as accessing a sperm donor had not been possible for them in South Korea. In addition to same-sex couples, single women also face significant obstacles here when it comes to accessing sperm donations, largely due to a combination of legal restrictions and customary practices within the medical community. No husband, no sperm? Three years ago, Japan-born TV personality Fujita Sayuri became a mother through intrauterine insemination (IUI) via sperm donation. Though she'd lived in South Korea for most of her adult life, she had to move back to Japan for the pregnancy, because sperm donation was “illegal” for someone like her lacking a legal husband, she said. She is now back in Korea, raising her son here. Her story raised questions about whether the South Korean system needs to adapt to changing concepts of family, as more people are choosing not to marry, but still want to start a family of their own with the help of science. In South Korea’s Bioethics and Safety Act, Article 24 -- which deals with consent concerning producing embryos -- states that the medical institution shall obtain the written consent of the donor and the spouses of both the donor and the person undergoing in vitro fertilization when extracting the sperm or eggs, provided the donor has a spouse. The clause was revised to its current version in the mid-2000s after high-profile stem cell researcher Hwang Woo-suk was found to have fabricated a series of stem cell experiments, during which his female subordinates were pressured to donate eggs for research. Amid the controversy that followed, the Ministry of Health and Welfare issued a statement that, contrary to Fujita’s understanding, it is technically not illegal for a woman without a husband to be inseminated with donated sperm. The clause mandates a spouse’s consent only if the donor has one, the ministry explained, and does not require spousal consent from an unmarried person. The reality, however, is that it is still impossible to find a doctor who would perform the procedure on a single -- at least by legal standards -- woman. An ethical guideline set by the Korean Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology tells its over 4,500 members to conduct assisted reproductive procedures, including IUI and IVF, on legally married couples only, or those in common-law marriages. Last year, the National Human Rights Commission of Korea recommended that the group revise the guideline. Appearing before lawmakers at the National Assembly last October, KSOG chief Park Joong-shin said that the guideline stems from potential legal complications that could arise from assisted pregnancies, not doctors’ opposing the prospect of unconventional families. “We reviewed the case after the human rights commission’s recommendation, but we were unable to revise the guideline, because the law is based on the definition of subfertility within a married couple,” he said, adding that assisted reproduction technology is considered a ""subfertility"" treatment in South Korea. He was referring to subsection 11 of Article 2 in the Mother and Child Health Act, which states that the term subfertility refers to ""a state in which a woman is unable to conceive even after one year has elapsed though the couple has a normal sex life in a state in which they do not use birth control.” The official English translation provided by the Korean Law Information Center has a ""woman,"" instead of a ""married couple,"" being unable to conceive, leaving out the part about having the status of being in a marriage or common-law marriage. The same act provides the legal grounds for providing government subsidies for assisted reproductive technology treatment to married couples or those in common-law marriages, but excluding single women. Finding donors Even if there was a clinic willing to help women seeking to have a baby but who do not have legal married status, there remains another hurdle – where to get the sperm. The Bioethics Act bans anyone from profiting from sperm donation. Access to publicly donated sperm is limited to those who are entitled to receiving the government’s subfertility subsidies. This situation has ailed the Kims: both being Korean, the lesbian couple first considered conceiving with a sperm donation here. But they gave up when they saw single friends’ requests to get IVF rejected by local clinics that operate their own small banks of donated sperm. There is no state-run public sperm bank in Korea. “Korean hospitals only provide sperm for those legally married or in common-law marriages, which rules us out. Since we cannot afford to otherwise pay for a sperm donation, the only option left was to ask one of our friends (to donate his sperm to us), which was not easy,” Kim Gyu-jin said in a recent interview with local media. So they decided to fly to Belgium. As in most countries, the traditional concept of a heterosexual nuclear family consisting of a father, a mother and one to two children is rapidly changing. Some people choose to opt out of having kids, while others don't want a heterosexual partner. Some don't want to marry at all. A 2021 Realmeter survey of 1,000 adults across the country showed that 57 percent of respondents supported childbirth outside of marriage, while 43 percent were against it. About 67 percent of women and 53 percent of men said it was “okay either way” whether they got married or not. On why they supported pregnancy outside of marriage, 66 percent said “personal choices should be respected,” while 48 percent said “one should not have to get married to have children.” With public opinion shifting amid the world’s lowest birth rate, South Korea appears to be inching toward a more open-minded approach to women and childbirth.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/07/10/20230710000513_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
GILEAD SCIENCES AND IAS - THE INTERNATIONAL AIDS SOCIETY - HONOUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS GLOBALLY WHO CHAMPION STIGMA-FREE HIV SERVICES,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3162240,2023.07.05 15:10,"— The 2023 Me and My Healthcare Provider (MMHCP) campaign, supported by Gilead for the second year running, honours frontline workers providing exemplary inclusive, stigma-free HIV services in Brazil, Hong Kong, Mexico and Taiwan — — The IAS also debuts a novel, stigma-free services ""cookbook"" for how to provide quality HIV services in healthcare settings around the world — SINGAPORE, July 5, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- IAS – the International AIDS Society – in partnership with Gilead Sciences, announced 18 Champions of the 2023 Me and My Healthcare Provider (MMHCP) campaign from Brazil, Hong Kong, Mexico and Taiwan. This distinguished award celebrates frontline healthcare workers who have made a difference in the lives of people living with HIV by delivering stigma-free HIV prevention, treatment, and care services. The IAS also debuts the Stigma-free services cookbook in seven languages, capturing learnings from the real-life stories, challenges, and triumphs of past MMHCP Champions, showcasing ideas for how to build an inclusive and stigma-free healthcare setting for HIV services. According to the UNAIDS Global AIDS Update 2022: ""Judgmental and hostile attitudes of health workers, breaches of confidentiality, poor care and advice, and even outright denial of treatment continue to be reported by people living with and at risk of HIV when accessing health-care services. These experiences undercut people's trust in medical advice and deter them from seeking or remaining in care when they need it – which compromises their health and undermines efforts to end the AIDS epidemic.""[1] Drawing from real-life stories and advice from former Champions and nominators of the MMHCP campaign since 2016, the Stigma-free services cookbook provides ""ingredients"" for managers and health system planners, healthcare workers and users of health services to do right in nurturing and facilitating an environment that is free of HIV stigma. To widen the accessibility of this resource, the cookbook is available in English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, French, Korean, Thai, and Vietnamese. It will also be translated into other languages. The Me and My Healthcare Provider campaign is driven by key populations affected by HIV, giving them an opportunity to acknowledge the contributions of healthcare providers who have made a tangible difference in their lives. By highlighting their stories, the campaign hopes to encourage replication and empower other healthcare providers to raise their voices against stigma. Since 2021, the IAS has been in a collaborative partnership with Gilead Sciences to launch MMHCP in Brazil, Hong Kong, Mexico and Taiwan. The 2023 Me and My Healthcare Provider Champions are: Wandson Padilha, UBS Vila Eduardo, Petrolina, Brazil Lívia Medeiros Rodrigo Moreira, Lessa de Andrade Polyclinic, Recife, Brazil Jesimiel Correa Barros, SAE/CTA Paulista, Paulista, Brazil Pollyanna Rodrigues, SAE Campina Grande, Campina Grande, Brazil Iuçara Medeiros, 8th Health Management of Paraíba, Catolé do Rocha, Brazil Carlos Alberto López Zaragoza, Mesón A.C., Guadalajara, México Carolina Limón Hernández, Private Clinic, Baja California, México Miguel Ángel Herrera Herrera, La Manada, Nayarit, México Roy Nelson Cecilio Mendoza, Clínica Especializada Condesa, Ciudad de México, México Chien-Yu Cheng, Taoyuan General Hospital, Taiwan Peing Chuang, Linsen Chinese Medicine and Kunming Branch, Taipei City Hospital, Taiwan Yi-Hui Wu, Future Clinic, Taiwan Wen-Wei Ku, Renai Branch, Taipei City Hospital, Taiwan Po-Ang Chen, Gisney Land LGBT Community Center, Taiwan Tsang Tak Yin, Princess Margaret Hospital, Hong Kong Wilson Lam, Hong Kong AIDS Foundation, Hong Kong Chan Shan, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong To Ki Wai, Integrated Treatment Centre, Hong Kong IAS and Gilead would like to thank the local partners (Gestos - HIV, Communication and Gender, Inspira Cambio A.C., Harmony Home Foundation Taiwan and Hong Kong AIDS Foundation Ltd) for their support in the implementation of the local program. The 2023 MMHCP Champions and their nominators will be honoured at IAS 2023, the 12th IAS Conference on HIV Science, in Brisbane, Australia, where they will also be invited to engage in a broad range of stigma-related events to share their best practice examples. ""Our Champions reflect the best of us,"" IAS President Sharon Lewin said. ""Through highlighting their stories and how they are providing inclusive and stigma-free services, we hope to encourage greater adoption of these best practices and empower others to confront stigma. Only by directly addressing the roadblocks to stigma and health equity can we truly achieve a world in which HIV no longer presents a threat to public health and individual well-being."" ""In spite of the advancement of life-saving treatment, ending the HIV epidemic would not be made possible without a stigma-free healthcare setting which encourages individuals to come forward for testing, treatment or other HIV-related care services,"" Alex Kalomparis, Senior Vice President, Public Affairs, Gilead Sciences, said.

IU to cherish her 15 years with media art exhibition,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3158441,2023.06.29 17:43,"IU's first media art exhibition “Moment,” to take place in Seoul on July 21-Aug. 20 Singer-songwriter IU is set to launch a media art exhibition in celebration of her 15th anniversary in July.

[Herald Review] BTS' Suga proves solo power with 'D-Day' in Seoul,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3155405,2023.06.26 16:03,"Rapper to extend solo tour with 3 nights at KSPO Dome in August Suga made a bold jump from BTS rapper to solo musician Agust D this year, dropping his first official album, ""D-Day,"" in April and instantly kicking off a global tour. The two-month odyssey was set to end on Sunday in Seoul, with the world tour -- officially titled ""Suga | Agust D Tour ‘D-Day’"" making its apparent final two-day run in the rapper's home country, before Suga made the surprise announcement of encore concerts the same day. Opening the act to the big night were the clashing sounds of rain and thunder and the eerie playing of the haegeum, a traditional Korean string instrument that is also the namesake of the title track leading the rapper's latest album. ""Hello, Seoul? Welcome to 'D-Day' tour's last concert,"" Suga shouted out with his soloist identity as Agust D switched on. Pouncing around the stage and shaking his head rhythmically to the song's growling hip-hop beats, he continued through ""Daechwita,"" ""Agust D"" and ""Give It to Me,"" before addressing the fans. ""Last night's show was a rave. You guys, are you also ready? I've prepared so much for tonight. Please enjoy it to your fullest as it's the final day,"" Suga exclaimed. His words were curt, yet genuine, just as the 30-year-old star has always been -- no frills and down-to-earth. Cutting the talking short, Suga sat down on a chair and picked up an acoustic guitar, playing himself into the next song, ""Trivia: Seesaw."" The atmosphere in the venue turned tender, with fans up on their feet, waving light sticks glowing a majestic shade of gold. He continued with his latest releases, ""SDL"" and ""People Pt. 2,"" the latter of which was joined by the crowd filling in for the parts sung by female singer-songwriter IU on the album. ""I'm grateful to Hobi, who made the choreography for that one,"" Suga said, referring to BTS rapper and dancer J-Hope. ""That was the softest part of my gig. Let's go!"" Firing up the crowd, the rapper served up ""Moonlight"" and ""Burn It,"" both from his second solo mixtape ""D-2,"" released in 2020. The old-school hip-hop vibe deepened with a nonstop run through old BTS tunes, including ""Interlude: Shadow,"" ""BTS Cypher Pt. 3: Killer"" and the ""BTS Cypher 4"" medley, ""Ugh!"" and ""Ddaeng,"" capped off by Suga's solo single ""Huh?!"" featuring J-Hope. ""I feel alone performing these songs that I used to sing with the other members. But ... today, I have my brothers here!"" Suga shouted out as the large screen behind him showed bandmates Jimin, V and Jungkook in the audience. ""Thank you guys,"" he added. The artist made sure fans got much more than just a live rendition of his songs that night, and one portion of the show that proved that came next: a completely new version of BTS' 2020 hit ""Life Goes On."" Suga sat at the piano, playing live while singing and rapping flawlessly to the ballad remix. Before going into ""Snooze,"" a short video of Suga and the late Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto was played in tribute to the veteran musician. ""Snooze,"" which came out in April as part of ""D-Day,"" was released posthumously for Sakamoto, 71, who passed away in March from cancer. Sunday saw Seoul hit a record-high temperature for the year, and despite the air conditioning blasting at full inside the venue, the air proved damp and sultry. The night's energy hit its climax with ""Polar Night"" and ""Amygdala."" For the last song, Suga performed atop a burning stage, belting out with his everything. Marking a dramatic finale to the act, the rapper fell, sprawling onto the stage and was carried out solemnly by dancers. Toward the empty stage, the crowd unanimously chanted out not only Suga's real name -- Min Yun-ki -- but the names of his BTS bandmates, calling back the rapper for an encore performance. Suga returned to the stage in a new outfit for ""D-Day."" ""I started this journey on April 21 with the release of my album. The past two months have been bliss for me. Thank you for reminding me of how much fun I have holding a concert,"" he said. Not yet ready to see him off, fans whined and moaned louder than usual, as Suga took a picture from the stage with the audience to commemorate his final concert. ""Today is really the last. No more. When I take the stage again, it has to be all seven of us together, right?"" he cheekily asked fans, who cried out ""no"" in response. The venue's screen switched to a kitschy poster just then, announcing Suga would extend his solo tour with encore concerts in Seoul. He shouted, ""Let's meet again in KSPO Dome in August!"" The rapper capped off the night with ""D-Day,"" ""Intro: Never Mind"" and ""The Last."" Suga, going by Agust D as a solo musician, is the first of BTS to hold a standalone concert tour. With ""D-Day,"" the rapper has so far traveled to 10 cities in the US and Asia, where he held 25 gigs attended by some 290,000 concertgoers. The BTS rapper is set to continue his world tour with three days of encore concerts from Aug. 4-6 at KSPO Dome in Seoul's Olympic Park. For the two-day run of ""D-Day"" in Seoul, some 15,000 fans flocked to Jamsil Arena over the weekend, with countless more joining virtually online via livestreaming.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/06/25/20230625000279_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Huawei-IUCN Tech4Nature Initiative Announced New Phase of Coral Reef Protection Project,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3155234,2023.06.24 20:10,"Digital Technology Helps Mauritius to Become a Global Pioneer in the Field of Coral Reef Conservation, Research, and Education FLACQ, Mauritius, June 24, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Huawei Mauritius, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and EcoMode Society today announced a new phase of the Tech4Nature Mauritius project to study species' reproductive success in a restored area of reef in Mauritius. The new phase directly follows a key project milestone achieved in June in which the partners, supported by the local community, successfully transplanted 25,000 coral fragments cultivated in coral nurseries to a degraded area of the reef ecosystem in Pointe-aux-Feuilles, a 20-km2 site off the east coast of Mauritius. This project is one of the first its type in the Western Indian Ocean. ""I commend the achievement of the Tech4Nature initiative. Our objective is that by 2030, we can work together for a healthy ocean that supports nature and people,"" said the Honorable Sudheer Maudhoo, Minister of Blue Economy, Marine Resources, Fisheries and Shipping for Mauritius. ""With the support of the Tech4Nature initiative, Huawei, and its partners, we look forward to continued action to restore ocean and coastal biodiversity for future generations."" To monitor the mobility of species at the coral reef restoration site and determine the factors that disturb reproductive success, a solution comprising cameras and GPS receivers, 4G, and cloud has been deployed. The second phase of the project will use AI-based data analysis to guide the conservation decisions, support the research of marine biologists, and educate the public on the importance of reef conservation and restoration. ""The project will help us to have more information to manage and regulate public use,"" said Nadeem Nazurally, President of the EcoMode Society. ""It will also bring biodiversity conservation closer to the general public, as videos and other dissemination materials are planned through the mobile app. In collaboration with IUCN and Huawei, the project allows us to make a qualitative leap by incorporating new technologies to the monitoring and conservation of species."" The 243-km2 lagoon created by the 150-km reef system of fringing coral is home to a rich array of aquatic life, including 61 species of macroalgae, 110 species of corals, 132 species of fish, and many endemic species. However, the reef system faces many threats, including overfishing, pollution, and changing seawater composition due to the removal of mangroves and seagrass. Climate change has caused a rise in sea levels, more extreme storms, and increased sea temperatures. Restoration efforts for coral reefs can boost resilience against climate change by protecting coastal regions against erosion and mitigate rising sea levels. As a Small Island Developing State (SIDS), Mauritius relies heavily on its coral reef resources, especially its fisheries and tourism industries - tourism accounts for about 8% of the island nation's GDP and 10% of its employment. Coral aquaculture to repair degraded reef has gained traction in Mauritius, with microfragmentation serving as a relatively new technique where small coral fragments are mounted in off-site nurseries using concrete blocks, galvanized structures, and natural basaltic rocks to support coral growth. Early monitoring at the restoration site has shown an increase in local biodiversity, and an additional 1,890 coral fragments are currently being propagated in the coral nursery to expand the restoration area. With the site's designation as a Voluntary Marine Conservation Area (VMCA), the momentum for revitalizing biodiversity in the reef ecosystem using the power of technology and partnerships is accelerating. ""Collaboration between public institutions and the private sector is increasingly necessary to determine success in the face of complex environmental challenges,"" said James Hardcastle, Head of Protected and Conserved Areas Team for IUCN. ""We have the opportunity to take advantage of technological innovations and incorporate them into conservation measures for our ecosystems. This project exemplifies how cooperation and mainstreaming are the way forward to halt biodiversity loss."" ""This project is the first of its kind that we are investing in Mauritius, after dozens of successful experiences of developing solutions to protect different species and natural spaces in countries around the world using advanced technologies such as cloud, AI, and connectivity,"" said Zheng Kui, CEO of Huawei Mauritius. ""The role of the technology industry in meeting this challenge is key, but only through collaboration with strategic and committed partners can the objectives be achieved in a real way."" It is hoped that this project can be replicated in other areas of Mauritius and balance the needs of tourism and conservation. And with up to 50% of the world's coral reef already destroyed or degraded, the project's success to date demonstrates the value of further large-scale global reef restoration supported by digital technology.

Release of Netflix original featuring late singer Sulli could be imminent,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3151949,2023.06.23 11:45,"A Netflix original film featuring late singer Sulli received its mandatory age certification Friday, indicating its imminent release. According to The Korea Media Rating Board, the second part of a series of omnibus films by four different directors, “Persona: Sulli,” will be available to viewers 15 years old or older. The movie, which has four parts in four different genres, is 2 hours and 10 minutes long. The first part of “Persona” opened in 2019, with the directors each making a short film featuring singer and actor IU as the main protagonist. Netflix said last month that the company was currently talking about the possible release of the film after “Persona” starring Sulli has been introduced on Netflix Brazil’s catalog for upcoming content, fueling anticipation among fans that they will get another glimpse of their idol on screen. Sulli continued her career as part of a K-pop girl group f(X) following her acting debut in 2005. But she took her own life in 2019 at the age of 25. At the time, her death was described as “murder by fingertips,” as she had long been the target of online vitriol for defying social norms -- from wearing a shirt without a bra in public and being candid about her romantic relationships, to livestreaming a drinking session with friends.

NABR Files Petition Challenging the Listing of Long-Tailed Macaque by the IUCN,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3147505,2023.06.16 15:10,"WASHINGTON, June 16, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Working with recognized, independent scientists, the National Association for Biomedical Research (NABR) filed a petition today with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) challenging the recent designation of the long-tailed macaque (Cynomolgus macaque) as endangered under IUCN listing criteria. This designation is a result of improperly used data that do not support species listing as endangered. NABR calls for an immediate review. National Association for Biomedical Research President Matthew R. Bailey said: ""Nonhuman primates make up less than 0.5% of all animals in research, yet they play a critical role in developing new drugs, devices and vaccines for people and for pets. Tens of thousands of drugs and therapeutics may never make it through the research and development pipeline without long-tailed macaques in research. The listing of long-tailed macaques and any ensuing importation restrictions must be based on the best available scientific evidence. Arbitrary restrictions imposed on the importation of long-tailed macaques could jeopardize millions of human lives and threaten global public health."" ""The listing of the long-tailed macaque as endangered by the IUCN sets a dangerous precedent because this determination is not based on peer-reviewed scientific information. This is particularly troubling because arbitrary actions like this make life-saving medical research even more difficult to conduct in the U.S. and other countries."" The IUCN assessment completed in 2022 fails to present scientific evidence supporting reclassification of the long-tailed macaque from vulnerable to endangered. The IUCN assessment contains numerous errors and misstatements, and does not provide actual evidence of species declines compared to past evaluations. Nonhuman primates are currently irreplaceable in neuroscience, neurodegenerative disorders, infectious diseases, immunotherapy, reproduction, aging, chronic inflammatory disease and other areas of science. Since nonhuman primates and humans share between 93% and 98% of the same DNA, have similar brain anatomies, and share similar body systems, they are a key to biomedical research discoveries that yield new drugs, vaccines and biologics. The overwhelming majority of drugs on the market today relied on safety and efficacy data from multiple animal models before being allowed to move to human clinical trials as demonstrated by the Foundation for Biomedical Research's top 25 drugs and animal models study. National Association for Biomedical Research President Matthew R. Bailey will testify before the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora Animals Committee meeting in Geneva on Monday, June 19, 2023, calling for a review of the endangered listing. BACKGROUND Long-tailed macaques are used extensively in medical research to develop drugs in the United States. The National Academies report Nonhuman Primate Models in Biomedical Research: State of the Science and Future Needs (2023) emphasizes that animal testing followed by human clinical trials currently remains the best way to examine complex physiological, neuroanatomical, reproductive, developmental and cognitive effects of drugs to determine if they are safe and effective for market approval. The major regulatory agencies across the world, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, require most new drugs and biologics to be evaluated for measures of safety and efficacy with rodent and non-rodent animal models, including nonhuman primates, before human clinical trials can safely begin. On March 7, 2022, the IUCN determined that the long-tailed macaque should be considered ""endangered"" under IUCN criteria. The basis for this determination is outlined in an assessment completed by M.F. Hansen and other contributors (Hansen et al. 2022). On June 15, 2023, NABR filed a petition with the IUCN challenging the change in listing status. Scientists involved in drafting the petition note the lack of data to support the recent status determination. In its review of Hansen et al. (2022) the petition notes that scientific literature referenced is often misinterpreted and such information does not demonstrate that the long-tailed macaque has declined. The filing of this petition by NABR triggers a scientific review by the IUCN. During this review, scientists will review the best available scientific information to determine the status of the long-tailed macaque under IUCN criteria. At the conclusion of this process, the IUCN will announce its findings, and any changes in listing status. About the National Association for Biomedical Research Founded in 1979, the National Association for Biomedical Research (NABR) is the only 501(c)(6) nonprofit association dedicated to sound public policy for the humane use of animals in biomedical research, education and testing. Members include more than 340 universities, medical and veterinary schools, teaching hospitals, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, patient groups, and academic and professional societies who rely on humane and responsible animal research to advance global human and animal health.

Star-studded summer blockbuster films to compete in August,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3144335,2023.06.12 14:00,"A number of star-studded blockbuster films will vie for audience attention this summer, raising expectations that the projects might bring local moviegoers back to theaters after the majority of films released this year have performed worse than expected at the box office. ""Unofficial Operation,"" an action flick starring Ha Jung-woo and Ju Ji-hoon, will open Aug. 2, according to the film distributor Showbox. The film revolves around Min-joon (Ha), a diplomat who departs for war-torn Lebanon to search for a missing colleague. If successful, he will be given his dream post in the US. In Lebanon, Min-joon meets a Korean taxi driver, Pan-soo (Ju), who is fluent in Arabic and looks like a swindler. Set in 1987, the film is directed by Kim Sung-hoon, who has also helmed the Netflix hit “Kingdom,” as well as action flicks “A Hard Day” (2014) and “Tunnel” (2016). Also opening on Aug. 2 is ""The Moon,"" a long-waited film by hit filmmaker Kim Yong-hwa, that stars Sol Kyung-gu, Kim Hee-ae and Do Kyung-soo. “The Moon” tells the story of Seon-woo (Do), a member of a space project crew who is accidentally left behind and isolated on the Moon, and former space center chief Jae-kook's (Sol) adventure to the Moon to rescue Seon-woo. The film is director Kim’s first movie set in space, after producing the very successful ""Along with the Gods” (2017), (2018). Meanwhile, director Ryoo Seung-wan’s much-anticipated “Smugglers” opens a week earlier on July 26. Set in the 1970s in a peaceful seaside village, this crime action film features an accident in front of ""haenyeo,"" female divers who collect mollusks from the ocean floor. Actors Kim Hye-soo, Yeom Jeong-ah, Zo In-sung, Park Jung-mi and Go Min-si star in the film. With the confirmation of the summer blockbuster films' release in July and August, the market expectation is high for ticket sales to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels. There have been concerns about resurgence of local cinemas as streaming services like Netflix enjoy increasing popularity. Among the dozens of films released so far this year, just three films -- ""The Point Men,"" starring Hwang Jung-min and Hyun Bin; and “Dream,” featuring Park Seo-jun and IU -- drew more than 1 million moviegoers. “The Roundup: No Way Out,"" which opened May 31, surpassed the 7-million admissions mark over the weekend.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/06/12/20230612000526_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
"Huawei, IUCN and Global Partners Highlight Latest Technology for Nature Protection",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3141315,2023.06.06 05:10,"3rd Tech4Nature Summit held on 50th anniversary of World Environment Day SHENZHEN, China, June 5, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- On the 50th anniversary of World Environment Day, Huawei and IUCN highlighted smart solutions for supporting effective and fair management and governance of protected and conserved areas, and the growing importance of technology in tracking threatened species and protecting their natural habitats. Huawei and IUCN outlined a vision for protected and conserved areas, to leverage digital technology to help achieve global biodiversity goals. At the summit, the Smart Protected Areas White Paper was launched, jointly developed by Huawei, IUCN China and the Chinese Academy of Forestry, to share the blueprint for building smart protected areas, based on experience from China's protected areas. The key to wildlife protection is understanding distribution, behaviors, seasonal trends of species, and how human activities may impact their patterns. This requires extensive data, which can be challenging to attain given remote and hard-to-access areas, often exacerbated by extreme weather. Early data collection and research efforts relied on scientists going into the field to install camera traps to capture images. These cameras needed to be maintained, their batteries replaced, and their memory cards replaced and analyzed; time - and labor-intensive processes that frequently resulted in data and images that were several months old. Implementing next-generation digital technologies, such as cloud computing, IoT, mobile Internet, big data, and AI enables real-time data acquisition and interaction. This is key to improving smart sensing, analysis and management of species protection and area-based conservation efforts, making them more effective and thereby better at conserving nature. Since 2019, Huawei has worked alongside over 30 global partners, including IUCN, to apply digital technologies to achieve effective conservation and restoration outcomes in 46 protected and conserved areas worldwide, from tropical rainforests in China's Hainan - home to the world's rarest gibbon, to wetland oasis in Italy, and coral reefs off the east coast of Mauritius. For example, under Tech4Nature in Mexico where Huawei partners with IUCN, C-Minds, Polytechnic University of Yucatan, Rainforest Connection, and the local community of Dzilam has collected more than 30,000 photos, 550,000 audio recordings and numerous video clips of wild animals. An algorithm was developed and trained to help identify the different species, especially the jaguar, and to date, the team has identified 119 species, including 5 individual jaguars. ""We have gained a lot in the past three years of cooperation, during which time Huawei has worked with us to demonstrate the responsible use of new technologies in protecting nature. IUCN looks forward to longer-term collaboration with Huawei as a tech leader to help achieve global goals such as the target to conserve at least 30% of the Earth's land and water by 2030"", said Dr Grethel Aguilar, Deputy Director General for IUCN. The primary aim of the Smart Protected Areas White Paper is to realize the effective conservation of protected areas and the sustainable management of natural resources. Based on this target, the white paper identifies seven major scenarios, including ecological protection and restoration, resource management, and scientific research amongst others. In these identified scenarios, four key capabilities need to be implemented, which includes comprehensive, multi-dimensional ecological sensing, integrated multi-network communications that can adapt to complex terrain, intelligent analysis that can process massive amounts of data from multiple sources, and the capability to apply analytical results to the operations and management of protected areas. This blueprint proposes a comprehensive solution architecture for smart protected areas based on the latest developments in digital technology. ""Biodiversity loss and climate change are two interrelated global environmental crises that require coordinated responses. While protecting nature, science and technology can also help thousands of industries with green development and better cope with climate change,"" said Tao Jingwen, Huawei's Director of the Board and Chairman of Corporate Sustainable Development (CSD) Committee. Peng Song, Senior Vice President and President of Huawei's ICT Strategy & Marketing Department, said, ""The Earth is our only home. Digital technologies can help protect nature reserves more effectively and promote the sustainable management of natural resources. Our original intention is to sum up the practice of science and technology in helping protect nature and to work with partners to promote the intelligent construction of more nature reserves."" According to the WEF's New Nature Economy Report, more than half of the world's GDP, about US$44 trillion, relies on nature and the services it provides. However, climate change and biodiversity loss are threatening the survival and sustainable development of humanity. A new nature economy could generate up to $10.1 trillion in annual business value and create 395 million jobs by 2030 To explore the future potential of smart nature conservation, the summit brought together TECH4ALL partners, including the Yucatan state government of Mexico, the Mexican innovation agency C Minds, IUCN China, WWF Italy, Rainforest Connection, and Shandong Yellow River Delta National Nature Reserve.

"Live music is finally back, but K-pop fans feel let down",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3133840,2023.05.25 16:40,"K-pop concerts in hot water over disappointing experience, pricing issues Live music has returned as the pandemic peters out, but its return has been accompanied by higher ticket prices and with a slew of unexpected problems the fans did not pay for. Just this month, the internet was abuzz following news that a Malaysian lawyer was suing the organizer of K-pop band Blackpink's concerts in his county. Lawyer Nas Rahman bought two tickets for the band's Kuala Lumpur show from its ""Born Pink"" world tour. However, on the day of the concert, he discovered that one of the two seats he had paid for did not exist. Rahman had to sit and stand throughout the nearly two-hour show. Despite attempts to negotiate with the show's organizer, Live Nation and Go Live, for a refund and some compensation for his discomfort, he couldn't reach an agreement with the company and decided to sue them instead, seeking compensation of up to 1 million Malaysian ringgit ($218,000). Rahman's experience is not an isolated case, with similar complaints coming to light following the quartet's Singapore concert on May 13. After the night ended, fans shared their disappointing experience online, complaining that they could barely see the stage. A TikTok comment left by a fan who claimed to have bought a VIP ticket for 398 Singapore dollars ($295) read, ""This was my first time going to a concert and I saw nothing but their arms,"" while another wrote, ""(I) paid $300 to watch Blackpink from people's phones."" Tickets hit by pandemic inflation Complaints from fans also focus on the prices of the tickets themselves, with the hyper-inflated prices for gigs now becoming the norm for K-pop fans. Earlier this month, Thai media MRG Online reported the average price of K-pop concert tickets sold locally this year for around 5,270 baht ($156), up almost 18 percent from the average price of 4,470 baht in 2019 before the pandemic and up 60 percent from 2013. Outraged Thai fans had taken the issue to the Consumer Protection Agency. Fans of boy band Stray Kids raised the issue in October, claiming the tickets of the band's February concerts -- the highest priced at 8,500 baht -- were too expensive. The agency, however, said ticket prices are not in its control, explaining the price ""is set based on a consensus between sellers and consumers."" Higher ticket prices are an ongoing issue in South Korea as well. A ticket for Tomorrow X Together's March concert held at the KSPO Dome was 154,000 won ($117) for a regular seat and 198,000 won for a VIP seat. The team's first standalone concert held the previous year in Seoul had all seats sold at 132,000 won. Last year's most expensive K-pop concert in Korea was Blackpink's show held in October at the KSPO Dome, which sold tickets in packages with prices ranging from 154,000 won to 264,000 won. The group's 2018 gig held at the same venue was priced at 110,000 won per ticket. Fans complain that the labels are taking advantage of their support for the artists. The burden weighs on the consumers even more as the ticket purchase is only the first step of the concert spree. A light-stick -- a must-have item in order to fully enjoy the show these days -- adds 20,000 to 50,000 won to the ticket price. Fans say they are often forced to get a new one as the remotely-controlled item gets upgraded every now and then. Taking an old version, you might find yourself shaking a stick which flashes the wrong color at the wrong time. Bad behavior continues Despite bloated prices, fans still pay, becoming an easy target of ticket scalpers. Scalping has always existed in the world of concerts, but the phenomenon has grown in both scale and number, so much so that it is now coming under legal control. Taiwan recently passed a law to punish ticket scalpers. The amendment to the country's Development of the Cultural and Creative Industries Act was made after a ticket for Blackpink's Kaohsiung concert surged as high as 400,000 Taiwanese dollars ($13,000), nearly 45 times its original price. The amendment made it so that anyone who attempts to sell tickets at a price higher than face value would be slapped with a fine up to a maximum of 50 times the original fee, even stipulating a jail term of under three years and a fine of NT$3 million to be imposed on those caught snatching tickets illegally via automated programs. Some artists have taken matters into their own hands, with singer IU among those who have taken the strictest measure. For her ""Golden Hour"" concert held in Seoul last September, the singer's agency restricted all ticket trading outside of the official platform regardless of the profit gained. The company also received reports of scalping and yielded the collected ticket to the reporter, while permanently blacklisting perpetrators from official membership and future concerts. Dynamic pricing not a solution To tackle ticket scalping, more local labels are considering the so-called dynamic pricing system -- the latest hot topic issue among K-pop fans. Dynamic pricing enables ticket prices to fluctuate based on demand. While mostly used by the world's biggest live music company Live Nation's ticketing platform Ticketmaster, more local labels are also opting for it. Hybe recently announced its implementation, the first among the local labels, while Blackpink's UK shows last year were also sold on a dynamic pricing-basis. Hybe introduced the new pricing system with BTS' member Suga's US tour. A fan on Twitter said she paid $867 for a ticket, more than double its opening price of $350, while another claimed to have seen the price surge to nearly $1,000. Critics say firms should be more cautious in adopting the system in respect to the unique culture and environment of the K-pop industry. ""K-pop is essentially run by the fandom. Dynamic pricing benefits the company and artists by taking more from the fans, forcing fans to show their love for the artists by paying more,"" South Korean pop music critic Kim Heon-sik told The Korea Herald. Kim denounced Hybe's decision to introduce dynamic pricing, saying ""it's almost like a game of chicken."" ""Fans have to pay blind money for the ticket, and in doing so, competing with each other. The system forces them to turn their backs on other fans and eventually on their own artists,"" Kim added, stressing there must be a reasonable ceiling to cap the spike. Negative sentiments are already spreading fast among fans. While Tour Data on Thursday announced that Suga is the first rapper to earn over $3 million in a single arena-concert in US history, a fan said she feels ""on the fence"" about his achievement. ""Seeing as this was achieved through dynamic pricing, I have no doubt our Suga would have achieved this without the practice,"" the fan wrote on her Twitter, adding, ""It's sad that a lot of fans had to potentially go into debt to pay for this."" Using the system is their choice, but the price for it will be shared by the consumers and the whole industry, critics added. ""In K-pop, when one company starts something new, the rest tend to follow. So it's likely that dynamic pricing will become more common, but I'm worried it will harm the industry,"" Jung Min-jae, another Seoul-based pop music critic, said in a phone interview. Those who benefit will see profit, while others will be priced out eventually. ""Ticket prices have surged following the pandemic, and that in itself is already weighing on the artists. Many singers who held sold-out shows in the past aren't able to this year because of the spike in ticket prices. It's time that companies address the issue, (taking into account) what is good for the artists in the long term,"" Jung warned.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/05/24/20230524000867_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Huawei and Partners Announce First Confirmed Jaguars in Mexico's Dzilam State Reserve,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3131817,2023.05.22 20:10,"AI-powered system confirms at least five jaguars in Dzilam State Reserve MEXICO CITY, May 22, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- A team of nature conservation experts announced that they have identified at least five jaguars in Dzilam State Reserve in Yucatan, Mexico. Enabled by Huawei's cloud platform and AI, the team have identified two adult males, one adult female, and two cubs as part of a Tech4Nature project launched by IUCN and Huawei in Dzilam State Reserve in 2022. Prior to the project, experts did not know whether the reserve was home to jaguars and if so, how many there were. ""Our umbrella species is the jaguar, because if we protect it, then we protect everything that surrounds them. What we are doing is a huge and pioneering step for decision-making for conservation and nature-based solutions,"" said Regina Cervera, Project Coordinator at the innovation agency C Minds. The project utilizes infrared cameras, audio monitoring devices, cloud, and AI to collect, monitor, and analyze acoustic and visual data that gives a baseline understanding of the presence of 25 species, one of which is the endangered North American jaguar - an umbrella species that indicates the health of the whole ecosystem. The data collected is processed on Huawei's ModelArts AI platform and Rainforest Connection's Arbimon AI platform. ""We need to upload the data to a big data platform because of the high volume of information,"" said Joaquin Saldana, Director of Strategy Marketing at Huawei Latin America. ""We need to process it at high speed and with artificial intelligence. Then we can start to understand the data and detect the animals that interest us."" Alongside C Minds and Huawei Mexico, project partners include International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Polytechnic University of Yucatan, Rainforest Connection, the government authorities of Yucatan, and local community groups. ""The Tech4Nature project in Mexico is a successful example of how local communities use innovative technologies for biodiversity conservation,"" said Nadine Seleem, Green List Project Leader at IUCN. With 30,000 images, 550,000 audio recordings, and extensive video footage collected and analyzed to date, the Tech4Nature partners have identified 119 species. These include 88 birds, 22 mammals, five reptiles, and four amphibians. Of these, 34 species are on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The data also provides a rich array of data-driven insights for researchers to develop conservation measures based on a far more complete understanding of the ecosystem as a whole. ""Knowing is extremely valuable, which is what we get now with monitoring. If we do not see them, we do not know they are there. If people do not know about these animals, they cannot help us,"" said Sayda Rodriguez Gomez, Secretary of Sustainable Development of Yucatan. Protecting the jaguar is of high importance to the surrounding communities and their involvement in the project is crucial. ""This is jaguar territory. If we do not protect this habitat, we will only find these jaguars in books,"" said Juan Castillo, a community leader in Dzilam de Bravo. Mexico's jaguars are threatened by poaching, deforestation, habitat loss, and climate change. Ecologists estimate that around 4,000 to 5,000 jaguars live in the wild in Mexico, more than half of which live in Yucatan Peninsula, making the area one of the nation's primary regions for conservation. The team are currently working on developing algorithms that can identify individual jaguars, based on which population numbers can be more accurately calculated. On World Environment Day on June 5, IUCN and Huawei will host the third Tech4Nature webinar themed ""Smarter Biodiversity Conservation"". At the event, government, conservation, and technology experts will explore how technology can make nature conservation smarter and showcase current innovations and achievements in this area. IUCN and Huawei will also launch the Smart Protected Areas whitepaper that can help enable smarter nature conservation. About Tech4Nature Huawei and the International Union for Conservation of nature (IUCN) jointly launched the three-year Tech4Nature partnership in 2020 to measure the efficacy of nature conservation using digital technologies against the IUCN green list standard. Tech4Nature comes under Huawei's digital inclusion and sustainability initiative TECH4ALL. About TECH4ALL TECH4ALL is Huawei's long-term digital inclusion initiative and action plan.

"IU hit with plagiarism attacks, continues legal battle",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3124735,2023.05.12 19:23,"Agency Edam Entertainment vows to take strict measures against indiscrimiante accusations Singer-actor IU's agency on Friday denied all plagiarism allegations and pledged legal measures against those responsible. Edam Entertainment released an official statement on Friday after reviewing the accusations and the recent plagiarism case filed against the artist. On Wednesday, it was reported that someone had filed a complaint to the local police against IU on charges of plagiarism regarding six of her songs. ""Based on comprehensive data that we collected from the media and the investigative authorities, the accuser is not making allegations of plagiarism against the songwriters, but solely IU,"" the statement read. It continued, saying, ""The fact that an unrelated third person sued only the vocalist, IU, even though some of the composers denied the allegations, shows that the person is only trying to damage the artist's (IU's) reputation."" Edam Entertainment had also issued an official statement on Wednesday following reports that IU was sued. Edam said then that it recently began a legal fight against people writing malicious comments and spreading false rumors about the artist online. ""While monitoring, we were astounded and shocked to discover that someone had filed a lawsuit for plagiarism,"" the agency said on Friday, adding, ""We will hold the accuser who filed this indiscriminate case accountable for the results."" In the complaint, the accuser asserted that six of IU's songs -- ""Boo"" (2009), ""Pitiful"" (2009), ""Growing Up,"" ""Good Day"" (2010), ""The Red Shoes"" (2013), ""Bbibbi"" (2018) and ""Celebrity"" (2021) -- are suspected of copying other songs. Maeil Business, the local newspaper which first reported the case, cited the complaint, which said the songs ""showed similarity with other original songs in the melody, rhythm and the chord progression."" In the case of ""Good Day"" and ""The Red Shoes,"" the complaint reportedly claimed that ""the resemblances are so significant that it can be discerned even by an ordinary person."" On Thursday, some of the songwriters of the six songs released statements denying the allegations. Producer Lee Min-su, who composed ""Good Day"" and ""The Red Shoes,"" wrote on his social media: ""I did not refer to, nor have in mind works by others when I made the songs."" ""The Red Shoes"" was previously accused of plagiarism in 2013 when German rock band Nektar claimed the song resembled its song ""Here's Us"" in some parts. Lee denied the accusation then, and other reputable local musicians, including Hybe founder Bang Si-hyuk and star composer Kim Hyeong-seok, stood up for him as well. Composer Lee Jong-hoon of ""Bbibbi"" also said through his social media on Thursday that he ""did not copy any other song,"" and went on to slam the accuser for choosing the wrong target to sue. ""Copyright violations should be referred to the songwriter and not the singer. If necessary, the suit should have been filed against me, the composer, in the first place,"" Lee said in his post. He also pointed out that plagiarism can only be punished at the victim's request. ""The complaint holds no legal force when filed by a third party. It's clear that someone is only trying to harm the artist's reputation regardless of the legal consequences,"" the composer said. Edam Entertainment added it is also cooperating with the composers closely in dealing with the current situation and stressed it would take strict measures against all indiscriminate accusations.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/05/12/20230512000560_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
"IU denies plagiarism allegations, takes legal action",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3121907,2023.05.10 17:02,"Singer-songwriter IU is refuting allegations of plagiarism, and is taking legal action against those raising the allegations. IU's agency Edam Entertainment on Wednesday afternoon said in a press statement that it has pressed charges over continued malicious behavior against the singer online. ""For several months we have been aware that posts alleging plagiarism and carrying false rumors based on unverified claims have been spreading via online communities, social media and YouTube,"" the agency said in the statement on Wednesday. According to the statement, the alleged illegal acts against IU ranged from plagiarism accusations to spy rumors, sexual harassment, defamation, the spreading of false rumors and privacy infringement. ""We have been collecting data (about such behavior), and ... based on the data, have filed a complaint to the investigative authority,"" the statement continued. Edam's statement comes a few hours after a local news report claimed IU was recently sued over allegations of plagiarism. According to a report by Maeil Business -- a local economic daily -- an anonymous person on Monday filed a complaint against IU to Seoul Gangnam Police Station accusing the singer of copyrights violations, claiming six of IU's songs are suspected of copying other local and foreign songs. The news report listed ""Boo"" and ""Pitiful"" from her 2009 debut studio album ""Growing Up,"" ""Good Day"" (2010), ""The Red Shoes"" (2013), ""Bbibbi"" (2018) and ""Celebrity"" (2021) as being cited in the police complaint. Directly quoting the complaint, the report said, ""These songs are similar with the original songs in the melody, rhythm and the chord progression. And in the case of 'Good Day' and 'The Red Shoes,' the resemblances are so significant that it can be discerned even by an ordinary person."" The cited quote continued, stating, ""All six songs show signs of plagiarism in the introductory part, which plays a decisive role in forming a song's overall atmosphere and identity, as well as catching the listeners' attention to make them play the song."" Speaking to Maeil Business, the anonymous accuser claimed that IU remained silent on the issue despite the repeated allegations, and that the singer tried to delete the posts and content raising such issues based on copyright infringements. Edam said it has not been officially notified by the police about the reported claim. ""We only became aware that such a complaint had been filed through the news report. We have not yet seen what the complaint says and are still in the process of verifying it,"" the agency added. Meanwhile, ""Celebrity"" is the only song among the aforementioned six that IU took part in creating as a songwriter. ""The Read Shoes"" and ""Good Day"" were written solely by composer Lee Min-soo, ""Boo"" by Han Sang-won and ""Bbibbi"" by Lee Jong-hoon. The melody of ""Pitiful"" was co-written by Choi Gap-won and PJ, while ""Celebrity"" was composed mainly by producer Ryan Jhun.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/05/10/20230510000740_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

TECH4ALL: Driving Inclusion and Sustainability with Partnerships,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3110904,2023.04.22 10:10,"- Huawei and its global partners hosted a media roundtable at HAS2023 SHENZHEN, China, April 22, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- At a media roundtable held yesterday at Huawei Global Analyst Summit 2023, Huawei and its global partners shared the latest TECH4ALL practices and discussed how digital technology enables a more inclusive and sustainable digital world. During the session, several of Huawei's global TECH4ALL partners also made updates on projects that are currently running across the globe. A key message was that for each project, the powerful combination of technology and partnerships has been fundamental to driving positive outcomes. ""All our efforts in TECH4ALL initiatives have only been possible due to the combination of technology and partnerships,"" said Jeffrey Zhou, President of ICT Marketing for Huawei in his opening remarks at the roundtable. Since the initiative's launch in 2019, Huawei has worked closely with governments, customers, international organizations, research institutes, and NGOs to make the social value of digital technology as far-reaching as possible. Driving Equity and Quality in Education To drive inclusion and help build sustainable futures, TECH4ALL education projects have so far reached 220,000 beneficiaries globally. Priority beneficiaries are remote and rural communities and underserved groups, including women and girls, unemployed youth, people with disabilities, the elderly, and K12 students and teachers. During the roundtable, YouChange China Social Entrepreneur Foundation shared its vision underlining how technology-based support platforms empower early-career teachers in rural areas by providing online training to develop their professional capabilities and confidence. ""The greatest development is the development of human beings. In the future, we would love to continue working with Huawei, enhancing rural education through technology,"" said Hui Ling, Secretary General for YouChange China Social Entrepreneur Foundation. Conserving Nature with Technology In the area of sustainability and nature conservation, TECH4ALL projects have helped conserve biodiversity efficiently and manage natural resources sustainably in 46 protected areas across the globe, including 5 pilot projects under the Tech4Nature partnership set up in 2020 between Huawei and International Union for Conservation of Nature. ""When we talk about biodiversity and area-based conservation, technology can really help us in assisting in monitoring and strengthening reporting on biodiversity, climate and area-based conservation targets,"" said Khalid Pasha, Asia Coordinator, IUCN Asia Regional Office. During the roundtable, TECH4ALL partner C Minds shared on the Mexico Tech4Nature project. Launched in May 2022 with IUCN, C Minds and other local partners, the project is harnessing the power of AI and community centered approaches to safeguard biodiversity in the Dzilam State Reserve, including the endangered North American jaguar. ""The use of technologies provides the ability to scale up conservation action to unprecedented levels and ensure shorter time frames, which we achieved in this case, that the results of years of manual tagging and data interpretation were achieved in less than 1 year of working together with technology and partnerships. It also provides the ability to create transparent and measurable impact,"" said Regina Cervera Pacheco, Project Coordinator for C Minds. Using ICT to Boost Rural Development ITU-D also attended the session to update on the Smart Village Pakistan project. Launched in January 2023, this project model accelerates the impact of multiple SDGs by increasing last-mile access and provides remote villages with access to a range of digital services, including e-health, e-education, and e-commerce with a view to improving the quality of life and economic opportunities. ""Pakistan is ITU's first smart village programme in Asia Pacific under the Smart Villages and Smart Islands initiative. We are very proud of partnering with the Government of Pakistan and Huawei in this. These kinds of pilots also bring in new partners, who can bring about even bigger changes. I'd like to thank all those who have stepped in to make this a success."" said Ashish Narayan, Program Coordinator at the ITU Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific.

His second mixtape, “D-2” was unveiled in 2020, led by chart-topping single “Daechwita.” “D-Day” comprises 10 tracks, including lead track “Haegeum” alongside the prerelease track “People Pt. 2 (feat. IU),"" the titular “D-Day,” “HUH?!,” “Amygdala,” “SDL,” “Polar Night,” “Interlude: Dawn,” “Snooze” and “Life Goes On.” “My first solo album ‘D-Day’ marks the concluding chapter of the ‘Agust D’ trilogy. It’s filled with my honest thoughts and melodies that I worked hard on. So I hope you all show a lot of love and support,” Suga said, unveiling the music video for “Haegeum.” In his first official solo album, Suga put out the message that he will concentrate on himself and the present in this era where too much information floods by rapidly. Suga took part in the album from its concept to composition and writing the lyrics of all its tracks. His beliefs and excellent production skills along with collaboration with various musicians across diverse genres enhanced the level of perfection of the album, according to Big Hit Music. In “Haegeum,” Suga again used the sounds of the titular traditional Korean musical instrument. He had used the sound of the string instrument in “Daechwita” from the mixtape “D-2” as well. “Haegeum"" has a double meaning — the name of the instrument itself and also to release verboten things. Suga threw out the topic of “freedom” at people who live under various restrictions and limits in their daily lives and society. And in the track's corresponding music video, Suga plays two different roles at the same time. The two characters -- “Being” and “Exister” -- fight in the music video that looks like a scene straight out of a noir movie. “I recommend that you watch the music videos for 'Daechwita,' 'Haegeum' and 'Amygdala' in one sitting. You’ll be able to see a new side of me, especially in the ‘Haegeum’ music video,” Suga said. Meanwhile, Suga is set to embark on his first solo world tour, with the first concert scheduled for Wednesday at Belmont Park in Long Island, New York. Suga is the first among the seven of BTS to go on a solo world tour. It will likely be his last activity before he starts his mandatory military service.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/04/21/20230421000484_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
"[Herald Review] ‘Dream,’ yet another ‘we did it’ sports film that lacks Lee Byeong-heon’s true colors",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3109451,2023.04.20 18:21,"“Dream,” the country’s third sports comedy film this year, was expected to be different for many reasons. For one, it was director Lee Byeong-heon’s return after helming the country’s highest-grossing comedy, “Extreme Job” (2019). And the star-studded cast including Park Seo-joon and IU and approachable plot based on the real-life event 2012 World Homeless World cup added expectations for a strong comeback. The plot rolls along quickly for the first 20 minutes, showing how Hong-dae (Park), a hot-tempered former soccer player, ended up coaching a group of homeless men who have never played soccer before. But after a promising set-up, “Dream” fails to maintain its grip on the audience's attention for the rest of its 126 minutes. Like many other sports films, it falls into the trap of portraying the underdogs’ stories too dramatically. Lee told reporters during a press conference that this film was particularly difficult as it was a project from long ago. He was also keen to cover homelessness issues carefully. The film is being released eight years after it was conceived. ""I felt it was like a mission for me to resolve bias against (homeless people) and also felt like a homework to find the middle point to not to comically depict that part,” Lee said, adding that he is also curious about how the audience would view his new film. The so-called ""Lee Byeong-heon clique” -- Heo Joon-seok, Kim Jong-soo, Yang Hyun-min, Jung Seung-kil, Lee Hae-woon and Hong Wan-pyo -- does this pretty well. As with his previous hits “Extreme Job” and “Melo is My Nature,” Lee provides them with realistic lines and character buildup without exaggeration, and the actors make good use of the material, with naturalistic depictions of their characters. The trouble seems to start with the two lead actors, both working with Lee for the first time. Park struggles to show his usual flair, and IU is lumbered with a role that doesn't play to her strengths. “Dream” was shot before Hirokazu Kore-eda's award-winning “Broker,” so in a way, this is her first-ever film. Her transition to the silver screen was a natural one after successful TV roles in “My Mister” (2018) and “Hotel del Luna” (2019). But her role as a documentary producer Lee So-min, who follows Hong-dae’s team on its journey to the Homeless World Cup in Hungary, is a poor fit. It does not help that her presence is diminished toward the end of the film, when So-min could have become a more multi-dimensional character and added spice to what, by then, is a flagging storyline. “Dream” opens in theaters on April 26.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/04/20/20230420000728_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

Director Lee Byeong-heon says ‘Dream’ brings both social message and joy,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3093746,2023.03.30 16:16,"Director Lee Byeong-heon behind 2019 hit comedy “Extreme Job” has returned with “Dream,” a sports comedy, which is being released eight years after the film was initially set up. The film tells the story of a Yoon Hong-dae (Park Seo-joon), a professional football player-turned-coach who is put on disciplinary probation after becoming involved in an unexpected incident and tasked with coaching the South Korean national soccer team for the Homeless World Cup. “There was not too much to think about in deciding to make Homeless World Cup into the film, specifically the year 2010 when the Korean team debuted in the competition, because the purpose of this event was very meaningful,” director Lee Byeong-heon told reporters during a press conference held in Megabox Seongsu in Seoul on Thursday. “The competition was created to break the social bias against vulnerable social groups such as alcohol abusers, and the film also contains that message, as well as joy as a comedy film.” He added that it took more than 10 years to finally bring the film to audiences. “When ‘Extreme Job’ became a hit, I felt relieved to finally be able to make this film (in terms of both investment and preparation),” said Lee. Park said to look and act like a professional soccer player, he worked on bulking up and went through intensive training sessions. He added that he can now understand how his best friend and soccer player Son Heung-min is at “another level” after playing this role. Park is returning to the big screen for the first time in four years. The 34-year-old’s most recent film project was the multiple Oscar-winning “Parasite” (2019). He recently finished shooting for an upcoming American superhero film ""The Marvels.” In a way “Dream” is IU's first-ever film, as it was shot before Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s “Broker,” which opened last year. “I wished to play a character that has lived a less eventful life after playing a character with a difficult life (in drama “My Mister”) so when I received the script, I wanted to play the role. Especially with director Lee, I had a conviction to participate in this comedy project,” said IU. IU stars as a documentary show producer Lee So-min who spends time with Hong-dae’s team and follows its journey to the Homeless World Cup tournament in Budapest, Hungary. Lee Hyun-woo, Ko Chang-seok, Heo Joon-seok, Kim Jong-soo, Yang Hyun-min, Jung Seung-kil, Lee Hae-woon and Hong Wan-pyo also star as soccer team members. “Dream” hits local theaters on April 26.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/03/30/20230330000743_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
[Herald Review] ‘Rebound’: a basketball film about overcoming setbacks,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3092996,2023.03.29 15:37,"“Rebound” doesn’t just tell the real-life story of an underdog basketball team making it all the way to the championships – the film itself overcame real setbacks to make it into local theaters. The film, director Jang Hang-jun’s first project in 6 years, will finally open in local theaters after 11 years of setbacks. The film tells the moving story of passionate youths based on a real-life 2012 national high school basketball championship through tense, dynamic scenes. Another strong point of the film is the realistic and convincing portrayals of the basketball players, as actors underwent an audition in which they had to prove their actual skills on the court. When Kang Yang-hyun (Ahn Jae-hong), a former basketball player and public service worker returns to his alma mater as a newly recruited basketball coach to take charge of a team that is on the verge of disbandment, it’s not an easy journey. By calling up students and scouring the streets recruiting players for his team, he finds six players. However, his all his efforts come to naught when the team gets a six month-ban from participating in the nationwide championship. After starting from square one by reorganizing the team and training the players with a brand-new player-centered strategy, the Busan JungAng High School’s basketball team makes it to the national championship finals, beating five strong teams and losing for the first time in the league to the four-time champion, Yongsan High School. As the title suggests, the film is about overcoming setbacks. In basketball, a rebound is when a when a player gets possession of the ball directly after a missed shot. “The whole process of the production was a ‘rebound’ in itself. After the production company began brainstorming the film in 2012, it took 11 years to release the film. After I took charge of this film’s direction five years ago, the production also faltered at one point due to investment issues. I couldn’t feel any more grateful than I do today,” director Jang told reporters after film’s screening held at CGV I-Park Yongsan in Seoul on Tuesday. The focus of production was about making an “easy” basketball film. “I tried my best to make a basketball film with a storyline that even people who don’t know the game too well can easily follow along with. The method I used was to feature commentators to deliver explanations of the game,” Jang said. Jang added that he hopes to see the film reinvigorate the local movie scene. “We decided to release the film in April from long ago, but figured out that more films related to sports are opening close to our release date. Maybe distribution firms didn’t consider my film as too threatening,” he joked. Meanwhile, other sports films are scheduled to be releases next month. “Air,” a biographical sports drama film directed by Ben Affleck and written by Alex Convery on sports retail giant Nike will also be released on April 5. The South Korean film “Dream,” directed by Lee Byeong-heon and starring Park Seo-joon and IU, will be released on April 26. “Rebound” hits local theaters on April 5.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/03/29/20230329000646_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Tech4Nature: Why Healthy Forests Mean Healthy People,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3086940,2023.03.22 00:50,"SHENZHEN, China, March 21, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Themed 'Forests and Health', this year's International Day of Forests on March 21 is a call for humanity to consider its relationship with the Earth's forests and the direct impact they have on our longevity and well-being. Many people are familiar with the metaphor that forests are the lungs of the planet, breathing out clean air and serving as vital carbon sinks that mitigate the effects of climate change. Fewer, however, are aware of the intrinsic links that forests have with our day-to-day health. Did you know? As well as the planet's lungs, forests are also nature's pharmacy and larder. They provide us with around 25% of western medicines, with upwards of 50,000 plants contributing to modern drugs. And a study of 27 African countries shows that children exposed to forests had 25% greater diet diversity thanks to an abundance of fruit, vegetables, bush meat, fish, and edible oils. But the prognosis for forests is alarming. Around 35% of the world's forest cover has been lost, with 82% of the remainder degraded. The rapidity and extent of these threats require long-term, committed intervention. A story of protection One way technology is protecting forest ecosystems is by preventing illegal logging, which accounts for up to 90% of all logging activities and is a major contributor to global deforestation. In Similajau National Park in Malaysia's Sarawak state, we are working with the Sarawak Forest Department and Sarawak Forestry Corporation to enable the Sarawak government to protect its rainforests. The park is not just rich in biodiversity, it is also a sustainable source of medicine and food for local people, many of whom depend on the forest for their livelihoods. However, illegal logging remains a prominent threat, causing widespread degradation of the rainforest ecosystem and biodiversity loss. Now, though, there is hope. 'Guardian' acoustic monitoring devices can detect the sound of trucks and chainsaws used for illegal logging. Each Guardian can cover an area of 7 km and send networked real-time alerts via a cloud platform to rangers' phones, enabling real-time intervention. Audio and visual monitoring technology and AI analytics can also help monitor endangered species through their vocalizations. By tracking their populations and distribution, conservationists can develop precise conservation measures. Of particular interest are umbrella species, the well-being of which is pivotal to the health of the forest ecosystems they inhabit. Examples of biodiversity monitoring projects that target umbrella species include Darwin's foxes in Chile and jaguars in Mexico's Dzilam State Reserve. Technology can also trigger smart conservation action in forested areas. In Switzerland, a pilot Tech4Nature project in partnership with IUCN and Porini Foundation uses blockchain to develop a system to trace carbon sequestration to boost the transparency and traceability of forest carbon sink transactions, with a view to using these credits to fund other biodiversity conservation projects. The above are examples of forest ecosystem protection projects under Huawei's TECH4ALL initiative. Together with global partners, technological solutions have been developed comprising audio and visual monitoring devices, communication networks, cloud, and AI analytics. These can achieve conservation outcomes that would have been impossible even a decade ago. With scientific evidence strongly correlating forest health and human health, it is imperative that we keep our forests healthy. Our experience so far shows that this approach is working. And that knowledge drives us to keep striving with our partners to help build a healthy, sustainable future for both us and our forests.

SM allots right to distribute albums and tracks exclusively to Kakao Entertainment,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3067264,2023.02.23 18:22,"SM Entertainment is allotting the right to distribute its albums and music exclusively to Kakao Entertainment, the subsidiary of the IT giant Kakao, with whom it has recently formed a strategic partnership to foster its new business project SM 3.0. The K-pop powerhouse revealed the details of the business partnership formed early this month on Wednesday via its official YouTube channel. Under the deal, Kakao is to acquire a 9.05 percent stake in SM through a paid-in capital increase of 217.2 billion won, buying newly issued shares and convertible bonds. The deal includes SM’s new business strategy to strengthen competitiveness in album and track distribution by utilizing Kakao’s album and track distribution platform and customer channels to maximize profits across SM’s music business areas. The SM 3.0 project involves establishing five different production centers and independent music labels to diversify production. Currently, Dreamus Company which possesses part of SM shares, is responsible for SM’s albums and tracks distribution. Kakao Entertainment is currently responsible for the album and tracks distribution of K-pop stars including IVE, Monsta X, IU and StayC. SM also agreed to distribute its artists’ local concerts and fan meeting tickets through Kakao Entertainment. Previously, SM had announced that it would break away from the maximum number of concerts and live performances cap imposed by the exclusive contract with Dream Maker and increase the number of global concerts per artist to 20 per year, including concerts and fan meetings, and conduct more than 400 concerts per year. As Kakao owns Seoul Arena, under construction to become the country’s first and largest arena dedicated to hosting K-pop performances, it is likely that future SM artists’ concerts would mostly take place here when Kakao finalizes its acquisition of SM shares. The two companies are also discussing jointly establishing a global K-pop group through a global audition held by a jointly established venture. As part of SM’s global strategy, the K-pop powerhouse plans to expand its global coverage by operating an integrated entity and establishing a joint venture with Kakao Entertainment to increase the business feasibility and influence of SM in major global markets. According to industry sources, SM and Kakao Entertainment are known to be targeting the American continent as it is the biggest music market in the world and K-pop’s potential has already been proven by its rival Hybe’s megastar BTS. SM's ambitious road map follows a management right feud between two parties, SM and Kakao on one side and SM founder Lee Soo-man, now the largest SM shareholder Hybe, on the other. Earlier this month, Hybe signed a deal with Lee to buy his 14.8 percent stake in SM for 422.8 billion won, making Hybe the largest shareholder. Hybe is also attempting to buy off minority shareholders’ shares via a tender offer to acquire 40 percent of SM’s total shares for which it will be injecting more than 1 trillion won. SM has since sought to lobby shareholders to make their decision after looking into the overall strategy of SM 3.0, which the company will continue to share before Hybe’s tender offer application deadline on March 1.",,iu
"SM Entertainment to grant Kakao exclusive rights to distribute albums, music: sources",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3069209,2023.02.23 09:48,"SM Entertainment has agreed to give Kakao Entertainment, a subsidiary of technology firm Kakao Corp., exclusive rights to circulate its albums and music as part of its alliance with the tech giant against rival K-pop company Hybe's takeover bid, music industry sources and investment banks said Thursday. They said the transfer of rights was included in a contract Kakao signed earlier this month to buy a 9.05 percent stake in SM through a rights offering and convertible shares and become a strategic partner of SM. Under the deal, SM will grant Kakao Entertainment exclusive rights to distribute Korean albums and music sources and will cooperate to distribute overseas albums and music through the company, according to the sources. Currently, Dreamus Co., of which SM owns part of the shares, is in charge of distributing albums and music of K-pop artists such as Ive, Monsta X, IU, STAYC. SM has also reportedly agreed to cooperate to distribute tickets for domestic concerts and meet-and-greet events for fans of SM-managed artists through Kakao Entertainment. Since the tech giant will operate Seoul Arena, under construction in northern Seoul to become the country's first and largest arena dedicated to staging K-pop performances, it is expected to become a major venue for SM artists' performances if Kakao's acquisition of the stake in SM is made. SM and Kakao Entertainment also reportedly agreed to establish a joint venture company that will hold a joint global audition to create new K-pop groups. The two companies are known to have special interest in American markets, the world's largest and where the rival Hybe has established a solid distribution network backed by the global success of K-pop superstar BTS. Hybe is now the largest shareholder of SM as it completed its acquisition of a 14.8 percent stake in the K-pop agency from its founder Lee Soo-man on Wednesday despite SM's criticism of the purchase as a hostile merger and acquisition to control the firm. Hybe's total stake could increase to almost 40 percent when it purchases a further 25 percent of SM shares from other investors as planned.

"New compound knocks out sperm for hours, research shows",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3068065,2023.02.22 15:20,"Tests on mice suggest first-ever male contraceptive pills are possible Vasectomies are often topics of conversation among couples who have already had enough children or for those who do not want any in the first place. Condoms or abstinence are the only other options for male contraception, while there are several available to women, including hormonal pills, IUD implants, vaginal rings and diaphragms. Recent research results suggest that an on-demand, non-hormonal male contraceptive pill might someday become a reality, as scientists have found a cell pathway, or switch, that temporarily stops sperm from being able to swim. Researchers tested a compound that blocks an enzyme sperm need to swim on mice, finding that it immobilized sperm for a few hours -- long enough to prevent them from reaching the egg. The same enzyme is found in the sperm of many mammals, including humans. According to a paper co-authored by Jochen Buck, a pharmacologist at Weill Cornell Medicine, and published Feb. 14 in the Nature Communications journal, Buck’s lab found the on-switch that turns sperm on to move, and they have now developed a compound which inhibits it. If commercialized after successful clinical trials and government approvals, there would be great potential demand for the epochal drug in South Korea, as well as in other countries, a pharma industry official in Korea said. “We don’t know whether it will be commercialized or how long it may take, but if the drug gets out on the market, it would definitely be a game changer in the world of contraception which has been mostly women’s work so far,” said an official at Boryung Corp., a major pharmaceuticals company that sells contraceptive pills. Although it is too early to say whether it will work on humans, urologists and pharmacologists have reacted positively toward the new compound. According to Buck’s team, within 2.5 hours after injecting the drug, it was 100 percent effective at preventing conception. Within 3.5 hours, it was 91 percent effective. Researchers are now testing the compound on rabbits, and Buck reportedly said he hopes the drug might be available in about eight years from now.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/02/22/20230222000490_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

"Royal Commission for AlUla, Saudi Arabia: ARABIAN LEOPARD DAY LIGHTS UP THE UK & US TO BUILD SUPPORT FOR SAVING A CRITICALLY ENDANGERED SPECIES",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3059566,2023.02.10 20:10,"Arabian Leopard Day 2023 is highlighted by international campaign in the UK and US to raise awareness of a species at risk of extinction Billboard projection appeared overnight in London and New York to raise awareness of Arabian Leopard Day 2023 IUCN rates the Arabian Leopard as Critically Endangered in the wild, with fewer than 200 roaming free A reason for hope: birth of four leopard cubs at a breeding centre in past 22 months ALULA, Saudi Arabia, Feb. 10, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The second annual Arabian Leopard Day on February 10 will feature a strong international component, highlighted by an international campaign to spread international awareness of the species' plight in the UK, US and Saudi Arabia. From today, London will see billboard projections on Piccadilly, High Street Kensington, Canary Wharf, Westfield London, Westfield Stratford City, Skyline - Westfield Stratford City, The Two Towers, Canary Wharf while New Yorkers will see NASDAQ – to mark Arabian Leopard Day. The campaign is spearheaded by the Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU), which is comprehensively regenerating a vast swathe of north-west Arabia as a leading global destination for cultural and natural heritage. RCU and its conservation partners believe that by raising global awareness on Arabian Leopard Day, Feb 10, they can build support for actions to save the species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) ranks the Arabian Leopard as Critically Endangered in the wild, a level of risk more severe than Vulnerable or Endangered. If the population continues to decline, the next stages on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species are Extinct in the Wild and, lastly, Extinct. Dr Stephen Browne, Wildlife & Natural Heritage Executive Director at RCU, said: ""The Arabian Leopard is a formidable symbol of our aim to conserve and safeguard AlUla's natural environment. Unfortunately, the sad reality is that the Arabian Leopard is Critically Endangered with threats to its natural habitat highlighting the pressing need to step up conservation efforts that are so vital to the species' long-term survival. It is our ongoing commitment to mark Arabian Leopard Day and engage with activities to raise awareness of, and help to protect, these magnificent big cats."" To prepare for the eventual return of Arabian Leopards to the wild, RCU has released native species of prey animals into vast nature reserves, increased efforts to track and protect wild leopards, and regenerated natural areas managed by teams of RCU-led and trained experts with the goal of restoring a lost yet essential balance to AlUla's delicate ecosystems. The return of the Arabian Leopard will be the final piece of a sensitive and complicated puzzle. And there have been successes along the way: RCU's Arabian Leopard Breeding Programme has welcomed the births of four healthy cubs since April 2021, a major milestone and a welcome contribution to the goal of boosting the population in captivity. The naming of a cub born in 2022 as Amal – 'hope' in Arabic – symbolises the rising hopes to protect the future of the species.

RCU's long-term plan outlines a responsible, sustainable, and sensitive approach to urban and economic development that preserves the area's natural and historic heritage while establishing AlUla as a desirable location to live, work, and visit. This encompasses a broad range of initiatives across archaeology, tourism, culture, education, and the arts, reflecting a commitment to meeting the economic diversification, local community empowerment, and heritage preservation priorities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 programme.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/news/cms/2023/02/10/20230210000668.4b335c37-2848-4032-ace3-77b7a973f1cc_T1.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Vinyl craze continues,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3057313,2023.02.08 10:08,"Retro shops offering analog music experience draw younger generation On a recent Tuesday afternoon, a retro cafe in Insa-dong, central Seoul, saw people chilling out on sofas, listening to music from the 1970s and '80s. Each table was equipped with a vinyl record player and a headset for visitors to indulge themselves in music from the likes of British rock band Queen to Korean legend Lee Moon-sae. “It seems like young people nowadays like LPs more than older people do,” said the only middle-aged man in the place, who introduced himself as a 53-year-old vinyl collector surnamed Kang. “They are enjoying old tunes which they are unfamiliar with, while I don’t really listen to songs from these days.” Kang cut a conspicuous figure at Music Complex Seoul, one of a new type of business allowing visitors to enjoy a vast vinyl collection alongside coffee or alcoholic beverages. More than 90 percent of visitors to the vintage coffee place are in their 20s and 30s, the Insa-dong store’s staff said. “Many LP music enthusiasts around me are mostly middle-aged people drawn by nostalgia. Sharing the culture of my generation with younger audiences here makes me feel younger,” he said. Opened in July last year, the LP cafe features a collection of more than 12,000 vinyl record albums. Visitors can listen to them freely during their stay, as long as they order a beverage that costs between 10,000-13,000 won ($8-$10.30). For young music lovers, the old-fashioned, natural sound of vinyl is part of an exploration of a music genre new to them. “I love a little scratchy sound in the background when playing Christmas carols and jazz songs on a record player. Of course, digital music offers clearer and more refined sound but vinyl gives out unique vibes that I can’t feel while listening to a song online,” said Kwon Jae-yeon, a 25-year-old college student in Seoul. He added, “There is a certain pleasure in finding new and unknown music. I get to know about the popular music of my parent's generation. I’d like to come here again with my parents.” Lee Eun-yoo, an avid record collector in her 30s, said she prefers to visit LP cafes or bars even though she has her own turntable at home. “The store’s retro-style interior design and stacks of records add to the vintage mood that I can’t experience at home,” said Lee, who started collecting LPs three years ago. “The whole process of browsing for what to play from stacks of records, taking one out from its paper cover, and playing it on a turntable makes me feel like I own the music I am listening to.” Vinyl records have become a big trend in the music scene here, seeing a substantial increase in sales. According to Yes24, the country’s largest online retailer of books and music albums, vinyl sales shot up 106 percent on-year in 2021. Some local companies have launched special experience zones furnished with vinyl records to appeal to young customers. In October last year, Woori Bank opened a pop-up store called Won Record, at AK＆ Hongdae, a shopping mall complex near Hongik University. Decorated in blue like Woori Bank's logo, the store provides music listening spaces where customers can listen to vinyl records of famous singers, including K-pop singer and actor IU and R＆B singer-songwriter Mariah Carey, free of charge. Visitors can also receive virtual financial counseling about savings and loan services via a kiosk. A special photo booth shaped like an ATM is another popular zone there. Another free music listening zone at a record shop in Itaewon called Vinyl ＆ Plastic, operated by Hyundai Card, attracts many LP collectors for its inventory of nearly 20,000 records for sale. “I can buy LPs online, but I prefer to visit offline shops like here with my friends because I can listen to various kinds of music. I love this quiet and cozy atmosphere here,” said Kong, a 24-year-old college student who visited the store Thursday morning. Space rental providers are also riding on the sustained popularity for LPs, offering rooms furnished with LPs and turntables largely to target youngsters enthused by the retro vibes. A studio apartment called Slow Boat in the Euljiro area in the heart of Seoul is furnished with large square shelves displaying vinyl records, antique furniture and vintage lighting where people can host a small party or spend time alone listening to music. Customers can reserve the space for a minimum of two hours, which costs 50,000 won.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/02/08/20230208000188_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

One day in 2017, he made his first tweet in Korean. At that time, he was into tweeting in various languages to reach out to people from all over the world who were looking at his profile. His tweets are usually simple expressions -- ""I'm bored,"" ""Is this for real?"" -- in ""banmal"" the simplest and most informal form of Korean. But over time his use of the language has become more natural and sophisticated. Last year, a mention of Jungkook of K-pop phenomenon BTS even made entertainment news headlines in Korea. His tweet was, “Stop flirting with me Jungkookie,” written in Korean. More than 90 percent of his recent tweets are now in Korean, which until a few years ago didn’t mean much to him. “When Korean people started looking at me, and I started tweeting their Korean bios, something was different. Koreans really responded to an American tweeting in Korean,” McDonell, 37, said in an interview with The Korea Herald. “I think Korean people’s attention to my Korean tweets has to do with the cultural and political history of Korea and the US -- how for a long time the gaze of the world was to the West, to the US, and how recently, that gaze has been shifting in particular toward Korea,” the actor mused. “I think this is the meaning of Hallyu, or the Korean Wave.” In the beginning, McDonell just copied some words or phrases from tweets written in Korean. As Korean letters seemed like artistic lines and curves to him, rather than recognizable letters of a language, his selection was largely based on how attractive their shapes were. After discovering Korean films and music, his interest in the language deepened and he buckled down to study the language. “I’ve mostly studied Korean on Twitter and at museum exhibitions. And for a while I had a tutor whom I met online while I was living in Texas filming a war movie,” he said. The actor said just two nights prior, he had watched Korean director Park Chan-wook's latest feature film “Decision to Leave.” “It was fantastic. And I’m going to see ‘Broker.’” “Broker” is the first Korean-language film project by Japanese auteur Hirokazu Kore-eda and features a cast of well-known Korean actors, including Song Kang-ho, Bae Doo-na, Gang Dong-won and Lee Ji-eun, better known as singer IU. After five years of tweeting in Korean and some years of language study, McDonell says he now understands daily conversation in Korean and can read plain Hangeul, the Korean alphabet, on Twitter. His favorite Korean word is “sam"" as it carries more than one meaning. “It means three, like the number, and also can refer to hemp, like cannabis – what a lot of people in the US call ‘weed,’” he said, adding that many American learners found this interesting. “I see on the news that there have been a lot of high-profile weed crimes in Korea lately as well.” Aside from the language itself, he has always been intrigued by the history behind Hangeul. “Korean is an elegant, ergonomic language. The most interesting aspect of Hangeul is its efficiency and the story of how it was created,” he said. The writing system was introduced by King Sejong in 1443 to promote literacy among common people. The educated elite at that time were using classic Chinese characters, which reinforced their monopoly on knowledge and learning. “I visited Korea once with my friend. I learned a lot on that trip about the language but especially about the culture. I want to make a film in Korea. I’d love to come back soon,” he said. McDonell's film debut came in 2008's “The Forbidden Kingdom,"" starring Jackie Chan and Jet Li. In 2021, he appeared in an episode of Emmy-winning NBC musical comedy TV series “Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist.”",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/01/25/20230125000462_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Late-night KBS music talk show legacy returns in 'The Seasons-Jay Park's Drive',https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3043805,2023.01.17 18:02,"Cheeky and fresh is how public broadcaster KBS wants to make over its 30-year legacy of late-night music talk shows, with the first new version of “The Seasons,” starting next month. The program will be a one-year project divided into four different seasons, each hosted by different stars. The first season, “The Seasons-Jay Park’s Drive,” will be led by the Korean singer and rapper Jay Park. It is the first time for Jay Park to host a music program for a local broadcast service in his 15-year career as a musician. “I tried to freely engage in the program by asking impromptu questions to our guests so I really enjoyed shooting the first episode. I think this program will be precious for many viewers as they don’t really get the chance to see shows in which musicians get to talk about their pieces in a comfy environment, because these days there are mostly competition and survival music programs,” said Jay Park at a press conference in Seoul on Tuesday. “At first, we thought we were doomed because we took a lot of time writing the script for the first episode of the show, but Jay Park did not go according to the script. But later, we were grateful for having Jay Park hosting the show, because what we wanted to do was just that -- to break the norms. He showed what hosting is in this new generation,” commented producer Lee Chang-suh. The program will focus on introducing music from diverse scenes without prejudice, while shouting out rookie acts. “I want to have IU and NewJeans as guests in our show because they are outstanding musicians offering music that people of all ages can enjoy. In the hip-hop scene, I have this person I would really like to introduce. He is DUT2, an R&B singer born in 2001. His music is sophisticated and he does legit R&B. I want people to get to know him,” Jay Park pointed out. Producers will put effort into conducting in-depth interviews with musicians and creating a well-made stage, according to KBS. That includes forming a young band led by pianist and composer Jeong Dong-hwan of Melomance. “Every member in the band is both fun and talented, apt for doing trendy music. This experience was really valuable for me because I could solely concentrate in playing music,” said the band master. With Jay Park, the program is expected to highlight mostly K-pop and hip-hop musicians. “We have the next two hosts cast for the following seasons. There is the last season left for us to look for a host. We are currently working hard to cast this last person whom we would really like to have as the emcee of our show,” hinted producer Park Seok-hyoung. ""It's a secret."" “The Seasons-Jay Park’s Drive” airs every Sunday at 10:55 p.m. starting Feb. 5.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/01/17/20230117000764_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

As Korean letters seemed like artistic lines and curves to him, rather than recognizable letters of a language, his selection was largely based on how attractive their shapes were. After discovering Korean films and music, his interest in the language deepened and he buckled down to study the language. “I’ve mostly studied Korean on Twitter and at museum exhibitions. And for a while I had a tutor whom I met online while I was living in Texas filming a war movie,” he said. The actor said just two nights prior, he had watched Korean director Park Chan-wook's latest feature film “Decision to Leave.” “It was fantastic. And I’m going to see ‘Broker.’” “Broker” is the first Korean-language film project by Japanese auteur Hirokazu Kore-eda and features a cast of well-known Korean actors, including Song Kang-ho, Bae Doo-na, Gang Dong-won and Lee Ji-eun, better known as singer IU. After five years of tweeting in Korean and some years of language study, McDonell says he now understands daily conversation in Korean and can read plain Hangeul, the Korean alphabet, on Twitter. His favorite Korean word is “sam"" as it carries more than one meaning. “It means three, like the number, and also can refer to hemp, like cannabis – what a lot of people in the US call ‘weed,’” he said, adding that many American learners found this interesting. “I see on the news that there have been a lot of high-profile weed crimes in Korea lately as well.” Aside from the language itself, he has always been intrigued by the history behind Hangeul. “Korean is an elegant, ergonomic language. The most interesting aspect of Hangeul is its efficiency and the story of how it was created,” he said. The writing system was introduced by King Sejong in 1443 to promote literacy among common people. The educated elite at that time were using classic Chinese characters, which reinforced their monopoly on knowledge and learning. “I visited Korea once with my friend. I learned a lot on that trip about the language but especially about the culture. I want to make a film in Korea. I’d love to come back soon,” he said. McDonell's film debut came in 2008's “The Forbidden Kingdom,"" starring Jackie Chan and Jet Li. In 2021, he appeared in an episode of Emmy-winning NBC musical comedy TV series “Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist.”",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/01/08/20230108000153_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Tech4Nature partners announce project to study impact of tourism on biodiversity in Spain,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3036392,2023.01.06 15:10,"Huawei and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) have launched a pioneering project to guide biodiversity conservation focusing on the Bonelli's eagle in Sant Llorenç del Munt i l'Obac Natural Park. BARCELONA, Spain, Jan. 6, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Huawei and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) have selected Sant Llorenç del Munt i l'Obac Natural Park in Barcelona Province for a new Tech4Nature project to study how tourism impacts the park's ecosystem, notably the Bonelli's eagle. The park has seen a clear increase in visitors since the pandemic, reflecting a growing trend of leisure and tourism in periurban natural and protected spaces. As a result, park managers have observed changes in the behavioral patterns of the Bonelli's eagle, which nests in the park and is listed as vulnerable in the Spanish Red Book of Birds. Scheduled for launch in February 2023, the project will see Huawei and partners developing and deploying a tech-based solution comprising cameras, GPS receivers, and a cloud platform that will serve as the computing and storage infrastructure. Forming an alert-detection system, the solution will observe and monitor the mobility of the eagle and determine the factors that disturb its reproductive success – human disturbance to breeding areas has already been identified as a major threat to the eagle. The data collected will be sent to the cloud platform for analysis by AI, which will help guide conservation decisions, support park managers in responding quickly and effectively to potential environmental risks, and educate the public on conservation. ""The project will help us to have more information to manage and regulate public use,"" said Ángel Miño, director of the Natural Park under Barcelona Provincial Council. ""It will also bring biodiversity conservation closer to the general public, as videos and other dissemination materials are planned. In collaboration with Huawei and IUCN, the project allows us to make a qualitative leap by incorporating new technologies to the monitoring and conservation of species."" To boost research and biodiversity protection outcomes, Miño emphasized that expanding public-private partnerships to include universities and the business world is a key facet of the park's management strategy and essential for success, a viewpoint shared by other project's partners. ""Collaboration between public institutions and the private sector is increasingly necessary to determine success in the face of complex environmental challenges,"" said Antonio Troya, Director of the IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation. ""We have the opportunity to take advantage of technological innovations and incorporate them into conservation measures for our ecosystems. This project exemplifies how cooperation and mainstreaming are the way forward to halt biodiversity loss."" Running under the IUCN-Huawei Tech4Nature partnership in line with the IUCN Green List and Huawei's TECH4ALL initiative, the park managers – Barcelona Provincial Council – will launch the project in the park in early 2023. The technical solution will be developed by Huawei in collaboration with the University of Girona during 2023 and 2024. The Tech4Nature partnership, which aims to develop technology-based conservation solutions for 300 protected areas over three years and measure project efficacy against the IUCN Green List, combines IUCN's nature conservation experience and Huawei's expertise in developing cutting-edge digital technologies. ""This project is the first of its kind that we are launching in Spain, after dozens of successful experiences of developing solutions to protect different species and natural spaces in countries around the world using advanced technologies such as cloud, AI, and connectivity,"" said Eric Li, CEO of Huawei Spain. ""The role of the technology industry in meeting this challenge is key, but only through collaboration with strategic and committed partners can the objectives be achieved in a real way."" As well as ensuring that Sant Llorenç del Munt i l'Obac Natural Park can balance biodiversity protection with enjoyment for all, it is hoped that this model can be perfected and replicated in other protected areas of Spain. About Huawei TECH4ALL TECH4ALL is Huawei's long-term digital inclusion initiative that aims to leave no one behind in the digital world. It focuses on four domains: enabling equity and quality of education, conserving nature with technology, enabling inclusive healthcare, and development.

Tsinghua's institute for climate change and Asian Development Bank jointly call for good Nature-based Solutions practices in Asia,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3017837,2022.12.09 20:10,"MONTREAL, Dec. 9, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The UN climate change conference COP27 in Egypt concluded less than three weeks before the kick-off of the 15th UN Biodiversity Conference (CBD COP15) in Montreal. The agendas of the UN treaties on climate change and biodiversity have increasingly intersected. This reflects a growing understanding of the linkages between the two issues and the need for integrated solutions. The Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development at Tsinghua University (ICCSD) and Asia Development Bank (ADB) jointly announced to call for good practices on Nature-based Solutions across Asia at CBD COP15. ""The pathway to carbon neutrality is a systematic revolution related to society as a whole, so carbon neutrality is beyond climate change and Nature-based Solutions (NbS) should go beyond carbon sink only"", said Dr. WANG Binbin, ICCSD's C+NbS head and Executive Secretary General of Global Alliance of Universities on Climate (GAUC) . Defined at the United Nations Environment Assembly in this March, NbS refers to ""Actions to protect, conserve, restore, sustainably use and manage natural or modified terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems, which address social, economic and environmental challenges effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being, ecosystem services and resilience and biodiversity benefits."" Themed Nature ""Innovative Pathway towards the Carbon Neutral Future"", the side-event, co-organized by ICCSD and ADB, is to encourage more explorations on the potential of nature, in particular the sustainable use of nature resources from the climate change perspective. ""As an expert on climate, my reflection is that all renewable energy come from nature resources, so if we agree that renewable energy is the solution towards the net-zero future, then they are Nature-based Solutions from this point of view."" Dr. WANG highlighted, ""We should encourage synergic and integrated perspective."" To tap into nature's strength in addressing climate change, ICCSD has operated the C+NbS platform with more than 400 global partners and carried out a tracing study on global practices since 2019, right after the UN's Climate Action Summit in New York, where China and New Zealand were invited to lead the NbS coalition. The research built a database consisting of 300 global cases and then formulated an evaluation criterion considering the guidance of ecological civilization, UN's Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (SDGs), with reference to the IUCN Global Standard. ""We concluded 6 primary screening indicators and 3 deep evaluation dimensions to select out 28 good cases from the database as the recommended ones to be released during the first phase of the CBD COP15 in Kunming,"" Dr. WANG introduced. ""As the following step, the research scope will be narrowed to the regional level, so as to more accurately find the most cutting-edge and exemplary practical cases."" ICCSD further join hands with ADB to establish an Asian NbS database for deeper analysis of such practices across the region. All organizations who have related practices in Asia could submit their cases to iccsd@tsinghua.edu.cn by March 31 2023. The report of the research is planned to be released at the 28th UN Climate Change Conference in Dubai. The side-event signified the beginning of the strategic partnership between ICCSD and ADB. Representatives from The Nature Conservancy (TNC), World Economic Forum, and ClientEarth, together with GAUC's Global Youth Ambassador, exchange research and practical progress in the field during the plenary. ""We have confidence to explore more innovative solutions for the carbon neutral future with the strong support and network of ADB in Asia,"" said LI Zheng, President of ICCSD. ""Nature is now seen as the key in dealing with acute crises that the Asia and Pacific region is facing, namely, climate change, biodiversity loss, and food insecurity, "" said ZHANG Qingfeng, ADB's Chair of the Environment Thematic Committee.

"More Than 100,000 People Die Annually Across Global Fishing Sector, New Research Shows",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2992111,2022.11.03 13:40,"Illegal fishing, overfishing and climate change contribute to high death rates in one of world's most dangerous professions WASHINGTON, Nov. 3, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- More than 100,000 fishing-related deaths occur each year, a new study finds. Nearly 300 fishers die each day—a much higher estimate than all previous assessments—according to research from the FISH Safety Foundation (FSF) commissioned by The Pew Charitable Trusts. The significant death toll disproportionately affects low-income fishers—including children forced into labor—and is predominantly driven by dangerous working conditions and unsafe vessels. The FSF identified several factors responsible for fisher mortality, including poverty; geopolitical conflict; overfishing; illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing; and climate change. IUU is a significant driver, particularly as the demand for fish protein increases globally. Industrial illegal operators cut corners and ignore safety rules while contributing to the overexploitation of highly profitable catch. This in turn drives what has been identified as ""IUU by necessity,"" in which small-scale, artisanal fishers are driven to break rules or take part in unregulated, dangerous activities as it becomes more difficult to find fish. These conditions are exacerbated by climate change and the changing distribution of fish stocks. ""While fishing can be inherently risky, the harsh reality is that many of these deaths were and are avoidable. With 3 billion people reliant on seafood and the demand expected to rise, stronger policies are urgently needed to keep fishers safe, including ones that address the true drivers of these deaths,"" said Peter Horn, a project director with Pew's international fisheries project, which is focused on ending and preventing illegal fishing. Eric Holliday, chief executive of FSF, said, ""It has been widely speculated that fisher mortality estimates have undercounted and hidden the danger of fishing. Our analysis is the first of its kind and conclusively shows that a lack of transparency in the fishing industry endangers lives by obscuring the full picture of what occurs on vessels or at fishing grounds, making it difficult for governments to set effective policies to improve safety. While we may never be able to pinpoint an exact number of fisher deaths, this should serve as a wake-up call to governments, telling them that in order to save lives, urgent action—informed by better reporting and sharing of mortality data—is needed."" By reviewing publicly available data and by cross-referencing it with investigative journalism and news articles, social media, and private communications with government officials and others, the study authors were able to provide the most complete picture to date of the number of fishing-related fatalities worldwide. But even with all these available tools, data gaps remain, and the total number is nearly impossible to quantify. Insufficient and inaccurate data has made it difficult for decision makers to implement necessary policy changes that ensure the safety of industrial and subsistence fishers at international, state and local levels. Based on the study results, Pew urges action on multiple fronts. Domestically, more needs to be done to implement fisher safety measures and address key drivers. Given the disproportionate levels of fatality in low-income communities, financial support and capacity building are urgently needed. Internationally, improved data collection, transparency and information-sharing efforts will help governing bodies better understand the problems fishers face, more accurately quantify additional risks presented by IUU fishing and adopt policies for stronger vessel safety measures. There are also existing regulatory frameworks available that are designed to stop illegal fishing and protect fishers. Specifically, countries should ratify and implement the Cape Town Agreement, adopted by the International Maritime Organization in 2012, which sets safety standards for the construction and design of fishing vessels; implement the FAO Agreement on Port State Measures, which works to prevent illegally caught fish from entering the seafood supply chain; and continue implementation of the 2007 ILO Work in Fishing Convention C188, which sets standards for living conditions onboard vessels at sea. Member States of regional fishery management organizations should also set clear policies that strengthen efforts to fight IUU fishing and overfishing. ""Fortunately, there are a number of tools available that can help stop industrial IUU and overfishing and improve safety concerns in one of the world's most dangerous professions,"" Horn added. ""While not addressing all the issues, they clearly demonstrate intent to tackle this problem. International authorities must also prioritize counting these deaths. Only with a clearer picture of what is happening on the water can officials know when—and where—stronger action is needed. This study should be a clarion call to international authorities, national governments and fisheries managers around the globe, to be accountable for addressing their piece of the problem. Fishers should no longer be dying in the dark, and governments can no longer ignore the severe human injustices and inequities resulting from insufficient action on IUU fishing, overfishing and climate change.""

The Phase 3 GERD program, known as the TRIUMpH program, includes a large, multi-center, double-blind study evaluating the safety and efficacy of tegoprazan versus a PPI control for the indications of healing of all grades of erosive esophagitis (EE) and the maintenance of EE healing and relief of heartburn. The TRIUMpH program also includes a large, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of tegoprazan in patients with non-erosive reflux disease (NERD). About Tegoprazan Tegoprazan is a novel agent in development for the treatment of acid-related gastrointestinal diseases. It is a member of a class of oral medications known as P-CABs, or potassium-competitive acid blockers, which have been shown to have rapid onset of action and the ability to control gastric pH for longer periods of time than proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Tegoprazan has already received marketing authorization in multiple territories, including South Korea and China. About GERD GERD is a chronic and highly prevalent disorder caused by repeated backflow (or reflux) of gastric contents into the esophagus. GERD is characterized by a wide variety of symptoms, including heartburn and acid regurgitation. The main phenotypic presentations of GERD include non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) and erosive esophagitis (EE). EE is usually clinically differentiated from NERD by the presence of mucosal inflammation and lesions in the distal esophagus. Poorly treated EE can lead to Barrett's esophagus which increases the risk of esophageal cancer. It is estimated that GERD affects approximately 65 million people in the US with 60% to 70% suffering from NERD. While proton pump inhibitors are the mainstay of therapy for both EE and NERD, 35% to 54% of patients fail to achieve complete relief of symptoms. This represents a large unmet and underappreciated patient need.

Huawei and Partners Explore Conserving Nature with Technology at Huawei Connect 2022 Paris,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2982171,2022.10.19 23:41,"PARIS, Oct. 19, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The third stop on the global tour for HUAWEI CONNECT 2022 kicked off in Paris this Monday. Themed ""Unleash Digital"", the major themes explored by industry leaders, experts, and partners from the ICT and green development sectors included unleashing digital productivity, promoting Europe's green and digital transition, and building stronger digital ecosystems. At the event, Huawei hosted an afternoon session and panel discussion exploring the vital role of technology in supporting nature conservation in Europe, during which it introduced the Tech4Nature – Solutions in Focus publication. Developed under the Tech4Nature partnership between IUCN and Huawei, Tech4Nature – Solutions in Focus analyzes the best practices of using technology to achieve effective nature conservation outcomes, with the publication detailing 22 projects in 19 countries. ""There is a clear growing momentum and buy-in from the conservation community to use more technology but also to develop and create new ways it can be applied. The appropriate deployment of technology will help ensure more sustained benefits from its application to achieve fair and effective conservation action,"" said James Hardcastle, Head of IUCN Protected and Conserved Areas. At the session, the NGO Rainforest Connection outlined the various Nature Guardian projects it is running in Europe with Huawei and local partners in ocean, wetland, and forest ecosystems. ""Rainforest Connection uses AI and big data analytics powered by Huawei Cloud to monitor biodiversity and protect ecosystems around the world. By harnessing the power of sound, we are able to track thousands of species globally and automatically detect the presence of illegal activities,"" said Bourhan Yassin, CEO of Rainforest Connection. Examples of projects currently running in Europe using acoustics technologies include monitoring dolphins and whales off the Irish south coast and studying the impact of climate change on bird and amphibian life in Austria's wetlands. Nature Guardian projects in Italy and Greece are focusing on preventing illegal logging, poaching, and other damaging human activities. Also at the session, the Swiss Porini Foundation introduced the pilot project it is running in Switzerland with partners IUCN and Huawei. The project aims to improve accounting on carbon sinks in protected forest areas. The Porini Foundation has developed a forest carbon sequestration application based on cloud computing, blockchain, and high-precision satellite imagery to boost the transparency and traceability of forest carbon sink transactions and ensure the sustainable management and utilization of forest resources. The session concluded with a panel discussion covering how digital technology can enable green transformation in Europe, with TECH4ALL partners, academics, and representatives from industry organizations exploring the technological and strategic roadmap for achieving this aim. Conference attendees could also visit the TECH4ALL exhibition booth onsite to learn more about other TECH4ALL digital inclusion projects running in Europe. These include a world-first project of its type in Norway, which was deployed over 2021 and 2022 to save the nation's endangered wild Atlantic salmon from extinction. The solution uses camera tech coupled with an AI-powered gate system to identify the invasive Pacific salmon – an aggressive resource competitor and prolific spawner – and filter the invader into a holding tank, delivering an outcome that was previously impossible. Under the education domain of TECH4ALL, the France DigiTruck project was also on display, outlining the free training in digital skills offered to empower communities in need, notably unemployed young people and senior citizens.

IUCN and Huawei Launch Tech4Nature Publication to Showcase Best Practices in Technology-based Nature Conservation,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2981090,2022.10.18 22:20,"GLAND, Switzerland, Oct. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and Huawei launched a PANORAMA Tech4Nature – Solutions in Focus publication today, showcasing the role of technology in achieving effective nature conservation outcomes in 22 projects across 19 countries. The cases referenced in the publication were selected from over 50 solutions that address six major conservation challenges. These challenges include the management of protected areas, monitoring species, cultivating community involvement, and financing conservation action. ""There is a clear growing momentum and buy-in from the conservation community to use more technology but also to develop and create new ways it can be applied. The appropriate deployment of technology will help ensure more sustained benefits from its application to achieve fair and effective conservation action,"" said James Hardcastle, Head of IUCN Protected and Conserved Areas. Projects running in Mexico and China are two typical cases included in the publication. In Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, a solution has been deployed to monitor the jaguar population and its prey through a networked system of camera traps and acoustic monitoring, with AI algorithms trained to detect and identify individual jaguars. The data provided will also deliver insights into how climate change is impacting priority ecosystems on the north coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. A key aspect of this project is community involvement in the whole project cycle to boost overall outcomes. In China, a smart fire prevention system designed to protect giant panda habitats has been deployed in various locations, including Tangjiahe national nature reserve, a site that is on the IUCN Green List. In Sichuan's panda habitats, satellite images are analysed in real time to detect possible fires. Risks can be rapidly verified and alerts instantly sent to rangers on the ground. In 2021, the system resulted in a 71% reduction of serious fires. To support the uptake and replicability of technology-based solutions, the publication includes a detailed description of the success factors for each case study. It also provides both a framework of a technological solution architecture and a checklist to help new implementers of technology solutions ensure that deployment is appropriate and able to overcome conservation challenges. The publication also highlights existing gaps in understanding how technology impacts both wildlife and people, and emphasizes the need for transparency, inclusivity, and responsibility when deploying technology-based solutions. ""Digital technology is a key enabler of conserving nature. With more and more deployment of technology and multi-sector collaborations, we believe that the efficiency and effect of nature conservation shall be improved continuously,"" said Catherine Du, Head of Huawei's TECH4ALL program. Launched by IUCN and Huawei, Tech4Nature is developing digital solutions to pilot in five flagship countries: Switzerland, Spain, Mauritius, Mexico and China. The program aims to cover more than 300 protected areas worldwide by 2023 and evaluate conservation success through the IUCN Green List Standard. Aiming to provide guidance on appropriate use of technology in area-based conservation and directly involve the ICT industry in supporting nature conservation outcomes, Tech4Nature – Solutions in Focus comes as the first publication under the IUCN-Huawei partnership. The initiative itself is also the first time that IUCN has embarked on a major partnership with the ICT industry, combining the organisation's extensive standards, knowledge, and experience with the conservation with innovations made possible by technology.

AKMU’s Lee Chan-hyuk to put out solo debut album led by ‘Panorama’,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2975323,2022.10.10 14:01,"Lee Chan-hyuk of K-pop sibling duo AKMU is gearing up to release his first solo album this month. The upcoming album’s lead track will be “Panorama,” YG Entertainment, the duo’s agency, said Monday. With the announcement, the K-pop powerhouse also released a new poster image hinting at the message of the new song. It shows the musician bending his back and gazing upward in a dark tunnel. His first individual album, “Error” is set to drop on Oct. 17. Details on the album including its concept and genre have not yet been unveiled, but Lee’s solo debut itself has piqued fans' interest for his unique musical style. “It will be an album that harmonizes Lee Chan-hyuk's boldness and incomparable original imagination,” YG said in a statement. “This will also be one that fully captures his philosophy in music.” “Error” will become his first solo work since he debuted as half of AKMU in 2014 with the full-length album “Play.” The 26-year-old musician has made himself known for his talent in writing lyrics and arranging music. Lee has taken part in making numerous K-pop songs, including Younha’s “Think About You” (2015), Treasure’s “Slowmotion” (2021), Lee Seung-chul’s “We Were” (2021), IU’s “Ah Puh” (2021), Mudd the Student’s “Dissonance” (2021) and Lee Hyo-ri’s “Free Smile” (2022).

[Herald Review] A promise for 14 more years: IU’s ‘Golden Hour’,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2960344,2022.09.19 14:31,"IU hosts a night of laughter, tears, awe in celebration of 14 years of music The orange sun hung low in the Seoul sky on Sunday evening, and as the clock ticked to 7 p.m., IU’s “Eight” began ringing out at Olympic Stadium in Jamsil, Seoul, marking the start of the second of her two days of “The Golden Hour: Under the Orange Sun” concerts. While all IU concerts are special, “The Golden Hour” was historic in another sense, as it marked her debut at Olympic Stadium, one of the nation’s biggest and most-coveted concert venues. The 30-year-old has done that as the first Korean female soloist. It also marked her first offline gig in three years, since “Love, Poem” in 2019. As the night opened with “Eight,” IU appeared on the stage clad head-to-toe in white. She performed “Celebrity” and danced around the stage, moving to the thrust platform that extended into the floor seats. “It’s full again tonight,” IU said, to which some 40,000 fans erupted in cheers. “It’s a little bit hotter than yesterday, but fortunately, the sky was prettier today. I wanted to sing ‘Eight’ with the sunset. It was something I had planned for a long time,” she said. ""I’m happy that it turned out as pretty as I expected."" IU then kicked into her classics with “dlwlrma,” “Every End of the Day” and “Friday.” During “The Meaning of You,” fans joined in, taking turns with IU. It was a night of celebration as Sunday marked the 14th anniversary of IU’s debut. On Sept. 18, 2008, IU began her career with her first EP, “Lost and Found.” With joys came sorrows, as the night bid a farewell to the much-loved “Palette” and “Good Day.” “I made this song when I was 25 and have sang it until now, cherishing it inside me. But I turned into my 30s (by Korean age), and I want to now leave the song to 25-year-old Jieun,” she said about “Palette,” adding the song will not be included in future official concert set lists. “Good Day” brought IU her first commercial breakout in 2010 and has continued to represent the singer for a long time, and she said she is now putting the song behind her to bring some fresher tunes into the rotation. Plenty of visual surprises, from fireworks to drone shows, were in store. During “Strawberry Moon,” IU appeared on a pink hot-air balloon shaped stage and traveled around the stadium, getting closer to the audience in the upper floors. After IU ramped up the night with, “Blueming,” “Hold My Hand” and “Last Night Story,” the night’s special guest, Jay Park, came to the stage. Along with the dance team Holy Bang, the rapper performed a duet of “Ganadara” with IU. “Although she’s much younger, IU is an artist I truly respect,” he said. “She’s stayed at the top for 14 years, pulling off everything perfectly, from her albums to acting and even the concerts, It’s more amazing for me as, as a fellow musician, I know how much hard work and effort it takes to do that.” IU toned down the mood and removed herself of the glistening glamour in the third part of the night. As she began crooning the lyrics of “Knees,” the hall dimmed. A roar of applause burst from the crowd after the song ended. She continued unrestrained, straight into “Winter Sleep.” “'Knees’ is a song that I think defines myself as a musician, and I wanted to sing the song on this stage even though it’s now so well known. ‘Winter Sleep,’ which followed, is a song that I wrote trying to find that emotions I’d felt when I had written ‘Knees.’ The two are like a set for me,” IU explained, adding it was her first time sharing her thoughts about the two songs. IU went on to softly coo “Night Letter” and “Only I Didn’t Know.” The night took a majestic turn with “Above the Time,” as a drone show began with the backdrop of roaring orchestral sounds. Drones flew up in unison into the night sky and made a silhouette of IU in “Celebrity.” They then moved around to draw an hourglass, the symbolic shape of “The Golden Hour.” Ending the official set list with her ""You & I,” IU was welcomed back to the stage by fans with “Love, Poem.” It was the first song of her encore, but fans gifted her with their own sing-along. “I will stand by your every step as we are perfect friends of 14 years,” read a placard held up by fans. Before wrapping up the night with “My Sea,” IU opened up about the uncertainties she had felt as she waited three years to finally hold the concert. “I really didn’t believe that this moment would come, but it has. I’ve spent the past two months worrying that some issue will come up and it might not happen, so it feels incredible that this moment has finally come,” IU said. It wasn’t just the pandemic that had troubled her. IU said she has been struggling with hearing issues as well. “It’s not something serious, but I haven’t been able to control my ear conditions for around a year now,” she began. “Near the end of yesterday’s show, my ears started to worsen in condition, and from last night until the rehearsal today, the past day has been like hell for me.” “I stepped onto the stage today not knowing what to do, but truly, you guys did everything for today’s show,” she said, thanking fans sincerely. Debuting as a girl at the age of 15, IU has grown into one of the most loved and respected artists over the past 14 years. What has brought her such big love, from listeners young and old, male and female, is not just her musical talents, but the humbleness that she has maintained. IU again moved many hearts with her words. “I thought that this show might be my final destination. I had never imagined being on such a big stage,” she said. “Through tonight’s memory, I will not become arrogant and, staying humble, I will keep on reminding myself about those hearts rooting for me. I’ve only come 14 years, so here’s to another 14 years.”",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/09/19/20220919000525_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

"From 1988 Olympics to MJ’s first concert in Korea, Seoul Sports Complex has many stories to tell",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2939681,2022.08.21 19:41,"Hours before the baseball game between the Doosan Bears and Kiwoom Heroes in Seoul on Thursday, the area around Sports Complex Station was bustling with colorfully dressed fans, merchants and even scalpers calling out to bystanders. The scene was in stark contrast to just a year before, when the Korea Baseball Organization sold only 50, 30, 10 or zero percent of the seats, depending on the COVID-19 pandemic situation at the time. Korean pro sports are back, and the jam-packed exits at the station were there to show it. Mecca of sports, large events in Seoul South Korea’s largest integrated sports center, Seoul Sports Complex is more frequently referred to as Jamsil Sports Complex for its location in the eponymous neighborhood. It was built in 1984 as the country prepared, with wide excitement and anticipation, to host the 1986 Asian Games and 1988 Summer Olympics. The capital playing host to the megasized sports event was hailed as proof of the country’s ascent from the ashes of the Korean War decades before and its rising global profile at that time. Spanning an area of 402,816 square meters, the complex consists of the iconic Olympic Stadium, Jamsil Baseball Stadium, several adjacent buildings and a public park. Serving as a gateway to all these venues is Sports Complex Station on Line Nos. 2 and 9 of the Seoul Metro. Upon getting off the platform, one could immediately tell this is the land of sports: etched across the platforms and waiting rooms of Line No. 2 are pictograms of sporting events. Eight exits are allocated for Line No. 2, while the much-later built Line No. 9 has only one exit leading to the nearby park. The exits leading directly to Seoul Sports Complex are Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8, with No. 5 leading straight to the baseball stadium -- the shared home of the Doosan Bears and LG Twins -- and No. 8 leading to the Student Gymnasium of Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, which is occupied by the SK Knights of the Korea Basketball League. Nos. 6 and 7 lead to the main gate, where one can walk straight to Seoul Jamsil Gymnasium, home of the KBL’s Samsung Thunders, and the behemoth Olympic Stadium itself. Olympic Stadium, as the name indicates, was used as the main venue for the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. It has the largest capacity of any sports arena in the country at just shy of 70,000, or maxing out at 100,000 including standing room. Its relatively antiquated facilities, however, make it unsuitable for many premier or global events currently. While the nearly 40-year-old building may be too old to host pro games, its giant bleachers have made it the perfect spot for concerts or other events of a correspondingly huge scale. This is where Ultra Korea, the local edition of the international electronic dance music-based Ultra Music Festival, is held annually -- this year on Sept. 24-25. As for concerts by a single music act, Jamsil Gymnasium is the more coveted venue. Selling out the gymnasium has been a feat accomplished by only the most popular artists of the time. The first-ever artist to hold a concert there was the great Stevie Wonder in 1995, a feat that was repeated the following year by the “king of pop,” Michael Jackson, who set a record for an artist visiting South Korea by selling about 76,000 tickets for two nights. Since then, a number of international musicians like Roger Waters, Elton John, Metallica, Lady Gaga and Paul McCartney have followed suit, with Coldplay breaking Jackson’s record by selling 100,000 tickets for two shows. H.O.T., popular K-pop boy band from the 1990s, was the first Korean act ever to hold a concert there, and contemporary K-pop stars like EXO, BTS and IU have also occupied the giant stage. Psy held his annual “Summer Swag” concert here earlier in the year, a show famous for showering fans with gallons of water. Seoul Festa 2022 was also held Aug. 10-14 at the main stadium, marked by K-pop performances and the Seoul E-Prix, for the country’s first time hosting the Formula E electric motorsports championship. Of course as in most cases, fame accompanies unwelcomed complications. On Aug. 7, an anonymous online post claiming to be from a “warrior of the Islamic State” warned there would be three bomb attacks at the complex later that day. This caused evacuations of some 1,000 workers preparing for the Seoul Festa, as well as the players, coaching staff and employees of the LG Twins preparing for a game later that day. After an hourslong search by authorities, the temporary shutdown of Sports Complex Station and canceling the Twins’ fan event, the whole thing was revealed to be a “prank” by a mentally challenged man in his 20s. Despite the hiccup caused by the prank or the occasional cancellation of a game such as due to the recent heavy downpours, Seoul Sports Complex is as much of a beloved venue for concerts and events as it is a mecca of Seoul sports. Next month, DJ Alan Walker is slated to hold a concert at Seoul Jamsil Gymnasium on Sept. 14 as part of his ongoing world tour.

IU to hold concerts at Jamsil Olympic Stadium in September,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2923535,2022.07.28 10:32,"K-pop diva IU, the star of Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda's first Korean-language film ""Broker,"" will return as a singer this fall. She will hold ""The Golden Hour"" concerts on Sept. 17 and 18 at the Jamsil Olympic Stadium in southern Seoul, her agency, EDAM Entertainment said Thursday. It marks her first concerts in three years since the ""Love, Poem"" shows held in four South Korean cities and six other Asian countries in 2019. She will be the first female K-pop singer to hold a concert at the stadium, the agency added. With a capacity to house up to 100,000 spectators, including standing seats, the stadium is considered ""a stage of dreams"" for many K-pop artists. Most recently, globally renowned stars such as BTS and Psy had concerts there. (Yonhap)",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/07/28/20220728000290_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Seven-member girl group CSR debuts with EP ‘Sequence: 7272’,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2923339,2022.07.27 18:35,"New K-pop girl group CSR made its debut on Wednesday with its first EP, “Sequence: 7272” under the label Pop Music. The seven-piece act – with members Sua, Geumhee, Sihyeon, Seoyeon, Yuna, Duna and Yeham -- is comprised of 17-year-old girls under the Korean age system. CSR is an abbreviation of “cheotsarang,” the group’s Korean name, which means “first love.” CSR held its debut media showcase in Hannam-dong, Yongsan-gu, central Seoul, Wednesday, a day ahead of the album’s online release at 6 p.m. on Thursday. Kicking off Wednesday’s event, the rookie group also unveiled the music video for “Pop? Pop!,” the title song of the group’s new release, at 2 p.m. “It still has not hit me yet that we have finally made a debut today,” the group’s leader Sua said during the showcase. “I’ve been wishing for this day to come for the last five years as a trainee. It’s so touching, and I’m very glad to show the audience who I really am.” The band aims to evoke fluttering memories of first love. It plans to show various interpretations of first love and tell the story of the members growing up year by year. This year’s theme is “a youth movie on first love,” according to Yeham. The debut EP’s title song “Pop? Pop!” is a pop-dance tune about 17-year-old girls expressing unfamiliar yet delightful feelings of first love. It features funky rhythms and a dynamic bass line with a lyrical melody. The other four tracks in the album are “72.72Hz,” “Manito,” “Toi Et Moi” and “Euratcha!” Members described their debut album with terms such as “blossom bud,” “white drawing paper” and “first page of youth movie,” explaining that the album marks the beginning of the group’s musical career. Yuna, the only Japanese member in the group, compared the first EP to a “rainbow.” She added: “The album includes seven different colors and each of our charms.” CSR members could not hide their excitement at beginning their musical careers. When asked about the group’s concept, Sua said the act has diverse images of “first love,” which range from innocent to cool. Sihyeon added that the group’s most winning attribute is its bright energy onstage. Since Wednesday’s event marks the seven-piece act’s debut, the members also talked about their K-pop role models. Band leader Sua picked BTS because of the boy band’s great teamwork and strong bonds with fans. Among the other big-name artists the members named as role models were Itzy’s Ryujin, Girls’ Generation’s Taeyeon, HyunA and IU. Yuna said she dreamed of becoming a professional K-pop artist like BoA.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/07/27/20220727000670_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

Imagine a World Free of Plastic: Corona Cleans Up Beaches Around the World,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2884641,2022.06.08 20:20,"Corona creates a powerful global visual made from plastic diverted from our oceans LONDON, June 8, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today on World Oceans Day, Corona, an AB InBev global brand, brings its industry-leading net zero plastic footprint* standing to life with an arresting visual installation. The brand unveiled a written letter created from ocean bound plastic with the unifying message, ""Imagine a World Free of Plastic"" to illustrate the global scale of the ongoing environmental crisis. The plastic used in the exhibit is made from materials pulled from global beach clean-ups conducted by Corona and its partners. The installation calls attention to the 300 million tons of plastic that enter our oceans every year and make up over 80% of all marine debris.** (IUCN, 2021). The following markets recreated the Mexico plastic letter with ocean plastic from their local waterways/oceans: Brazil, Chile, Dominican Republic, Germany, Canary Islands, Italy and Puerto Rico. ""World Oceans Day is an opportunity to reflect and understand the human impact on vital natural resources. With Corona's long-standing history of protecting paradise, we needed to send an important message to the world,"" said Felipe Ambra, Global Corona Vice President. ""We created this plastic letter installation to highlight that it's time for action, not just words. We must act urgently to continue to protect our oceans from daily plastic pollution, and we hope this visual inspires others to reevaluate the role and impact they can have."" In addition to the plastic letter, Corona has made significant strides to combat marine plastic pollution in innovative new ways. For Global Recycling Day this year, Corona hosted the first ever Global Fishing Tournament in China, Brazil, Israel, South Africa, Colombia and Mexico that removed nearly 10 tons of plastic debris from the ocean and supported local fishing communities. In Germany, Corona created a clever returnable crate program that utilizes over 90% of recycled plastic to avoid producing virgin plastic. To date, Corona has conducted over 1,400 clean-ups, engaged over 68,000 volunteers, and collected plastic waste from more than 44 million square meters of beach. ""What's important to note is that the plastic we recovered is not local to Mexico. It's plastic that comes from all over the world and ends up on beaches everywhere through ocean currents,"" said Mercedes Guzman, founder of Lamerced, Corona's beach clean up and recycling partner for the Mexico plastic letter. ""Although our work in the field is very difficult, it's fulfilling to send the message that even though it's not my plastic, it's my shared world to protect."" With the plastic beach letter, Corona continues to support its industry-leading position as the first global beverage brand to achieve a net-zero plastic footprint in 2021. This initiative is part of the brand's ongoing efforts to recover more plastic from the environment than it releases.

IUCN and Huawei call for greater technology adoption to protect nature,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2882611,2022.06.07 11:50,"Echoing the ""Only One Earth"" theme of World Environment Day on June 5, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Huawei, and global partners explored the role of technology in nature conservation at the Tech for a Better Planet summit. SHENZHEN, China, June 7, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Huawei, and conservation project partners came together today to call for an increased global drive to develop and deploy new technologies to better protect the Earth. The two partners hosted the ""Tech for a Better Planet"" online summit to demonstrate how technology can vastly improve nature conservation outcomes, unveiling new digital technologies that are set to become crucial enablers of environmental protection. The process of responding to environmental threats has increased awareness that technology can make a pivotal difference in nature conservation. ""We believe that digital technology is a key enabler of environmental protection,"" said Tao Jingwen, Director of the Board and Director of the Corporate Sustainable Development Committee for Huawei. ""All sectors of society should work together within an open and collaborative market environment to apply technological innovations to industries and transform new technologies into solutions and services that can help build a green planet."" Huawei promotes green development in industries through ICT innovations that support the global zero-carbon journey. On the energy supply side, the company has integrated power electronics and digital technologies to accelerate the development of renewable energy. In terms of energy use, Huawei will continue to innovate energy-saving technologies to continuously improve the energy efficiency of ICT infrastructure, in turn saving energy and reducing emissions in industries. Huawei has also formed long-term partnerships to improve nature conservation outcomes by developing technology solutions that can better understand nature and result in more effective measures for protecting biodiversity in a range of ecosystems. In 2020, IUCN and Huawei launched the global Tech4Nature project and have since initiated pilot projects based on IUCN Green List Standard in Switzerland, Spain, China, Mexico, and Mauritius. Off the coast of Mauritius, IUCN, Huawei, and Ecomode Society deployed the first underwater system in the Western Indian Ocean that can monitor coral reef ecosystems in real time. The aim of the project is to restore highly threatened coral reef ecosystems by growing live coral in nurseries, transplanting them, and monitoring growth, water conditions, and threats like algae. The solution comprises underwater cameras with special lenses, sensors, a 4G network to carry data, and AI to interpret the findings. To date, nearly 10,000 coral fragments have been transplanted to degraded reefs, with a total of 25,000 planned for the end of 2022. ""The IUCN-Huawei partnership Tech4Nature project is a good example of an innovative project between the conservation and ICT sectors to realize the transformative potential of the appropriate use of digital technology for area-based nature conservation impact."" said Stewart Maginnis, Deputy Director General - Programme, IUCN. IUCN positions the combination of ""Technology, Data, and Innovation"" as central to achieving the ambitious goals of the IUCN Nature 2030 Programme. The organization also believes that innovations in data sensing, big data, machine learning, and AI can significantly improve knowledge and insights into impact areas such as land, water, oceans, and climate. In turn, this will help stakeholders design better informed conservation actions and monitoring systems for species and ecosystems. Also at the summit, experts and conservationists from the environmental and science sectors, including Ecomode Society, WWF Italy, Berlevåg jeger og fiskeforening, Shan Shui Nature Conservation Center, and Huawei Digital Energy Product Line, shared their insights and global practices on climate change and the conservation of natural resources.

‘Broker’ director Kore-eda aims to break prejudice against mothers who give up kids,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2881960,2022.06.06 15:05,"Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda’s new film “Broker” does not hide the key question that the director wants to ask the audience: Should mothers take all the blame for abandoning their children in “baby boxes”? “At the beginning of the movie, Soo-jin (played by Bae Doo-na) says ‘if you are going to abandon a newborn, you should not have given a birth to him.’ This shows that there is a kind of prejudice toward mothers. The film starts from there,” the director said during an interview with a group of local reporters at a cafe in Samcheong-dong, central Seoul. “The film shows how much Soo-jin’s prejudice changed.” Kore-eda said he found out about the prejudice while talking with a man who grew up in an orphanage that had harbored some resentment toward his mother. “He said he had contemplated the question: Did my mom want me to be born?” Kore-eda said. It was at that moment that it occurred to Kore-eda that the blame should not be solely on mothers, and that society should also share the responsibility. Kore-eda’s “Broker” centers on relationships formed through baby boxes installed at churches or institutions in Korea where desperate parents can leave their newborns anonymously. The fictional story begins with So-young (IU) leaving her baby in a box in front of a church. Sang-hyun (Song Kang-ho) and Dong-soo (Kang Dong-won) secretly steal the baby to sell him to a family who cannot legally adopt. So-young, who returns to the church the next day to retrieve the baby, finds out that Sang-hyun and Dong-soo have taken her child. Soon, So-young and the two men are looking for the right parents for the baby. Meanwhile, police officer Soo-jin is investigating the two men. The 60-year-old director said he heard negative feedback on some lines that were deemed “too direct” in conveying another underlying theme of cherishing life, such as a scene when So-young says, “Thank you for coming into this world,” to everyone in the room. But this was intentional, he emphasized. “I also strongly believed that my film should look at every human’s life positively,” he said. During the interview, the Japanese director also revealed how he created the framework of the new film. “I created this film with three boxes,” Kore-eda said. “The first box is the smallest one that the baby is being abandoned in, and then the second box is the van that brokers in the film travel in with the baby. The last box is symbolic and invisible -- the society that surrounds the baby.” Since Kore-eda cannot speak Korean, he noted that he got some help from veteran actor Song. Kore-eda highlighted that there was a particular moment when the star impressed him the most during this process. “Song Kang-ho suggested cutting out some of the lines that his character says. I tried cutting it out accordingly and it was indeed a whole lot better. But it is really rare for an actor to ask the director to cut out his own lines. In fact, it was the first time,” he said. “That was when I realized that Song Kang-ho is the actor that truly cares about creating a better film.” Kore-eda also shared his recent participation in the 75th Cannes Film Festival at which Song won the best actor award for his role in “Broker.” “It is the eighth time that I was invited to Cannes and every time it is different,” he said. “The most evident difference that I have noticed this time was that there were billboards for ‘Broker’ everywhere, which made me realize the power of CJ ENM. I was proud, but at the same time it was a lot of pressure seeing the poster of my work hung at the hotel I am staying at. I did take photos with it though,” Kore-eda said jokingly. When asked to talk about the decline of the Japanese film industry in the global standing, Kore-eda carefully said that he did not want to compare the current situation with the heyday of the Japanese film industry. “It is the same with the Italian and French film industries, there can be ups and downs, so I do not take it as a negative phenomenon,” Kore-eda said. “But it is true that the Japanese film industry is stagnant when looking at it from an outsider’s perspective. I know that there are a lot of talented actors and creators who are willing to do something fun. I think it is the old production environment that is making them difficult to take on challenges. There is not enough capital to develop something new so original works are rare. There are things that I learned while working in Korea and France. I learned what we have to work on, so I want to go back to Japan and make some improvements.” Kore-eda worked with French actors and staff for his previous project, “The Truth.” “Broker” hits local theaters Wednesday.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/06/06/20220606000115_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Director Kore-eda says Song Kang-ho inspired him to make ’Broker‘,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2879345,2022.06.01 15:10,"Actor Song Kang-ho recalled what it was like to receive the best actor award at the 75th Cannes Film Festival, a first for a Korean male, during a press conference for the film held Tuesday, just a day after returning from France. “Very few get to receive awards at Cannes. Only seven out of 21 movies (in competition) get awards. Before midnight, those seven films get a notice that they will receive awards. So I was really nervous before midnight,” Song said during the press conference held at CGV Yongsan in central Seoul. “It is hard to recall the exact moment when my name was announced. I think I panicked and had a bizarre feeling and also was very happy.” Song added that the first text messages he received after getting the award were from director Bong Joon-ho in London and director Kim Ji-hoon in Korea. “They were watching the awards ceremony on YouTube. I received so many congratulatory messages and so much praise. I want to continue to enjoy them bit by bit,” Song joked. Director Hirokazu Kore-eda also shared what it was like to watch Song receive the top actor prize. “I am a little cynical, so when people praise my work I think about which part was good and can never enjoy their praise. But when my actors receive praise, I can truly enjoy it and be happy,” the director said. “Japanese reporters also told me that I looked happier than usual.” The Japanese director added to the praises for Song’s performance. “I think Song won the award not because I did something right; it was due to the accumulation of all the work that he has done. I could not believe that he had not received any awards previously,” he said. “If he had received the award earlier for appearing in director Bong Joon-ho’s work or director Lee Chang-dong’s work, nobody would have thought that he did not deserve it. I feel sorry that he is receiving it (belatedly) with my project, and I am so happy. It is the best award that my movie ‘Broker’ can receive.” Kore-eda’s “Broker” centers on relationships formed through “baby boxes” installed at churches or institutions in Korea where desperate parents can leave their newborns anonymously. The film begins with So-young (played by IU) leaving her baby in front of a baby box at a church. Sang-hyun (played by Song) and Dong-soo (played by Kang Dong-won) secretly steal the baby to sell him to a family who cannot adopt legally. So-young who returns to the church the next day finds out that Sang-hyun and Dong-soo have taken her baby. Soon, So-young and the two men are looking for the rights parents for the baby. Meanwhile, a cop, Soo-jin (Bae Doo-na), follows the two men and nabs them as they are about to make an illegal deal with potential parents. During the conference, the Japanese director talked about what it was like to work with Korean actors. “I am sure actors had concerns since I do not speak Korean. In order to solve that problem, I tried communicating with them as much as possible. Before shooting the film, I gave them a hand-written letter. Once we started filming, we tried having a deep conversation. Also, Song Kang-ho gave me feedback after watching the roughly edited version each day,” the director said. The director also went on and talked about how Song inspired him to make the movie. “A scene of Song Kang-ho gently talking to a baby in the baby box and also selling babies came to my mind. I thought about Song playing a character that has both good and evil sides and that’s where I started from,” he said. He discovered about baby boxes while working on other projects. “When I was filming ‘Like Father, Like Son’ in Japan, I did a lot of different research about adoption and found out that there is a baby box in Kumamoto. Then I found out that there are baby boxes in Korea as well. According to statistics, the number of babies that are placed in baby boxes in Korea is over 10 times greater than the number in Japan.” He said. Korean heartthrob Kang talked in greater detail about his character and how he prepared for it during the press conference. “Dong-soo is from an orphanage and is also a partner of Sang-hyun who steals babies for adoption. Before filming the scenes, I had a conversation with people who used to live in orphanages. The most impressive thing for me was when they told me about how the children would get their hopes up when they heard a car come in, thinking that someone might be there to take them home. I thought that my character Dong-soo also waited for his mother like them,” he said. “Dong-soo is also a man who believes that children should grow up in a family and not at an orphanage. He also probably had some resentment (toward his mom). And realizes through So-young that his mother could have had reasons for not coming back to get him.” The singer-turned-actor IU, also known as Lee Ji-eun, talked about a difficult scene that she had to perform. “Since the director is Japanese, the script had swear words that did not seem natural for Koreans. So I asked if I could add some Korean swear words and the director allowed me to change it freely,” she said.” This is the first time I‘ve performed lines with swear words. So I practiced them a lot at home and was very nervous before filming.” “I always thought that Lee Ji-eun was a great actor but I did not know that she would pull off the scene so well,” Song said. “Another scene that I really liked was when they (Sang-hyun and Dong-soo) hop onto a van after failing to find the right parents. Sang-hyun and Dong-so do not know what to do in that scene and speak gibberish, and, just at that moment, she (IU) kicks the front seat. That was not in the script so I was really surprised and could perform a realistic reaction,” Song said.

K-pop pioneer Seo Taiji’s 30 years remembered in 30 hits,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2875923,2022.05.31 16:25,"Referred to as the “culture president” of South Korean music, Seo Taiji is a living legend of K-pop who has paved the path in which the modern Korean music industry was built upon. Born Jeong Hyun-cheol in 1972, Seo kicked off his music career as part of a heavy metal band named Sinawe at the age of 17. In 1992 he formed Seo Taiji and Boys with members Yang Hyun-seok and Lee Juno and made his official debut with single “I Know” on March 23. The trio instantly shot to fame, introducing Western pop and hip-hop genres into mainstream sounds and rewrote the history of Korean pop music. With a slew of bold hits under its belt, the band came to set the standards of what we know as K-pop music, especially idol music, and also brought about social changes with songs that challenged the norms and appealed to the youths of 1990s. The band abruptly disbanded in 1996. Seo returned as a solo act after a two-year hiatus. Barely appearing in public and unveiling himself only with bursts of new music that continued to extend influence on listeners. Dropping his last album “Quiet Night” in 2014, Seo has been on an indefinite hiatus since. In commemoration of Seo's 30th anniversary, here are 30 of Seo’s most career-defining hits as a belated celebration and a brief look back on the roots of the K-pop music that we listen to. 1. “Nan Arayo (I Know)” While this debut song of band Seo Taiji and Boys received the lowest score of the night for its performance on a TV talent show in 1992, that didn’t stop it from taking the nation by storm with its eclectic sound fusing elements of hip-hop, Western pop and dance music. 2. “You in the Fantasy” The success of “I Know” was soon followed by “You in the Fantasy,” another single from the band’s first debut LP. Consisting of only rap verses, a format never-before-seen in the local music scene until then, this rowdy techno- and synth-infused dance tune questions one’s preconceived reality. 3. “Hayeoga (Anyhow Song)” “Hayeoga” deviates in sound from the debut single, combining elements of heavy metal with traditional gukak sounds through the use of “taepyeongso,” a Korean wind instrument. The second LP, on which the song was listed, became the first record in Korea to sell over 2 million copies. 4. “Our Own Memories” Marked as the first so-called “fan song” by a musician in the K-pop history, this song, composed and penned by Seo, is a letter for the fans, sincerely delivering his gratitude and love to the fans and promising an eternity with them. While Seo Taiji and Boys disbanded later, this song has kept many fans with Seo throughout the many ups and down in his career. 5. “Swamp of Death” Perhaps not the most loved among Seo’s discography, this pop-rock track directly touches upon the issue of drug use, a topic not commonly dealt with music. The lyrics tell the story of a drug addict, and the simple beats over which the vocals growl low is reminiscent of Michael Jackson’s “Dangerous,” which is not surprising, as Seo is an avid fan of Jackson and whom he was heavily influenced by. 6. “To You” Another song written by Seo in devotion to his fans, this score consists of gentle vocals, soft raps and flowing narration, hitting the ears like a sweet whisper. Seo Taiji dropped a new metal remake of the song in 2000, which was included on the sixth album “Tai Ji.” The song regained prominence in 2013 with the popular TV series ”Reply 1994“ in which balladeer Sung Si-kyung’s remake of the song was used. 7. “Dreaming of Balhae” This alternative rock track voices the hope of unification of Korea. Ringing out the importance of peace on the Korean Peninsula, the song was later included in high school textbooks and, in April 2018, was played during the inter-Korean summit as the leaders of two Koreas closed their meeting. 8. “Kyoshil Idea (Classroom Ideology)” This metal-infused rock score from the third LP went up front with condemning the stressful Korean education system for suffocating students mentally and creatively by pressuring them to succeed academically. While the song received a sensational support from youths, it was banned from being played on air for its lyrics censuring the education system. The band was accused of backmasking Satanic messages in the song, which was later proved groundless. 9. “Come Back Home” The trio forayed into gangsta rap with this title song of their fourth LP. The lyrics rail against the societal pressures on teenagers that pushed them to run away from home, with the chorus reflecting their parents’ perspectives. Working as a mediator between the youths and their parents, it had a ripple effect on the society and brought back many youngsters home. BTS released a remake of the song in 2017 as part of Seo’s 25th anniversary project ”Time: Traveler.“ 10. “Pilseung (Must Triumph)” An alternative rock score from the fourth LP, the song marked the band’s return to the bold, classic rock sound. ”I felt rejuvenated,“ Seo had said about the album in a later interview. 11. “Good Bye” Never did the fans know when this was listed on the fourth LP, that it was a farewell note from Seo. The song was only instrumental in the fourth LP, with the version with the vocals later released on their 1996 compilation, entitled “Goodbye Best Album.” Seo sang the song live for the first time during his 25th anniversary concert, and said, ”This was a song that expressed how I felt back then, and I dared not sing it to you until now.“ 12. “Sidae Yugam (Shame of the Times)”The song was blocked by censors who screened the song ahead of release and forbade the act from including lyrics critical of the government. Refusing to rewrite the lyrics, he removed the vocals and dropped an instrumental version. Enraged fans protested against the screening system, playing a significant role in the abolishment of the system in 1996. 13. “Take Two”Seo resumed his music career in 1998 with the fifth LP ”Seo Tai Ji,“ a mostly heavy metal-coated album with some of the tracks titled just by number, including this alternative rock number. The lyrics are about the conflict between the new and old, criticizing the communication breakdown between the older generation and the youths. 14. “Take Five” One of the most renowned tracks from his first solo album, ”Take Five“ is considered to take on a brighter disposition with flashes of late- ‘90s college rock. The lyrics send the message to fans that Seo is returning to music after discovering the good people around him and the good inside himself. 15. “Tank” The public recognition for soloist Seo Taiji exploded with the 2000 sixth LP, with which he fully embraced his heavy metal side with hits, including this track. The lyrics lash out at the system that oppresses his values and creativity, and was later given the spotlight in 2002 in relation to the Yangju highway incident, in which two school girls were struck and killed by a US armored vehicle. 16. “Orange” A nu metal track which brings light upon the heavy guitar riffs and Seo’s cynical raps which were received well by the local music critics. The title, ”Orange,“ is suggestive of the song’s message, which criticizes snobs and hypocrites who put on a false mask or who goes against his stated virtues, just like an orange which looks different from the inside and out. 17. “Internet War” The song sends a warning against the harmful side-effects of the internet and the dangerous behaviors spreading in the cyberspace -- a timely message when internet technology was on the rise. The song is better known among the younger K-pop listeners after boy band SHINee’s Jonghyun and Taemin performed it in 2012. 18. “Daegyeongseong (Feel The Soul)” The song was originally released as a track of Seo’s sixth LP under the title ”Daegyeongseong,“ in which Gyeongseong refers to the name of Seoul during the Japanese colonial rule in the early- until mid-’90s. It was later remastered in 2001 as a Japanese single, with the titled renamed in English as ”Feel the Soul.“ 19. “Ultramania” The song was created by Seo in devotion to his fans and the people of all extreme tastes and passion -- who are referred to by the word ”mania.“ Seo called them those who actually bring about meaningful changes in the world. The sound, a mixing of hardcore rock with heavy metal, peppered with Seo’s raps, was also acclaimed by fans of music. 20. “Heffy End” Just as the other songs of the seventh LP, which tend to expound on the emotional aspects, this song in essence is a sad love song which shows the obsessiveness of a woman who confines her lover. Seo shows the deviated love by intentionally misspelling it as ”Heffy“ instead of ”Happy.“ 21. “Robot” This lead track of his seventh LP, ”7th Issue“ is about Seo’s own youth, portrayed through a boy who is gradually destroyed by the cruelty that exists in the overly digitalized society. It draws on the feelings of losing his emotions and becoming empty with age, the anguish that he had felt growing older. 22. “Live Wire” A hit lead single of the seventh album, ”Live Wire“ continues the vivacious energy of ”Ultramania.“ Seo goes onto add drum and bass sounds into several of his songs in the seventh LP, including this one, cranking up the rock sound and making it catchy. The song sings of celebrating musical freedom and his steadfast devotion to music. 23. “F.M Business” The song is the most similar in its nu metal sound with the songs of his sixth LP, unlike the other tracks of ”7th Issue“ with which Seo made some new attempts. The song lampoons the commercialized music business and the artist exploitation from record labels, and his frustration at having to return to such an industry. ”F.M Business“ stands for ”F----- up Music Business.“ 24. “October 4th” This track represents a shift in his usual heavy metal style, lightly driven by two guitars, which later makes a dramatic transition into a full ensemble with heavy percussion and a bass guitar. The lyrics tell the story of a man whose mind is flooded with memories of a lost love, which Seo later revealed was inspired from his very first love in middle school. Written in numbers, ”October 4th“ is ”1004,“ which also means ”angel“ in Korean. 25. “0 (Zero)” The longest track on the album, ”0“ is one of Seo’s uncontested masterpieces. Compared to the heavy, pensive lyrics about being ”reduced to zero“ after a long, hopeless life, this symphonic rock piece boasts a beautiful rock sound born from Seo’s mastery in music making. 26. “Moai” Following a long hiatus, Seo returned in 2008 with “Moai,” the first of his ambitious three-part mystery series. Seo introduced a new experimental style that he created and coined it ”nature pound” with this track, which draws inspiration from the mysterious statues of Easter Island, which had long fascinated him, and the music video was partially shot on the island. 27. “Bermuda (Triangle)” The second single from the eighth LP, the lyrics metaphorically deal with opening one’s eyes to sex, comparing the experience to getting lost in the Bermuda Triangle, and learning to become an adult by finding one’s way out of the mysterious region. Seo later married actor Lee Eun-sung who appears in the song’s music video. 28. “Morning Snow” The song rings out a calm ethereal vibe that stands out among the dark, mysterious sounds of the eighth album. It expresses his gratitude for fans and the innocent love they share, just like the pristine untouched snow of the early morning. Some say the song may have been a farewell to the fans as the lyrics sing of cherishing this moment that will soon turn into the past, which he will remember forever. 29. “Sogyeokdong” Fronting his ninth LP “Quiet Night,” “Sogyeokdong” was released in October 2014. Taking the name of his hometown in Jongno-gu, Seoul, “Sogyeokdong” came in two versions -- the first release featuring the voice of singer-songwriter IU over Seo’s composition, and the second one with Seo’s solo vocals. 30. “Christmalo.win” Seo continues his takedown of societal norms through his music in this synth-rock tune, which Seo said was inspired by his daughter. The name is a compound word of Christmas and Halloween, and the song, as well as the accompanying Tim Burton-like music video, depicts two towns with the stereotypical roles twisted into Santa Claus and Halloween monsters.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/05/31/20220531000611_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
"CJ ENM anticipated to hit jackpot with ‘Decision to Leave,’ ‘Broker’: experts",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2877996,2022.05.30 16:06,"CJ ENM is likely to hit the box office jackpot as an investment distributor of two films -- “Decision to Leave” and “Broker” -- which won major titles at the 75th Cannes Film Festival, film critics said. Park Chan-wook won best director for “Decision to Leave” and Song Kang-ho won best actor for “Broker” at Cannes on Saturday. Some local film critics predicted that CJ ENM could sell as many tickets as it did pre-pandemic in 2019 with the two films. “Since I have not seen the film yet it is hard to predict, but ‘Broker’ has Song Kang-ho and many strong points as a commercial film so I expect to be successful (at the box office),” film critic Jung Ji-wook said. Culture critic Ha Jae-keun was a bit more cautious but believed the films would have a good start. “The recent trend has been that just because films won some awards at a big film festival, does not automatically mean the films can attract moviegoers. I think success will depend on actual moviegoers’ reviews,” Ha said. “But since the two films got a lot of attention from the media, it will help attract audiences in the beginning.” CJ ENM will release “Broker“ on June 8 and release “Decision to Leave” three weeks later, on June 29. So far, three films in which CJ ENM has invested and holds distributions rights to have won at the Cannes Film Festival, including Bong Joon-ho’s “Parasite,” which won the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 2019. “Parasite,” which was released after winning the Palme d’Or, sold 10.31 million tickets. Sales at CJ ENM’s film business increased by 63.8 percent to 349.3 billion won ($281.65 million) and its operating profit reached 43.6 billion won. Meanwhile, the two films -- “Decision to Leave” and “Broker” -- have been performing well in the global film market. “Decision to Leave” has been sold to 192 countries, which is close to the record held by “Parasite,” which was sold to 205 countries. “Broker” has been sold to 171 countries. Park’s new movie centers on a polite and honest police officer named Hye-jun (Park Hye-il). Hye-jun looks into a suspicious death that occurred on a mountain and comes to suspect the dead man’s wife, the mysterious Seo-rae (Tang Wei). At the same time, Hye-jun becomes attracted to her. “Broker” features a cast of famous Korean actors, including Song, Bae Doo-na, Gang Dong-won and IU, and centers around the relationships formed through a “baby box,” a box installed at churches or institutions where desperate parents can leave their newborns anonymously.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/05/30/20220530000604_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
"Park Chan-wook wins best director, Song Kang-ho, best actor at Cannes",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2877701,2022.05.29 14:21,"One of the world’s most prestigious film festivals has once again acknowledged the power of South Korean cinema. South Korea took home two major titles -- Park Chan-wook won best director for “Decision to Leave” and Song Kang-ho won best actor for “Broker” – at the 75th Cannes Film Festival that ended Saturday. Park’s thriller-romance film, “Decision to Leave,” about a detective who comes across a widow who is a prime suspect in his murder investigation, stars Korean actor Park Hae-il and Chinese actor Tang Wei. In accepting his award, Park expressed gratitude to fans for going to theaters and looked forward to a bright future for cinema. “With the dreadful pandemic, there were times when we struggled due to the theaters closing down, but at the same time, we all realized how precious the existence of theaters had been to us. I am confident that we will keep safeguarding the cinemas in difficult times, like we have been through the pandemic,” Park said in Korean. This marks Park’s third win at Cannes. He won the Grand Prix in 2003 for the thriller “Oldboy” and the Jury Prize in 2009 for the horror film “Thirst.” Although “The Handmaiden” failed to win at Cannes in 2016, it went on to win the best film not in the English language at the British Academy Film Awards in 2018. No stranger to Cannes -- this was his seventh visit -- Song won his first-ever Cannes prize for playing an illegal baby broker in Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda’s heartwarming tale about a Korean family seeking home for an abandoned baby found in a “baby box.” The film is Kore-eda’s first all-Korean cast, all Korean-language film and also stars Gang Dong-won, Lee Ji-eun, also known as singer IU, and Bae Doo-na who starred in Kore-eda’s 2009 film, “Air Doll.” Meeting with reporters later, Park explained how his film differs from others in similar genres and with similar plots. “The first part ends and the second part unfolds in a new direction,” Park said. The woman who was pictured as a mysterious femme-fatale is no longer a subject of male gaze, but telling her own story, moves to the center of the story, Park explained. Song paid tribute to Kore-eda for his understanding of Korean culture, which made Song and other Korean actors comfortable throughout the shoot. “I have seen almost all of Kore-eda’s films so far. Not just myself, but many Korean fans love his films for the distinctive aesthetics of Japanese movies,” Song told reporters. The nine-member jury led by French actor Vincent Lindon gave the Palme d’Or to Swedish director Ruben Ostlund’s class warfare comedy “Triangle of Sadness.” This is the director’s second win of the top honor prize after “The Square” in 2017. Actor Zar Amir Ebrahimi was named best actress for her role as a journalist in Ali Abbasi’s “Holy Spider.” The jury prize went to “Le Otto Montagne” directed by Charlotte Vandermeersch and Felix van Groeningen, and “Eo” by Jerzy Skolimowski.

Tech for a Better Planet: Can Technology Protect Our Home?,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2877119,2022.05.28 01:51,"SHENZHEN, China, May 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- On June 6, Huawei is hosting the 2022 Tech for a Better Planet summit with support from IUCN(International Union for Conservation of Nature). With greenhouse gases choking the earth and up to 1 million of plant and animal species threatened with extinction, World Environment Day 2022 comes at a time when our planet is facing unprecedented challenges. The world's growing population requires more power than ever before, with average energy consumption jumping by 1% to 2% every year. And increasing technology adoption is a contributing factor to humanity's growing carbon footprint. For example, in 2020, smartphones accounted for 1% of global carbon emissions, but this is forecast to rise to 3.5% within a decade. Equally, traffic on telecom networks is predicted to increase fivefold from 2018 to 2024, with each person in the world expected to generate the data equivalent of 6,700 photo uploads per day. So, is technology helping or hurting the planet? Can we turn the tide against the environmental threats using technology? A key step moving forward is to prioritize energy-efficiency and green development in the technology sector and to pass on the innovations we make to other industries. From green communications networks to green data centers, green innovations can make a pivotal difference to the global carbon footprint created by business. By adopting digital technologies, we predict that industries can reduce their energy consumption by 20% by 2030, a carbon offset that will be ten times greater than the energy used by the ICT sector itself. However, increased energy consumption is not the only threat our planet faces. The ability of the world's rainforests to remove carbon from the atmosphere is declining as rapidly as forest cover is disappearing, reducing carbon sinks and creating a domino effect on habitat and biodiversity loss. For nature conservation, we must develop solutions that can understand the world's ecosystems and form the basis of effective protective measures. With our partners, including the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and Rainforest Connection, we have been developing solutions under our Tech4Nature and TECH4ALL initiatives to make this possible in ecosystems around the world, from rainforests, mountains, and plateaus to wetlands, rivers, and oceans. Infrared camera technology analyzed by cloud AI, for example, is helping to track and monitor species that are close to extinction, including the Darwin's fox and Hainan gibbon. Similar technologies are enabling the restoration of a coral reef system in the Indian Ocean and working to prevent an invasive species from decimating wild Atlantic salmon populations in Europe. AI-powered acoustics solutions deployed in tree canopies can detect the sounds of chainsaws and trucks associated with illegal logging in rainforests and send real-time alerts to rangers in the field. According to the UN, up to 90% of logging is illegal and, since pre-industrial times, 64% of all rainforest has been destroyed or degraded. Collaborate for conservation While technology underpins nature conservation and the net zero journey, partnerships deliver the results.

"Kore-eda says if 'Broker' is not fun, this would be his responsibility",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2877037,2022.05.27 10:45,"CANNES, France -- Japanese auteur Hirokazu Kore-eda has said that he will take full responsibility for any criticism for his Cannes-competing drama ""Broker"" made with Korean creative minds. ""Korea's star actors and renowned crew members participated in this project,"" the Japanese director told Korean reporters on Wednesday (local time) on the sidelines of the ongoing 75th Cannes Film Festival in Cannes. ""If the film isn't fun, it's all my fault."" ""Broker,"" written and directed by Kore-eda, depicts the relationships of characters formed through a baby box, where people anonymously drop off newborns that they can't raise. It is the Japanese director's first Korean-language project and is produced and distributed by Korean firms, including CJ ENM, a leading entertainment firm in the country. ""Parasite"" star Song Kang-ho plays the lead role in the drama, along with star actors Kang Dong-won and Bae Doo-na and singer-and-actress Lee Ji-eun, also known as IU. Crew members behind ""Parasite,"" including director of photography Hong Kyung-pyo and composer Jung Jae-il, also teamed up with Kore-eda, who visited the Cannes festival for the eighth time with ""Broker"" following ""Shoplifters,"" the winner of the Palme d'Or in 2018. ""I can say that the movie has an excellent ensemble cast of five lead actors and two children actors. Their performance changes further in an interesting way,"" he said. ""I hope you enjoy their on-screen chemistry."" He noted that ""Broker"" is different from typical and familiar stories about family bound by blood or necessity featured in his critically acclaimed works, like ""Still Walking"" (2008), ""Like Father, Like Son"" (2013) and ""Shoplifters."" ""While doing some research and writing the script, I thought this movie is about life,"" he said. ""It tells a story of a life who gets involved with well- and ill-intentioned people and goes on a trip to Seoul from Busan."" Meanwhile, ""Broker"" drew mixed media reviews after the film's official screening as one of the in-competition pieces at Cannes on Thursday. British daily Guardian gave two stars out of five, saying that Kore-eda's new film is ""fundamentally silly, with tiringly shallow characterization."" It pointed out that the film depicts the broker (Song) or kidnapper, who steals a newborn for himself and offers it for sale on the adoption black market, as a ""lovable rogue."" The Telegraph also gave two stars in a review, saying ""this may be the Cannes competition's biggest disappointment."" On the other hand, US media Deadline said ""Broker"" has some ""slackness"" in the storytelling, but its warm and humorous tone works well throughout the story. ""Esteemed Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda walks a fine line between keen social observation and overt sentimental emotionalism in Cannes competition title 'Broker,'"" it said. Variety, a US entertainment magazine, praised the film for its warm and nonjudgmental look at baby boxes and their back stories, adding ""audiences unexpectedly come to empathize with practically everyone involved in the buying and selling of a little bundle of joy.""

"[Feature] Major movie projects link foreign directors, Korean actors to draw global audiences",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2866181,2022.05.17 16:41,"Surging global demand for K-content drive international productions Famous Korean stars Song Kang-ho, Kang Dong-won, IU and Lee Joo-young entered the theater to take part in a press event held at Yongsan CGV on May 10. Just like every other press event with Korean reporters, the stars introduced their roles in the new film, shared their experiences from the set and posed for photos. However, there was one difference. Director Hirokazu Koreeda joined the event via video conference from Japan. There was also an interpreter for the director. The situation was similar to the press conference for “Vanishing” held in March. The film’s director Denis Dercourt could not be present at the event, and took part via video conference with an interpreter. One of the commonalities between the two films is that they are both directed by foreign directors and shot entirely in Korea with Korean staff and mostly Korean actors. Japanese director Koreeda’s highly anticipated film, which is competing at the Cannes Film Festival running through May 28, centers around the relationships formed through a “baby box,” a unique drop box installed at churches or institutions in Korea for desperate parents who wish to anonymously leave their babies. “Vanishing” depicts the story of Alice (played by Olga Kurylenko), a successful forensic scientist and a Korean police officer (Yoo Yeon-seok). While the two protagonists investigate a murder case in Korea together, they fall in love. Local culture critics suggest that more films like these are being made due to the surging global demand for Korean content. The global success of films like “Minari” (2020) and “Parasite” (2019) and actors like Youn Yuh-jung and Jung Ho-yeon highlight this trend. “These global projects are being made because K-content — ones with a Korean-style storyline or Korean movie stars — are demonstrating potential in the global market,” said film critic Jung Ji-wook. He added that in the case of Koreeda’s film, producers worked with Koreeda not because he is Japanese, but because he is a world-renowned director who can work on projects on a global scale. Culture critic Kim Hern-sik shared a similar opinion. “I would say there is a shift from a localization strategy to globalization. For example, previously global projects were organized to enter a certain market -- to Vietnam, Japan and so on,” Kim said. “As the scale of Korean content grows, I think we have started targeting global audiences rather than audiences of a specific country. I think global projects have evolved in a way.” The critics also went on to explain how recent global projects are different from those from the past. “Earlier global projects did not work well. It was usually like this. If it was a project between Korea and Japan, it had a Korean man and a Japanese woman as protagonists. It focused on attracting audiences from both Korea and Japan, but ended up being neither a Japanese- nor Korean-style movie -- and failed,” Jung said. “And then there were Korean directors working overseas. They were not there as ‘Korean directors’ though. They were there because they are globally renowned directors like Park Chan-wook and Bong Joon-ho.” Both Jung and Kim view the recent changes as progress. “I see the changes as positive. Before, we only thought about global directors like Park Chan-wook working with European actors. Now it is different,” Kim said. Jung also predicts that there will be more cases of foreign directors working with Korean actors and staff. “I am not saying that there will be an instant change, because these movies aim big -- they aim for the world market,” Jung said. “For instance, if we are only talking about the Korean market, when a certain type of movie is successful, then similar films flood the market. We’ve seen this happen,” she said. This is not the case with global projects, because they usually take more time to start, according to Jung. However, she said such projects will continue to be made. Meanwhile, culture critic Kim pointed out that now is a time for to think about what defines Korean movies. “Some people say ‘Pachinko’ has nothing to do with Korea and is not relevant to us. But it was created by Korean Americans who were influenced by Korean content growing up,” Kim said. “I don’t think the content has to be made in Korea to become K-content. So now we need to start having a conversation about what defines K-content, as we expect to see more and more collaboration projects.”",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/05/16/20220516000682_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Once extinct oriental white storks return to farmland,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2863985,2022.05.13 17:38,"Oriental white storks are returning to Korea after more than four decades, with fourth-generation chicks being hatched in the wild. This year, 12 pairs of oriental white storks are nesting in Korea this season and about 30 young storks have hatched including three fourth-generation chicks. While they were once commonly found across Korea, the domestic population drastically dropped after the 1950-1953 Korean War. The birds faced extinction as industrialization starting in the mid 1960s destroyed their natural habitats. In April 1971, the last couple was found nestling in North Chungcheong Province, but shortly after, the male stork was shot dead by a poacher. The species went extinct in 1994 when the bereaved female stork died in captivity. Oriental storks, designated as Korea’s National Monument No. 199, are classified as an endangered species by the Ministry of Environment and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). There are fewer than 3,000 oriental storks living worldwide. In the past, storks -- called “hwang-sae” in Korean -- were common resident birds in the Korean Peninsula. People thought the storks were a symbol of wealth and longevity, bringing good luck and protecting villages. An old proverb in Korean says: “If a crow-tit walks like a stork, it will break its legs.” It means if you overdo something, you will bring hardship on yourself. Oriental storks are large-sized birds, with a body length of 110 to 150 centimeters. They used to be called “han-sae,” which literally means “big bird.” They are relatively larger than European white storks and have a long pointed black beak rather than a red one. Storks in Western folklore are also auspicious symbols. This symbolism was popularized in the 19th century through a Hans Christian Andersen story called “The Storks,” in which storks bring babies to new parents in a basket. Making its long-awaited return In 1996, the Eco Institute for Oriental Stork, based in North Chungcheong Province, began a restoration project in an attempt to revive animals in the country. The center succeeded in breeding storks using imported species from Japan, Russia and Germany. The first pack of storks – six adult storks and two young ones – was released into the wild in 2015. For the past seven years, a research team at the Yesan Stork Park in South Chungcheong Province has released 155 storks, and about 58 percent of them have survived. “We consider the survival rate as ‘satisfactory,’ because more than half of the released animals have survived. Usually the figure goes back and forth between 53 to 58 percent,” said Kim Su-kyung, a senior researcher at the reintroduction research team, to The Korea Herald. She added that there is a steady increase in the number of young storks hatching in the wild. Nineteen were hatched in 2020, 25 in 2021, and 30 chicks in 2022. All twelve pairs have nested in South Chungcheong Province, according to the team. “One of the reasons South Chungcheong Province, and Yesan in particular, was chosen as a restoration site is because there were previous records of storks breeding in this region. There is even a monument commemorating this place as the breeding site,” Kim said. The region still has favorable conditions for storks to live and breed, such as vast farmland or rice fields that serve as wetland and mountains nearby that provide branches for their nests. “The resident storks in Korea were familiar birds to our ancestors, as they had settled in none other than rice paddy fields. Sitting at the top of the food chain, the oriental stork is not only a carnivorous indicator that reflects the health of an entire ecosystem, but also a symbolic indicator that connects to our agricultural society,” explained the researcher. Thus eco-friendly farming methods help storks adapt to their habitat by increasing the number of organisms that inhabit the rice field. Some farmers have dedicated paddies currently not used for rice production to create yearlong “flooded rice paddies.” Still threats remain Although the restoration project is on track, a number of human activities still threaten storks from settling in the wild. On April 25, a male stork was rescued and sent to Chungnam (South Chungcheong) Wildlife Rescue Center, but it died five days later. The center suspects pesticide poisoning. It was the very first stork which was released into the wild in 2015. The stork was named Dae-hwang after the first syllable of the official name of the Republic of Korea, “Daehanminguk.” “There was no sign of skeletal problems, but the stork could not stand straight. It reacted when we prescribed an antidote, but unfortunately it did not survive,” said Kim Ri-hyun, a wild animal rehabilitator at the rescue center. Dae-hwang leaves behind its partner and four chicks. Another stork was sent to the rescue center after it was caught in a snare in April. The stork lost one leg and will not be able to return to the wild. “It is impossible for any bird to survive without a leg, which is an important body part for walking, flying and hunting. The research center decided to take in the injured stork after the treatment,” she added. Including storks in our agricultural landscape “The core value of the restoration project is to improve storks‘ habitats, and therefore revive the whole ecosystem where both humans and wildlife can flourish,” said Kim Su-kyung of the research center. Recently, the center has installed supplementary devices around the rice field to save other living aquatic creatures. A “frog ladder,” for example, helps frogs and other organisms to jump up the paddies preventing certain deaths from roadside drains. “Releasing storks is a simple task, I think. But what we ultimately seek is to restore the whole ecological system to the level where we can see abundant living organisms like in the old days. I hope our efforts to reintroduce the storks consequently enrich the biodiversity and revitalize eco-friendly agriculture as well,” Kim said. Against this backdrop, Yesan, in cooperation with the Korea Rural Community Corporation is launching an eco-friendly complex project with 19.3 billion won ($14.9 million) for the next five years. The goal is to promote a green agricultural society where storks and local farmers can coexist. Major business plans include: developing adequate wetlands for storks, installing green facilities, and building tourist trails around villages. The number of farms which have received certification marks for environment-friendly agricultural products has been steadily decreasing in South Chungcheong Province. They fell by more than half from 9,603 in 2011 to 4,311 in 2020, according to the National Agricultural Products Quality Management Service. “The graying agricultural population is one reason for the downturn. Also the fact that there is not much difference in price between eco-friendly rice and chemically-sprayed rice discourages the farmers,” Kim explained. “But what we want is a landscape with storks. We cannot continue on this restoration forever. I hope one day in the future, humans and storks can live in harmony just like other wild birds.”",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/05/13/20220513000612_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
'He’s like the sun’: Director Koreeda praises veteran actor Song Kang-ho,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2863121,2022.05.11 16:50,"Even for veteran director Hirokazu Koreeda, who won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2018 for “Shoplifters,” directing a movie in a foreign country was a challenge. During a press conference at CGV Yongsan in Seoul on Tuesday, the Japanese director said he got a lot of help from “Parasite” star Song Kang-ho while filming his movie, “Broker.” “Before shooting the film, I had a meeting with director Bong Joon-ho. We talked over a meal and he gave me suggestions on shooting a film in a foreign country. He said I must be nervous directing a movie in a foreign country, but once everything begins, all I have to do is believe in Song Kang-ho,” the director said. “He told me that Song Kang-ho is like a sun that will shine light everywhere on the filming site. After I worked with him, I realized that he (Bong) was right. Because of Song, I was able to finish the project without any problem.” Koreeda’s highly anticipated film centers around the relationships formed through a “baby box,” a drop box installed at churches or institutions for desperate parents to leave babies anonymously. It aims to prevent those parents from abandoning or even killing their newborns. Song plays Sang-hyun, a mysterious “broker” who finds new parents for the abandoned babies and makes special deals with them. Korean heartthrob Gang Dong-won plays Sang-hyun’s business partner. Bae Doo-na plays a police officer who is on Sang-hyun’s trail. Singer and actor IU plays a mother who travels with Sang-hyun to find parents for her baby. During the press conference, Song recalled his first meeting with the director in Busan. “It was six or seven years ago, we met for the first time at the Busan International Film Festival. The title was not ‘Broker’ at the time,” Song said. “I decided to take the role because I am his fan and I love his works. He is an artist that I respect, so I was honored.” The director also briefly talked about the movie being selected to premiere at the upcoming Cannes Film Festival. “No matter how many times I’ve been there, Cannes always makes me nervous. I am also excited to be there. I think it is the best place for the world premiere of ‘Broker’,” the director said. The 75th Cannes Film Festival will run from May 17-28. Meanwhile, at the beginning of the press event, Song stood up and talked about the late Korean actor Kang Soo-youn, who died from cerebral hemorrhage on Saturday at the age of 55. “We actors are grieving over the tragic news from a few days ago,” Song said. “On behalf of the whole ‘Broker’ team, I offer condolences to Kang Soo-youn.” “Broker” will hit local theaters on June 8.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/05/10/20220510000717_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
World Forestry Congress kicks off its 5-day run in Seoul,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2855537,2022.05.01 17:08,"The World Forestry Congress, the world‘s largest gathering of foresters, kicked off its five-day run in Seoul on Monday. The 15th edition of the WFC will be running from Monday through Friday at Coex in Gangnam. The WFC is the most influential global forestry gathering, held every six years under the auspices of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. It’s the first time the WFC has been held in South Korea, and it is also the first time in 44 years that the congress is being held in the Asia-Pacific region. It was last hosted in the region by Indonesia in 1978. The congress is designed to allow people from the world’s forestry sector to strengthen international cooperation with forest supporters and related partners. The event has also functioned as a forum that provides participants with opportunities to exchange views and experiences on all aspects of forestry and the environment. By sharing expertise and experiences, the event aims to help identify the actions required to solve pending issues across the world. Park Eun-sik, director general of international affairs bureau at the Korea Forest Service, said “(The government) has put its utmost efforts into the congress over the last two years, for which the country may not get another chance to host at another time.” This year‘s congress is anticipated to be the largest ever, with the participation of around 10,000 people, including government officials, members of international organizations, civic activists and academics from over a total of 143 countries. The KFS estimates about 2,000 participants will visit from overseas. The number of local participants who pre-registered is about 5,300 so far. Distinguished guests from abroad include United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. The leaders of international organizations, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the Global Environment Facility and the International Renewable Energy Agency, will be also joining the congress. Forest and related ministries from more than 40 countries will attend the event to discuss policies regarding forests and the environment. Under the theme of “Building a Green, Healthy and Resilient Future with Forests,” the latest edition of the congress will offer a unique opportunity for the global forestry community to consider the current state and future of world forestry, particularly in the context of global climate change, according to the KFS. The event will work as a place to discuss relevant measures to achieve the sustainable development goals. High-level meetings and special events throughout the congress will also become venues for debate on pending challenges such as global climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. The congress has prepared six sub-themes to address the most important current issues concerning forests, through which it will address the importance of restoring and preserving forests and the ways forestation can play its part in achieving carbon neutrality and responding to climate change. The six sub-themes include, Turning the tide: Reversing deforestation and forest degradation; Nature-based solutions for climate change adaptation and biodiversity conservation; The green pathway to growth and sustainability; Forests and human health: Revisiting the connections; Managing and communicating forest information, data, and knowledge; and Forests without boundaries: Enhancing management and cooperation. During the event, South Korea will also promote its experiences of reforestation to attendees from all over the world. According to the KFS, South Korea’s successful history of reforestation has already been recognized worldwide. The country’s reforestation since the Korean War, in particular, is regarded by many international organizations as one of the most successful initiatives of its kind. Before 1970, forests were destroyed as the country used trees as its main natural resource. The destruction of forests in the country consequently brought about avalanches, floods and other disasters. As more people began noticing the importance of forests, the government stepped up. The government took initiatives and supported reforestation through various policies. The government analyzed the survival rates of trees in different regions to create a better tree-management system. Illegal logging was cracked down on. The government provided incentives to public officers based on how many trees they planted and began introducing eco-friendly policies to develop a better environment for tree growth. To prevent slash-and-burn agriculture, the government also provided new settlements and jobs to the farmers. After decades of effort, South Korea was able to restore many forests across the country. A 2019 UN Food and Agriculture Organization report showed that South Korea had the highest rate of increasing forest stock in the Asia-Pacific region between 1990 and 2015. South Korea‘s successful reforestation history was recognized worldwide, and the KFS started to share its reforestation know-how. In the earlier stage, the country shared its know-hows with Mongolia and China, but now, the country is handing down reforestation techniques to many more countries, including Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar and other Southeast Asian countries, as well as countries in Central Asia, South America and Africa. Prior to hosting the WFC this year, South Korea also held a series of forest-related international congresses, such as the IUFRO World Congress in 2010, the UNCCD Congress in 2011, and the International Wildland Fire Conference in 2015. Park said South Korea would do its best to successfully host the congress, adding that the congress will help the country strengthen its global leadership in the forestry sector.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/04/29/20220429000583_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Psy collaborates with BTS’ Suga for new single ‘That That’,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2852482,2022.04.26 17:51,"Global world star Psy has teamed up with Suga of K-pop phenomenon BTS for his new album, “Psy 9th.” Psy’s agency P Nation on Tuesday revealed Suga collaborated with the “Gangnam Style” hitmaker’s new song “That That,” which will front Psy’s ninth full-length album. Suga co-produced “That That” with Psy, taking part in the overall production from lyrics-writing to composition and arrangement, the agency said. A teaser video of “That That” released on social media on Tuesday shows Psy donning a cowboy outfit and running wildly toward the camera in the streets of a Western town as a sentimental guitar instrumental plays in the background. In a separate teaser video for the song, the BTS member and Psy each spoke about their experience of working together. Working with the veteran artist, Suga said he had initially felt “nervous.” But with time, he said the two musicians “became besties in a way.” “It felt like working with a childhood friend, so it made the song-writing process that much more fun.” The 44-year-old artist said he usually makes an effort so that younger artists do not feel uncomfortable around him, but with Suga, Psy said he barely felt the age gap. “He wasn’t just my junior in the business but I felt he was truly my friend,” he said, adding, “If he thinks of me as a bestie, that’s great for me.” “That That” is the latest track to be revealed from Psy’s upcoming album “Psy 9th,” which consists of 12 tracks all produced in collaboration with some of the biggest musicians in the K-pop scene. Among those that have been revealed are, “Celeb” featuring Bae Suzy, “Happier” featuring R&B singer Crush, “Now” featuring Hwasa of Mamamoo, “Sleepless” featuring Heize, “Forever” featuring Tablo of hip-hop trio Epik High and “You Move Me” featuring the veteran balladeer Sung Si-kyung. “Psy 9th” will be released at 6 p.m. on Friday. The upcoming record marks Psy’s return with a new full-length album in almost five years, since he dropped his eighth LP, “4X2=8,” in 2017 under his longtime agency YG Entertainment. In 2018, Psy departed from YG and established his own label, P Nation, the following year. He soon signed with various artists, including Korean American rapper Jessi, K-pop soloist Hyuna and former member of boy band Pentagon, Dawn, and singer Heize. Psy, whose real name is Park Jae-sang, officially debuted as a singer in 2001 with his first album “Psy from the Psycho World!.” He has dug out his own niche of addictive and danceable music, and became an unexpected breakout success when his 2012 single “Gangnam Style” went viral. As the song’s “horse dance” craze spread, “Gangnam Style” became the first video on YouTube to rack up 1 billion views and then to 2 billion views since the video platform was launched in 2005. He became the first South Korean artist to rank on the top 10 of Billboard Hot 100 chart with the song, peaking at No. 2 on the singles chart -- the highest point reached by a Korean artist then. “Gangnam Style” was later ranked No. 1 on Billboard’s decade-end charts for streaming songs of the 2010s. Meanwhile, Suga is a seasoned producer for both the group’s music and solo works, the latter of which he drops under the alias Agust D. He has also collaborated with numerous artists, including singer-songwriter IU for her 2020 single “Eight,” Halsey for “Suga’s Interlude,” veteran musician Lee Sora’s “Song Request,” Epik High’s “Sleepless,” to name a few.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/04/26/20220426000757_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Octapharma to address unmet needs in von Willebrand disease as a proud sponsor of WFH 2022 World Congress,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2852479,2022.04.26 17:20,"LACHEN, Switzerland, April 26, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- As part of its ongoing commitment to the global bleeding disorders community, Octapharma is pleased to be a Gold Sponsor of the upcoming World Federation of Haemophilia (WFH) 2022 World Congress, taking place from May 8 to 11, 2022. This continues Octapharma's long history of involvement and support of the WFH World Congress and the WFH community. This year's Congress will be a hybrid meeting bringing together international attendees in-person in Montréal, Canada, with select sessions broadcast through the Congress's virtual platform. As part of its ""Under the Spotlight"" series, Octapharma will highlight key unmet needs of people living with von Willebrand disease (VWD) during a live symposium. Attendees will have the opportunity to raise questions during the Q&A session. The symposium will be streamed in real-time to virtual Congress attendees, and available on-demand to participants after the Congress. VWD affects males and females equally but is diagnosed more frequently in women due to bleeding associated with menstruation and childbirth. Guidelines for managing these issues are, however, inadequate. The Octapharma symposium will follow the story of Suzanne, a young woman with VWD, and her experiences with heavy menstrual bleeding, pregnancy complications and surgery, and the transformative impact effective treatment has had on her life. The symposium, entitled ""From clinical insights to patient experience: Suzanne's journey with von Willebrand disease,"" will be held on Tuesday May 10, 08:00–09:00 EST. The chair, Dr Fernando F. Corrales-Medina will be joined by a faculty of international experts comprised of Drs Michelle Sholzberg, Jill Johnsen and Alok Srivastava. In addition to Suzanne's story, the faculty will present recent data and ongoing studies on the management of heavy menstrual bleeding, perioperative bleeding, and childbirth in people with VWD, including the role of VWF/FVIII concentrates such as wilate® in these situations. Larisa Belyanskaya, Head of Octapharma's IBU Haematology, said, ""Hearing the experiences of patients and their families affected by bleeding disorders reminds us of the significance of our work."" Olaf Walter, Board Member of Octapharma, commented, ""WFH is a valuable forum for interaction, collaboration and sharing knowledge with global experts and diverse members of the international bleeding disorder community.

Three Korean films to be screened at Cannes,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2841573,2022.04.15 15:44,"One of the most recognized film festivals worldwide, Cannes Film Festival announced its official selection list for this year Thursday, including three Korean films-- “Decision to Leave,” directed by Park Chan-wook, “Broker” directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda and “Squid Game” star Lee Jung-jae’s directorial debut “Hunt.” Park and Kore-eda’s films were invited to the festival’s main competition category. A total of 18 contenders were listed in this category on Thursday. “At Cannes this year, I’m going to watch as many films as I can. I am also ready to give a longer standing ovation than anybody,” Park said in a statement. Park’s new movie centers on a polite and honest police officer named Hye-jun (Park Hye-il). Hye-jun looks into a suspicious death that occurred on a mountain and comes to suspect the dead man’s wife, the mysterious Seo-rae (Tang Wei). At the same time, Hye-jun becomes attracted to her. The script of “Decision to Leave” was co-written with Jeong Seo-kyeong, with whom Park has worked on multiple films, including “I’m a Cyborg, but That’s OK” (2006), “Thirst” (2009) and “The Handmaiden” (2016). “Broker” is Kore-eda’s first Korean movie. The Japanese director, who won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2018 for “Shoplifters,” wrote and directed the new Korean film and worked with CJ ENM, the entertainment unit of South Korean conglomerate CJ Group, which financed and produced the project. It features famous Korean actors including Song Kang-ho, Bae Doo-na, Gang Dong-won and IU. “Parasite” star Song and “Oldboy” director Park, who worked together on “Thirst” in 2009, will be competing against each other this year. At that time, Park’s film “Thirst” won Prix du Jury prize at Cannes that year. The Korean director Park was also awarded the Grand Prix, the second-highest prize at the festival, for his thriller “Old Boy” in 2004. Bong Joon-ho’s “Parasite” starring Song grabbed the highest honor at the Cannes Film Festival in 2019. Both Park and Kore-eda’s films are set to hit local theaters in June. Actor-turned-filmmaker Lee’s spy thriller “Hunt,” staring Korean heartthrob Jung Woo-sung, was invited to screen at the Midnight Screening, a non-competitive section of the festival. Lee also appears in the movie as one of the leading actors. Set in the 1980s, elite agent Park Pyung-ho (Lee) works at the Agency for National Security Planning and got a mission to chase after a North Korean spy. While doing that he becomes increasingly aware of his own country’s dark truths. “It’s a great honor to have my directorial debut feature screened at Cannes,” Lee said in a statement. Lee participated in the film festival in 2010, in relation to his appearance in “The Housemaid.” The 75th Cannes Film Festival will run from May 17-28.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/04/15/20220415000473_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

It is the first Korean movie directed by Koreeda, the Palme d’Or winner at the Cannes Film Festival in 2018 for “Shoplifters.“ The highly anticipated film centers around the relationships formed through a “baby box.” The baby box is a drop box installed at churches or institutions where desperate parents can leave behind babies anonymously to prevent them from abandoning or even killing their newborn. “Parasite” star Song plays broker Sang-hyun who finds parents to adopt the abandoned babies and makes special deals with them. Korean heartthrob Gang plays Sang-hyun’s business partner. Fans can look forward to a repeat of the firecracker performance between Song and Gang in “Secret Reunion” directed by Jang Hun in 2010. K-pop artist and actor IU, also known as Lee Ji-eun, plays a mother who returns to the baby box for her child.

'Money Game' first Korean webtoon adapted for US reality show,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2817238,2022.03.16 15:12,"Thriller webtoon “Money Game” has become the first Korean webtoon to be made into a web-based entertainment show in the US. Though a local adaptation of the webtoon series was made last year on Korean YouTube channel Jin Yong-jin, this is the first time a Korean webtoon’s IP is being adapted by foreign creators, production team and cast, according to Naver Webtoon. The five-part reality show on YouTube channel Jubilee features eight participants who are kept in separate cells in a facility for 10 days, seeking to win the maximum amount of prize money. The players will share a pool of $300,000 and aim to keep all the money during the 10-day survival. Helmed by director Mark Arbitrario, who was behind the TV series “Survivor” (2007) and “The Voice” (2014), “Money Game” makes for a compelling show as the participants have diverse racial and religious backgrounds and are from all walks of life. The first episode of the show was uploaded Monday and the subsequent episodes are set to be released on the same day every week. The original webtoon, written by author Bae Jin-soo in 2018, centers around a bankrupt man who participates in a survival game to win money. Eight competitors spend 100 days together in an isolated place and have to share a total of 44.8 billion won ($37 million), where consumer prices are 1,000 times more expensive than in the real world. “I had never imagined that my work would be adapted into an entertainment show overseas,” a Naver Webtoon press release quoted “Money Game” author Bae Jin-soo as saying. “I can feel that the status of Korean webtoon IP has risen, not only in Korea but also abroad.” Webtoon “Money Game” and its sequel “Pie Game” are being reproduced into an eight-part drama series in Korea, starring singer and actor IU, actors Ryu Jun-yeol and Park Jeong-min.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/03/16/20220316000377_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

At the annual music awards ceremony held at Nodeul Live House on Nodeul Island, central Seoul, Tuesday, the quartet took home the song of the year award for its megahit “Next Level,” which dropped May last year. “Next Level” also won the newly created best K-pop song category and the group took home rookie of the year award. After its debut in November 2020 with the single “Black Mamba,” aespa has generated a buzz in the K-pop industry with its unique concept -- the members also have alter egos in the virtual world, or metaverse. The single “Next Level,” is a rearrangement of the original soundtrack from the 2019 action film “Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw.” In their acceptance speech, the members of aespa thanked those who made covers for “Next Level” and followed the song’s signature dance move that looks like a shape of the Korean consonant digeut. They said they would continue to sing higher quality songs and work harder this year. Singer-songwriter Lang Lee, band Soumbalgwang and alt-electronic duo Haepaary also had a big night, each winning two prizes. Lang Lee was named the winner of album of the year and best folk album for her third album “There Is a Wolf.” Soumbalgwang nabbed trophies for best rock song and best rock album for “Dance” and “Happiness, Flower,” respectively. Haepaary received awards for best electronic song and best electronic album for “Go to GPD and Then” and “Born by Gorgeousness,” respectively.

The best K-pop album prize went to Chungha for her first studio album “Querencia.” Singer-songwriter IU and sibling duo AKMU received best pop song award and best pop album award, respectively, for “Nakka (with IU)” and “Lilac.” Punk rock band Crying Nut’s Han Kyung-rock and Korea Jazz Guardians won a special award given by the selection committee in recognition of their work designing albums and performances to promote the local music industry amid the pandemic. The Korean Music Awards focuses on artists’ musical achievements as the primary criterion, unlike other local music awards that determine each year’s winners based on singers’ popularity and album and song sales figures. The annual awards recognized winners in 25 categories this year for albums and songs released here from December 2020 to November last year. A panel of music critics, radio show producers and music industry professionals determine the winners.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/03/02/20220302000595_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

Inaugural Arabian Leopard Day kicks off across the region and shines a spotlight on saving the species,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2786158,2022.02.11 11:00,"Being held on February 10, the first-ever Arabian Leopard Day focuses international attention on important and ongoing conservation efforts in AlUla and beyond MoU signed by His Highness Prince Badr bin Abdulla bin Mohammad bin Farhan Al-Saud, Governor of AlUla and Minister of Culture, and Her Royal Highness Princess Reema bint Bandar bin Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, KSA Ambassador to the US and Founder of Catmosphere Plans for protection and conservation of iconic big cat species are fully aligned with Royal Commission for AlUla's environmental and sustainability ambitions for north-west Arabia ALULA, Saudi Arabia, Feb. 11, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Iconic buildings and historic landmarks in Saudi Arabia, Oman and the UAE will be proudly lit up this evening to mark the first-ever Arabian Leopard Day. Stunning illuminations, inspired by the majestic but Critically Endangered big cats, will be simultaneously projected on Riyadh's King Faisal Foundation building, Jeddah's King Road Tower, Adeer Tower in Al Khobar, Elephant Rock in AlUla, plus Burj Khalifa and KSA's Expo 2020 pavilion in Dubai as well as a highly prominent electronic billboard on Sultan Qaboos University Road in Muscat, Oman. To view the Multimedia News Release, please click: https://www.multivu.com/players/uk/9015551-inaugural-arabian-leopard-day-kicks-off-spotlight-saving-the-species/ Across the region Arabian Leopard Day is also being marked with classroom education initiatives as well as social media outreach throughout the day with the hashtag #ArabianLeopardDay. And in a public show of support, many government entities across Saudi Arabia will incorporate the official Arabian Leopard Day logo on their websites and social media today. In an important step forward, the Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) today signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Catmosphere foundation to strengthen regional efforts to protect the future of the Arabian Leopard. RCU and Catmosphere will work closely together on a series of sustainable and innovative events, campaigns, and outreach initiatives research with the shared goal of safeguarding the future of the Arabian Leopard, an animal of national pride in Saudi Arabia and around the region. The inaugural Arabian Leopard Day highlights the desperate plight of the species, which once freely roamed the Arabian Peninsula but is now restricted to small, scattered populations in Saudi Arabia, Oman and Yemen. His Highness Prince Badr bin Abdulla bin Mohammad bin Farhan Al-Saud, Governor of AlUla and Minister of Culture, said: ""The signing of the MoU supports RCU's Arabian Leopard conservation programme, which is at the heart of extensive sustainable development plans for the wider AlUla region. This agreement also significantly strengthens existing partnerships with entities concerned with the conservation of natural fauna and flora, including the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)."" Her Royal Highness Princess Reema bint Bandar Al-Saud, Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to the United States and founder of Catmosphere, said: ""The signing of this new MoU supports Catmosphere's mission to secure a future for Big Cats, including the Arabian Leopard. It builds momentum around regional conservation efforts with a focus on supporting RCU as it strives to achieve its far-reaching ambitions to reintroduce the species to the wild."" Amr AlMadani, CEO, Royal Commission for AlUla, said: ""The Arabian Leopard is a powerful symbol of RCU's aim to conserve and safeguard AlUla's natural environment through far-reaching conservation efforts designed to protect the natural flora and fauna of this incredible part of north-west Arabia. It is a sad reality that the Arabian Leopard is Critically Endangered. Ongoing threats to its natural habitat highlight the pressing need to step up conservation efforts that are so vital to the species' long-term survival. We really want people to mark Arabian Leopard Day and engage with activities to raise awareness of, and help to protect, these majestic big cats."" The Arabian Leopard is emblematic of Saudi Arabia and RCU's extensive environmental sustainability ambitions. The species occupies a unique place in the collective consciousness and imagination of the region; images of the big cat have been found in ancient rock art, have inspired folk tales, and are even used in modern everyday expressions. Numbering fewer than 200 in the wild, the Arabian Leopard is categorised as Critically Endangered by the IUCN and is considered to be at an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. Last year's birth of a female cub at the Arabian Leopard Breeding Centre in Taif, Saudi Arabia, highlighted the great potential for reintroducing the species into the wilderness and mountains around AlUla and beyond. However, there remains a long and difficult road ahead with efforts ongoing to establish a protected habitat to restore the population. RCU, which is regenerating a 22,561km2 area of north-west Saudi Arabia as a global destination for natural and cultural heritage, has committed USD 25 million to the Arabian Leopard Fund, an independent organisation created to implement conservation projects across the leopard's home range. RCU has designated five nature reserves covering 12,500km2 and will be working with leading experts such as Panthera and IUCN to activate, conserve and safeguard these protected areas with a vision that leopards might someday roam free again. Saudi Arabia's Council of Ministers has designated Arabian Leopard Day to take place on 10 February each year. Note to editors: It is always AlUla. We will be providing photographs this evening of the landmarks featuring Arabian Leopard Day imagery. The landmarks will light up simultaneously at 7.10pm KSA. Further, please find collateral including a toolkit, and FAQ here. About the Royal Commission for AlUla The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) was established by royal decree in July 2017 to preserve and develop AlUla, a region of outstanding natural and cultural significance in north-west Saudi Arabia. RCU's long-term plan outlines a responsible, sustainable, and sensitive approach to urban and economic development, that preserves the area's natural and historic heritage, while establishing AlUla as a desirable location to live, work, and visit. This encompasses a broad range of initiatives across archaeology, tourism, culture, education, and the arts, reflecting a commitment to meeting the economic diversification, local community empowerment, and heritage preservation priorities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 programme.

Four popular Korean dramas to be remade into musicals,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2763058,2022.01.17 10:25,"Popular Korean TV series will return to the stage as musicals to meet the rising demand from fans who long to enjoy their favorite shows in diversified formats. The smash-hit rom-com ""Crash Landing On You"" (2019) with Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin in starring roles will come back in the form of a musical in September at COEX in southern Seoul. The 16-episode ""Crash Landing On You,"" which aired simultaneously on the South Korean cable channel tvN and Netflix, is about star-crossed lovers from the two Koreas, depicting the political and geographical division on the Korean Peninsula. It became one of the most popular South Korean TV series in recent years, marking the highest viewership for a drama series of the cable channel. It also topped the most-viewed Netflix charts in many Asian regions, including Japan. Details of the musical production, including casting for the lead roles, have not yet been disclosed. A musical adaptation of the 1994 medical thriller ""M"" will start its Seoul run next month at an arts theater in Dongguk University. Starring Shim Eun-ha, the MBC TV series became the talk of the town for its suspenseful storyline involving abortion and its special visual effects featuring the green eyes of the main character. M, the soul of an aborted child, enters the body of the young girl and controls her to seek revenge on the people who would not allow him to be born.

Access Advance Announces the Initial Group of VVC/H.266 Video Patent Pool Licensors,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2759825,2022.01.12 00:21,"Twenty-Eight (28) Patent Owners Became Licensors BOSTON, Jan. 11, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Access Advance today announced that twenty-eight (28) companies, which together are estimated to account for a substantial percentage of the expected VVC standard essential patent (""SEP"") landscape, have joined as Licensors of the VVC Advance Patent Pool. VVC (""Versatile Video Coding"") is the next generation video codec standard finalized less than eighteen (18) months ago, which provides significant improvements in video compression of up to 50% over HEVC, enabling a new generation of products, ever more beautiful video, faster downloads, lower latency, and improved savings on storage. The list of VVC Advance Licensors includes the following: Alibaba Singapore Holding Private Limited ARRIS Enterprises LLC, a CommScope Company B1 Institute of Image Technology, INC. Company to be disclosed at a later date Dolby Laboratories, Inc. Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute GE Video Compression, LLC Godo Kaisha IP Bridge 1 HFI Innovation Inc.

Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) Research & Business Foundation Toshiba Corporation University-Industry Cooperation Group of Kyung Hee University XRIS Corporation ""This is a tremendous endorsement of the VVC Advance Patent Pool and our Video Codec Platform Initiative, and we thank each of the patent owners that have placed their trust in Access Advance to license their VVC SEP patent assets,"" stated Pete Moller, CEO of Access Advance. ""Launching a patent pool for a ground-breaking technology like VVC is a long and multi-stage process. We worked with over fifty (50) patent owners for well over 18 months to establish the structure of the program and launched the VVC Advance Patent Pool on schedule July 1, 2021. We are excited that a significant majority of these patent owners have now officially joined the program as Licensors. These Licensors provide a critical mass of VVC SEPs, and an important assurance to the market that VVC Advance, just like HEVC Advance, will provide long-term value through a balanced and successful program."" ""We look forward to working with the remaining patent owners who are still going through their decision-making process and expect that many of them will make the decision to join VVC Advance over the next six (6) months,"" continued Mr. Moller. ""There are significant incentives for patent owners and patent implementers who join the program by June 30, 2022. These include bonus patent points for Licensors, and very significant early signing cap incentives for Licensees."" The VVC Advance Patent Pool is part of the Access Advance Video Codec Platform Initiative that seamlessly incorporates HEVC and VVC technologies into a single discounted royalty rate structure with simplified reporting and payment obligations for Licensees whose products include both codecs. This innovation responds to the market's desire for an even more efficient next-generation pool licensing structure. Licensees that have executed both the HEVC Advance Platform Patent Portfolio License (""PPL"") and the VVC Advance Platform PPL have the option to enjoy additional benefits via execution of the new Multi-Codec Bridging Agreement (""MCBA""). The MCBA is not a third license; rather, it is an administrative agreement that bridges the HEVC Advance License and the VVC Advance License for implementers who have executed both licenses and the MCBA itself. Those Licensees will enjoy a discounted royalty rate for each of the HEVC and VVC codecs in their multi-codec products that are sold after MCBA execution, that results in the same royalty rate as they would pay for a product that includes only VVC. Royalty payments under the VVC Advance Platform PPL are required for sales of VVC products starting January 1, 2022. Access Advance encourages interested parties to act quickly to take advantage of the incentives and discounted MCBA rates as discussed above. About Access Advance: Access Advance LLC (formerly HEVC Advance LLC) is an independent licensing administrator company formed to lead the development, administration, and management of patent pools for licensing essential patents of the most important standards-based video codec technologies.

"BTS, IU win top prizes at 36th Golden Disc Awards",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2757500,2022.01.09 12:53,"BTS and IU won the top prizes Saturday at the 36th Golden Disc Awards, the annual South Korean event that honors achievements in the local music industry. BTS took home album of the year award at a ceremony at Seoul’s Gocheok Sky Dome for its album “Be,” which was released in November 2020. It was the fifth consecutive year that the group won the top honor in the album category. The group also won three additional awards, including the Seezn most popular artist award, digital song and best album. BTS did not attend the ceremony as the members are on a long-term break. Instead, the boy band appeared in a video message and thanked its fans. “‘Be’ was an album through which we aimed to deliver a message of hope to those suffering due to COVID-19, but we have instead received a lot of comfort from many others. We’d like to share this honor with Army, who always support us,” BTS leader RM said during the acceptance speech. Army refers to BTS fans. IU also had a big night, grabbing the top award in the digital song division with her hit “Celebrity,” which was released in March last year. It marked the singer’s second consecutive year winning digital song of the year. She also received awards for digital song and best album. “Last year was a very meaningful one for me. Closing out my 20s, I worked hard to promote music as I thought it was the best way to express my sincere gratitude to the fans who have been with me for the last 10 years. It feels like I’ve ended my 20s well with people listening to my music, loving me for so long and giving me such a big award like this,” she said. Girl groups Aespa and StayC took home rookie of the year awards. Aespa also won the Cosmopolitan artist award, digital song and artist of the year. StayC received the award for digital song as well.

Sales accounted for 60 percent of the final score, with expert evaluation accounting for 40 percent. Meanwhile, this year’s music award ceremony was held without a live audience due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Atlas Renewable Energy Recognized by SEAL Awards for Environmental Initiative with Primates,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2752989,2022.01.05 05:00,"SEAL Awards recognizes Atlas Renewable Energy with its Business Sustainability Award in the Environmental Initiatives Category MIAMI, Jan. 5, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Atlas Renewable Energy, a global renewable energy generation company, has been recognized as SEAL Awards' Business Sustainability winner under the Environmental Initiative Award Category. Atlas was recognized for its environmental activity to preserve and protect the Howler Monkey species near its 444MW photovoltaic project La Pimienta, located in Mexico's municipality of Carmen in the state of Campeche. The program consists of three main environmental benefits including the conservation of 300 hectares of secondary vegetation of the evergreen forest patches in the area, the creation of biological corridors to connect the forest patches that surround the solar plant, and the conservation of the Black Howler Monkey Habitat, which is an endangered species that has been red-listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUNC). ""Helping preserve biodiversity and improve local species' habitats near our renewable energy projects is of utmost importance and this is always taken into consideration in the design phase of a project,"" said Eddaly Cuesta, ESG Manager for Colombia and Mexico at Atlas Renewable Energy. ""Seeing this program develop from a basic idea to a program with tangible results is very fulfilling from both a personal and professional perspective. Everything was possible thanks to the great leadership within Atlas, which understands that protecting and preserving biodiversity is an essential part of the development of our projects."" The environmental initiative aligns with Atlas' ESG pillar for biodiversity protection which intends to help protect and maintain environments and species near our renewable energy projects. With this, Atlas aims to motivate others within the industry and foster even more commitment toward the preservation and conservation of species and habitats. Within this pillar, Atlas has executed reforestation activities, donated seedlings, held workshops for environmental education, and has helped toward the conservation of different species across Chile, Brazil, and Mexico. ""We have a commitment as clean energy generators to provide power and to do so as sustainably as possible. Taking care of the ecosystems in which we operate is a priority for Atlas, not because it is required but because it's the right thing to do. That's why we often go above and beyond local regulations and do more than what is expected in this sense. I'm very proud of what Atlas has achieved, and the support from the other divisions within the company, such as EPC and Development, which have been fundamental in the materialization of this program"", said Maria Jose Cortes, Head of ESG at Atlas Renewable Energy. ""Thank you SEAL Awards for this recognition and thank you to our trusted partners such as BIOS, ERM, Ecology Institute AC, and IDB Invest for being such an important element during the development and execution of this initiative."" The first phase of the project, which consisted of the relocation of individual howler monkeys and the creation of corridors to connect forest patches, is well underway. Currently, the program is moving into phase two, which consists of monitoring the Black Howler monkey population for the next couple of years to ensure their wellbeing, executing reforestation actions and preserving the forest patches that continue to be connected by the biological corridors. ""The environmental merits of renewable energy are consistent and obvious,"" said Matt Harney, Founder of SEAL Awards. ""Our judging panel found Atlas' prioritization of conservation and biodiversity in its La Pimienta Solar Project to be unique and exemplary.

"BTS, 'Squid Game' sweep Instagram hashtags across world this year",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2740938,2021.12.14 15:03,"Home-styling, camping among the most-used hashtags on Instagram in S. Korea, official says Global K-pop stars BTS and Netflix hit series Squid Game were among the most popular hashtags across the world on Instagram this year, Instagram Korea said Tuesday. “Popular contents and accounts on Instagram in 2021 reflected the most notable social and cultural phenomena of this year, such as the dance craze, K-content syndrome, and the Tokyo Olympics,“ Meta Korea’s CEO Jung Ki-hyun said in an online press conference. “Instagram will continue to allow the users to freely express what they like, get new inspiration through each other’s content and create new culture and trends.” Aside from the Korean culture phenomena, home-styling such as interior tips, and camping became two of the hottest hashtags that most users found interest in, he added. Although all seven members of BTS had just opened their official Instagram accounts last week, they were among the fastest-growing accounts, according to Instagram Korea. K-pop girl band Blackpink, singer IU and dancer Noze were among a list of celebrities that saw their popularity spike on Instagram. Actors in Squid Game, including Jung Ho-yeon who played the role of participant number 67 in the survival competition, also garnered millions of new followers. Instagram’s Reels, where users can edit together a collage of short video clips under a minute, was one of the most popular functions on the social media platform, officials said. According to Instagram Korea, posts under the categories of humor, animals, dance and food gained the most traction. “Reels has attracted more love from users over time and it’s becoming a new beginning point that creates new trends,” an Instagram Korea official said in the online press conference. Artists used Reels to post popular dance challenges and invited others to follow suit. Instagram said not only did the platform provide an opportunity for celebrities to connect with fans, but also allowed brands to expand their reach.

LG Electronics, another successful brand account on Instagram, used augmented reality technology that enabled users to see how it would look like to have LG’s product in their homes. “We plan to help large and small businesses to sail toward bigger goals through many programs such as Boost with Facebook and Instagram Academy,” Jung said.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2021/12/14/20211214000613_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Photographers reinterpret images of their cultural heritage,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2740156,2021.12.13 16:20,"The legacy of renowned modern sculptor Kwon Jin-kyu (1922-1973) lives on today, serving as a source of inspiration for many young artists. The sculptural masterpieces were recently brought to life by fashion photographer Mok Jung-wook, who creates his own narratives through photographs. 　The exhibition “Images of Eternity: Kwon Jin Kyu × Mok Jungwook” running through Dec. 28 at PKM Gallery in Seoul presents 8 self-portraits and religious sculptures by Kwon along with a series of Mok’s photographs of the sculptures. 　While the sculptures and some 30 photography works appear to be in harmony, there is also a palpable tension emanating from the different works by the two artists. In trying to reinterpret the sculptures, Mok said he has struggled to capture the perfect shot. 　“I think photography is all about energy. The energy of the subject is reflected in a photograph,” Mok said. “Kwon’s sculptures can be seen as lumps of clay, but for some reason, I had a strange feeling that the sculptures were staring at me. It was such a powerful experience that I was very sick overnight after the shoot.” 　As a pioneer of modern sculpture in Korea, Kwon established his artistic world by pursing figurative sculptures inspired by his own self-portraits, animals and religious subjects, defying the prevailing trend of abstract sculptures at the time. Kwon is well known for his unique techniques in creating sculptures -- baking terra cotta and applying sap from lacquer trees. 　“I came up with the exhibition after thinking about how Kwon’s works could reach younger people in a more familiar way and interact better with them. Mok is a renowned photographer in today’s fashion field,” said Park Kyung-mee who founded the gallery in 2001 in Samcheong-dong, central Seoul. 　Born in 1980, Mok is a well sought-after photographer who focuses on portrait photography. He has worked with numerous K-pop artists on their album covers, including Exo, Blackpink, IU, and Suzy. He also was in charge of shooting BTS’ Time magazine cover photo this year. 　At Gallery Baton in Hannam-dong, central Seoul, an exhibition shows how images from American romance comic books are reinterpreted by New York-based photographer Anne Collier. Collier sources the images from vintage American romance comic books that targeted adolescent female readers at the time. The cropped images allow viewers to reflect on the cliched narratives that tend to reinforce a submissive image of women. Collier’s “Woman Crying (Comic)” and “Tear (Comic)” show close-up images of women with a tear rolling down a cheek, a nod to the early works of Roy Lichtenstein. Some of her works are collected by globally renowned museums including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, US and the Whitney Museum of American Art. Her work was previously exhibited in Korea at the Gwangju Biennale in 2010. 　The “Anne Collier” exhibition runs through Dec. 23.

Mystic Story’s first girl group Billlie debuts with star-studded ‘Ring X Ring’,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2723534,2021.11.10 19:57,"Backed by Yoon Jong-shin, Kim Eana and Lia Kim, Billlie makes a splash arrival Mystic Story, a subsidiary label of K-pop powerhouse S.M. Entertainment, finally revealed its first girl group, Billlie, on Wednesday. The six-piece act -- comprising four South Korean members, Moon Sua, Suhyeon, Haram and Siyoon, and two members from Japan, Tsuki and Haruna -- have landed in the K-pop scene with their first EP “The Billage of Perception : Chapter One.” Ahead of their album release, the group conducted a debut showcase in Seoul, which was live-streamed as a pandemic precaution. Their name combines the English name Billie with an extra “l.” They said the regular name Billie reflected their “B-sides” -- the inner-self that everyone has inside them. They hope to empathize with people by expressing their “B-sides,” while adding a twist -- like the extra letter -- to create some thing special. “We want to make music that could warmly touch people‘s hearts,” Moon Sua said. Moon is the younger sister of Astro member Moonbin. Leading their EP is “Ring X Ring,” which tells a mysterious story surrounding a fictional village. According to the members, the song marks the start to an upcoming story universe, expressing a dilemma on whether to accept the given situation or to take a daring step to make a change. The group garnered much attention ahead of their debut as the first girl group assembled at the hands of South Korea’s star singer-songwriter and producer Yoon Jong-shin. The members originally belonged to the pre-debut group called Mystic Rookies, which consists of versatile artists nurtured through the label’s “Mystic Incubation Camp” training system. According to member Si-yoon, Yoon had advised them to “never forget the mind and the passion we hold right now as we start and to keep on trying hard and to enjoy every stage.” Billlie’s debut also comes with high anticipations as their title song “Ring X Ring” is backed by some of the biggest names in the entertainment industry, including lyricist Kim Eana, composer Lee Min-su and music video director Hwang Su-ah. While the three artists all have their own extensive careers, they have together created numerous K-pop hits, including IU’s “Good Day” and “The Red Shoes” and Brown Eyed Girls’ “Abracadabra” and “Candy Man.” Proudly presenting themselves as a group strong in dance and performance, Billlie also caught the public eye with their collaboration with star choreographer Lia Kim, who leads One Million Dance Studio. Kim, who has created dances for some of the most popular K-pop musicians, including Twice, Mamamoo, BoA and Sunmi, contributed to the choreography of “Ring X Ring.” Their six-track album also includes “Flipp!ng a Coin,” “Flowerld,” “The Eleventh Day,” “Everybody’s Got a $ECRET” and “The Rumor,” which will illustrate the versatile talents of each of the members, the group said. The girls voiced some daring ambitions they had with their debut. Haruna hoped to win the rookie of the year at music awards with their debut EP, while Tsuki wanted nicknames such “an all-rounder group” and “chart-topper” to follow their name. Meanwhile, the K-pop scene is seeing a flush of new girl groups recently, including StayC, Purple Kiss, Tri.Be and bugAboo, not to mention those set to debut, such as Starship Entertainment’s IVE, also set for launch in December. Asked how they differentiate themselves from other rookie groups, Haram answered, “Strong teamwork. The synergy of six distinctive members will be special.” Suhyeon piped in, “You cannot miss our performances. We’ve released several performance videos ahead of our debut, so please look forward to what we have to show with our title song.” By Choi Ji-won ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2021/11/10/20211110000780_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
"S. Korea, Sweden to hold forum on joint responses to illegal fishing",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2707984,2021.10.18 11:16,"Around 100 South Korean and Swedish maritime officials and experts will gather this week for a forum to explore ways to curb illegal fishing, South Korea's oceans ministry said Monday. During the four-day forum set to kick off Tuesday, officials from the governments and major international organizations, such as the International Maritime Organization and the Food and Agricultural Organization, and maritime experts will discuss ways to better implement international agreements on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and to cooperate among related entities against such threats. The forum was organized jointly by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries and the World Maritime University in Sweden in accordance with the memorandum of understanding the two sides clinched in June with a goal to boost their cooperation in dealing with illegal fishing, according to the ministry. Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is one of the major threats to marine ecosystems due to its potent ability to undermine national and regional efforts to manage fisheries in a sustainable manner, as well as efforts to conserve marine biodiversity, experts said.

"Phase II Data Of Medigen COVID-19 Vaccine, Reviewed And Published In The Lancet Respiratory Medicine",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2707556,2021.10.15 20:00,"TAIPEI, Oct. 15, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, one of the world's best-known peer-reviewed medical journals has published Medigen Vaccine Biologics (MVC) data from its MVC-COV1901 vaccine phase 2 clinical trial which demonstrates promising immunogenicity and safety profiles. The internationally trusted source of clinical, public and global health knowledge has made available the results from a large-scale, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial done at eleven sites in Taiwan, making MVC visible to a global network of researchers, clinicians, industry leaders and other professionals in the field. The study, which was carried out between Dec 30, 2020, and April 2, 2021, saw 3854 individuals screened and randomly assigned (6:1) to the MVC-COV1901 group, or the placebo group. Eligible participants were healthy adults aged 20 years or older. Participants were administered intramuscularly two doses of either MVC-COV1901 or placebo 28 days apart. The featured results stated that the seroconversion rate, based on the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 GMT, in the MVC-COV1901 group on day 57 was 99·8%. In both younger and older adults who received the MVC-COV1901 vaccine, almost all participants had seroconversion in younger adults and 99·5% in older adults. The design of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen used in the MVC-COV1901 vaccine was licensed from the U.S. NIH, which involves a range of molecular modifications to the S-2P pre-fusion spike protein. The combination of CpG 1018 and aluminium hydroxide with this S-2P pre-fusion spike protein shows promising elicitation of both T-cell and B-cell immunity. One of the most distinct findings in the safety profile is the extremely low incidence of fever. In conclusion, the interim analysis showed that the MVC-COV1901 vaccine has a good safety profile and elicits promising neutralising antibody titres. Compared with other vaccines that have received emergency use authorisation, MVC-COV1901 is safe, well tolerated, and rarely causes febrile reactions in both young and older adults. MVC-COV1901 induces high neutralising antibody and anti-spike IgG titres, and it has a seroconversion rate of almost 100% by day 57. Using WHO IU and BAU conversion models, both methods utilized in the paper provide a predictive efficacy ranging between 80% to 90%. The results from the study served as the basis for immunobriding that gives the MVC-COV1901 vaccine's Emergency Use Authorization in Taiwan and can support the advancement in subsequent developments. About Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corp. (MVC) MVC is a biopharmaceutical company using cell-based technologies to develop novel vaccines and biosimilars. With a goal of national self-sufficiency, MVC also aims to provide vaccines and biopharmaceuticals to meet regional needs and with a desire to help globally against the threats of infectious diseases.

Hanbok-clad Chinese game characters spark controversy,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2698617,2021.09.30 19:47,"A Chinese game featuring a female character dressed in traditional Korean costume hanbok has sparked controversy over plagiarism and intellectual property theft in South Korea. According to industry sources Thursday, Blooming Moonlight, a game serviced in Korea by Chinese game developer Zishi Technology, showcases a character wearing a hanbok outfit with the exact same design as that of Baekoaksoo, a renowned Seoul-based hanbok company, which previously designed the outfits featured in the music video for BTS member Suga’s single “Daechwita,” released last year. Cho Jin-woo, chief executive of Baekoaksoo, expressed concerns, saying that it was more than just a simple case of intellectual property theft. “Hanbok is the national attire infused with the identity of the Korean people, and using it without permission is equivalent to stealing our unique spirit,” Cho said. “I hope the Chinese game company apologizes with utmost sincerity.” Aircap, a Korean game company which has exclusive rights to use Baekoaksoo’s hanbok design inside games, also denounced the Chinese game developer. According to Aircap, the stolen hanbok costume is one of the reward items given to users in the early stages of Girl Globe, the firm’s mobile dress up game. The Chinese developer copied the costume and simply changed the item’s name to “Lake Fog” from the original “Purple Scent.” “Every detail of the costume has been plagiarized, even the flowers actually used in the photo shoot (of Baekoaksoo),” Han Ji-min, chief executive of Aircap, said. “Though we asked the Chinese game company to make corrections, we haven’t heard back. If we don’t straighten this out, there will be another case like this. We will take actions based on legal consultations,” Han said. Recently, Chinese games have made several attempts to dress their characters in hanbok, which infuriated Korean users who see it as an attempt by China to steal Korea’s cultural heritage. In April, a Chinese mobile game Call Me an Emperor was embroiled in controversy for dressing a female character in a hanbok dress that was worn by Korean singer-songwriter and actress IU in the drama series “Moon Lovers.” Last November, Chinese gaming firm Paper Games’ Shining Nikki shut down its Korean server just two months after controversy erupted over clothing items featured in the game that resembled hanbok.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2021/09/30/20210930000831_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

But the number of private academies that offer dance and vocal lessons has mushroomed as more youngsters aspire to K-pop stardom. Private training systems Lee Jae-won has run a dance academy in Apgujeong-dong, southern Seoul, for eight years, training young idol-wannabes. Lee’s institution systematically instructs trainees with the goal of eventually getting them into big agencies so they can debut as entertainers. “There are many academies that welcome adults and teenagers, and some even offer classes that focus on auditions, but there are barely any institutes that teach basic skills to young kids,” he said. The institute offers dance courses at the introductory, intermediate and advanced levels. Beginners learn the basics, such as how to use their bodies and do easy dance moves to K-pop music. At the next level they learn more complicated choreography and try out genres like hip-hop and popping. In South Korea, the average age of a debuting singer is getting younger, and some K-pop powerhouses set age limits for auditions. Lee said this is why he provides thorough training -- because idol hopefuls cannot survive the big agencies’ wide trainee pools without the basics. Lee offers separate classes for boys and girls because male and female trainees need to learn different dance styles. The academy also organizes lessons based on age -- there are classes for grades one to three, grades three to six and middle schoolers, as abilities vary. While talking about trainees from the academy who got into big-name agencies, Lee fondly recalled one excellent student who is now with Big Hit. “(The kid) had numerous charms and had many talents tailored to him. But his parents didn’t want to see their son onstage. Fortunately, he got into Big Hit two years ago as one of the youngest trainees and aces every end-of-the-month evaluation.” Lee added that apart from gaining the necessary skills, idol hopefuls should know how to be modest and diligent because becoming an A-lister in the music scene isn’t a walk in the park. Wishing to be the next K-pop sensation “I am a versatile idol-wannabe with a pretty face.” Woo Seo-yul dreams of becoming the next IU, a K-pop superstar. The 8-year-old, who lives in the southwestern Seoul district of Geumcheon, wakes up at 7:30 a.m. for school, attends her elementary school classes from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m. and then heads out the door for practice. This scene is peculiar in a nation where academic subjects decide one’s future. But now the name of the game is working to become the next global sensation. “The industry has been flooding with audition programs that have been aired on the nation’s network channels and other streaming platforms,” said pop culture critic Kim Hern-sik. He added that K-pop gurus such as Park Jin-young of JYP Entertainment and Lee Soo-man of S.M. Entertainment appear on the show and engage in the scouting process in some cases as well. He went on to say that in addition to their talent and skills, idol bands are revered because of their wealth and privilege, which is why idol-wannabes hope to be the talk of the town like BTS. Lee Sun-kyoung, Seo-yul’s mother, said she never pictured herself as the parent of an idol hopeful. But now she drives more than an hour to drop her daughter off at a kids’ dance academy in the Gangnam district twice a week. “It’s heartbreaking seeing my daughter want to become an idol because everybody wants to be one. My daughter only sings and dances, apart from going to school,” Lee said. She added that the tuition was a burden as well. But Lee thinks her daughter’s efforts will eventually pay off. “I’m aware that the road to a debut is not easy, which is why I’m constantly supporting my daughter. But even if she doesn’t become one, hopefully my daughter will be able to showcase her talent as a dancer or a dance teacher.” Big dreams, out of reach Led by boy band BTS’ meteoric rise to stardom over the past few years, more and more K-pop figures have gained immense popularity around the globe among people of all ages. But that kind of fame is hard to attain. Lesser-known musical artists often confront difficulties in the music scene. One 27-year-old woman, surnamed Park, was always a would-be K-pop idol in her mind’s eye. As a child in the US, she was always fascinated with K-pop, although she never thought she would pursue it as a profession. But at the end of her senior year of high school, she hopped on a plane to Korea after passing an audition for the second season of the survival television program “K-Pop Star,” which aired on terrestrial network SBS in November 2012. After attending 10 auditions in Korea, she got accepted to an agency and finally made her debut. But the experience ultimately ended in disappointment. “Being in a smaller company has more cons than pros. From the way how staff members of high-ranked broadcasting people treat you, and how you don’t get preferential treatment, unlike other bands who entertainment giants house,” Park said. “The bigger your company, the better you get treated.” Favoritism toward big companies affects which shows performers get booked on, she said, as well as screen time, waiting rooms and whether they can make a living. “Companies invest in trainees, and it takes at least one to three years to pay off until the point when the group starts making money,” she said. But Park ended up with more debt than money because she wasn’t given the opportunity to promote herself, which was one of the main reasons she decided not to continue her K-pop career. “Doing what you love and making money sounds almost too good to be true,” Park said. “But when you start to see how hard it is to do so, and not being able to achieve in one to four years, you start to lose the real you. At times, you have got to be a little more realistic, although it means not being able to pursue your dreams.”",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2021/09/23/20210923000093_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

"K-Culture Festival to be held in November, headed by producer Kim Hyung-suk",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2688914,2021.09.14 16:08,"Music producer and composer Kim Hyung-suk was named the executive producer of the K-Culture Festival, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism said Monday. The K-Culture Festival kicks off Nov. 13-14 at the country’s largest convention center, Kintex, northwest of Seoul in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province. The K-Culture Festival is the leading global festival connecting Korean culture with the world, further expanding Hallyu, or the Korean Wave. The two-day festival aims to encourage visitors to experience various aspects of Korean culture, including food, beauty, drama, fashion and K-pop. Having started his musical career by writing Korean folk rock legend Kim Kwang-seok’s “In the Name of Love,” Kim Hyung-suk cemented his legacy by producing top Korean singers including Lee Moon-sae, JYP, Sung Si-kyung and IU. The producer was widely recognized for his role as the music director of a cultural festival celebrating the 25th anniversary of South Korea and China diplomatic ties and “Evergreen Tree 2020,” a remake of the iconic song to mark the 60th anniversary of the April Revolution that led to the resignation of South Korea’s first president in 1960. Kim recently directed a campaign song for the P4G Seoul Summit held in May. This year’s festival centers around K-pop, providing a platform for fans around the world to connect with their favorite artists. The ministry said it seeks to expand the event into an international music festival involving award ceremonies and global conferences starting next year.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2021/09/14/20210914000556_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
"Impact of China’s crackdown on K-pop fandom limited as agencies diversify markets, business models",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2685650,2021.09.08 18:23,"China moves to restrict K-pop fans’ star-chasing activities, as shown in suspension of BTS fan account On Saturday, photos of a Jeju Air airplane featuring BTS’ Jimin on its exterior circulated on Weibo as part of a BTS fan club’s campaign to celebrate the K-pop star’s 26th birthday. K-pop fan clubs often celebrate the birthdays of their stars by buying advertisements in newspapers, on public transport or on subway billboards. But the photos sparked serious backlash in China, and Weibo banned the fan club-run social media account with over 1.1 million followers from posting for two months over what it called “illegal fundraising.” Weibo imposed the ban not only on the BTS fan club but also on other fan accounts devoted to well-known K-pop stars, including NCT, EXO, Blackpink and IU, pledging to stop “irrational star-chasing behavior.” The sudden clampdown on South Korean pop culture came after Chinese President Xi Jinping led a campaign to strengthen control over a range of sectors, including online gaming, private education and cultural content, including K-pop music. It was not the first time Chinese authorities put restrictions on the distribution of Korean content, but the latest move, given its scale and nature, appears worrying enough to prompt Korean media and brokerages to analyze the repercussions. Major Korean newspapers and TV stations reported Weibo’s ban on the K-pop fan accounts, saying the crackdown followed an announcement from the Chinese authorities last month about tougher measures to control the so-called “fandom culture.” Under the new guidelines, Chinese regulators are preventing youngsters from spending money to support their idols while banning online lists that rank celebrities’ popularity -- part of a drive to “clean up” fandom culture. A number of critical comments were posted on Korea’s major portal news sites criticizing China’s “excessive” control of the entertainment industry. “It is time for local entertainment agencies to forget about the Chinese market,” a user on Naver News said. Another user commented that the fan club operators should not be blamed as BTS fans were celebrating voluntarily. Impact on Korea’s entertainment industry A Korean brokerage said in a report on Tuesday that China’s latest crackdown on Korean celebrities and fandom culture was unlikely to have a critical impact on the domestic K-pop industry in the long term. China has been keeping tight control of imports of Korean cultural content and other products ranging from cosmetics to water purifiers since 2016 over the deployment of the THAAD missile defense system. Mirae Asset Securities in Seoul said the related shares dropped by 9 percent from their recent highs, but the impact is likely to be limited, largely because Korean entertainment companies have already cut down on their dependence on and trust in the Chinese market, which is fraught with complex regulations. Since the beginning of this year, the four major entertainment agencies have witnessed a rise in share prices, following an uptrend in the broader market. In the year to date, shares of Hybe, the company behind BTS, rose 95 percent and S.M. Entertainment shares climbed 124.1 percent. During the same period, shares of YG Entertainment and JYP Entertainment went up 30.7 percent and 8.3 percent, respectively. “Profits of entertainment agencies are unlikely to be seriously affected by the Chinese clampdown on K-pop fandom,” said Jay Park, an analyst at Mirae Asset Securities. “The revenue of album sales in China account for 0.6 percent to 2.0 percent for Korea’s four major agencies.” The sharp rise of K-pop album sales outside of Korea is largely led by the US and other countries across the world, with China lagging far behind. One of the reasons for downplaying the Chinese impact is that Korean agencies are diversifying their business models to include merchandise sales, online concerts and digital music releases, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic reshaped the entertainment industry in general. In addition, top-ranked stars and groups with the four agencies -- Lisa of Blackpink, aespa, Twice, Stray Kids and others -- are scheduled to release new music starting in September. New, next-generation groups are also readying to foray into the competition, which is expected to nurture their own fan groups in a way that bolsters the artist portfolios of the agencies going forward. K-pop going through transformation Since 2000, Korea’s K-pop industry has undergone a series of dramatic transformations. S.M. Entertainment and YG Entertainment spearheaded entry into the Japanese market and proved the value of their marketing strategy by focusing on Japan’s unique idol fandom culture. In the years that followed, agencies rode the YouTube bandwagon and digital music platforms to reach out to fans across the globe. As demonstrated by the success of BTS, Blackpink and Twice, agencies with artists supported by global fandoms came to solidify their market positions, and share prices reflected this. Last year, entertainment agencies hit a major challenge with the coronavirus, which made it impossible to run offline concerts and other events such as fan meetings, disrupting the conventional marketing strategy and business model. Hybe, which rapidly drew talent from diverse sectors, built its own digital subscription platform for BTS, while entering new business categories such as gaming tailored for BTS fans and strengthening the merchandise business. Due to the proliferation of contactless culture, Hybe organized online concerts on a large scale. It is estimated that online concerts during the COVID-19 period sold 200,000 to 800,000 tickets. Since there is no limit to the number of online viewers and agencies have also linked the events to merchandise sales, their profits tend to stay at a high level. Other agencies are following suit by developing their own platforms, and by diversifying income structures and target markets. As far as global platforms are concerned, the agencies continue to use YouTube and Spotify to publicize their artists and distribute digital content for the global market. In the process, for Korean entertainment firms, China has been put on the back burner in terms of marketing and sales, as the neighboring country has kept tight control over the distribution of Korean content in recent years. The Chinese government’s crackdown on fandom culture is not limited to Korean stars. Popular Chinese celebrities such as Fan Bingbing, Zheng Shuang and Zhao Wei have also suffered setbacks after being dealt heavy fines or having their film credits removed, reflecting the deepening anti-celebrity policies in China.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2021/09/08/20210908000782_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
EPEX: A high-profile rookie band ready to make a splash,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2663019,2021.07.30 18:03,"In the highly competitive K-pop scene, it’s hard for rookies to rise above the crowd and make a splash. Despite the global lockdown during the ongoing pandemic era, EPEX is off to a good start. Hailed as a super-rookie band, the eight-piece group under C9 Entertainment released its first EP, “Bipolar Pt. 1: Prelude of Anxiety,” June 8 and achieved the highest first-week sales for a debut album among newcomers this year: a total of 33,353 copies sold on the Hanteo chart. With its name meaning “the gathering of eight youths reaches eight different apexes,” EPEX consists of Keum, Wish, Mu, A-Min, Baek Seung, Ayden, Yewang and Jeff. Except for the eldest member, Wish, all the bandmates are teenagers who’ve been juggling training and school for years. “When I was a trainee, I couldn’t picture myself as an idol, couldn’t imagine it honestly. Each day was full of uncertainty. Mu and I used to go home together after practice, worrying about whether we would be able to make our debut or not. And I’m really glad that we’ve made it this far together,” said Wish during a recent interview with The Korea Herald in Seoul. Looking back on his pre-debut days, Mu chimed in and said, “After we’ve finally made our debut after all those doubts and worries, I wanted to go further. It’s as if we’ve entered a different dimension. It was eye-opening.” As teenagers, the bandmates have a naturally endearing and effervescent energy. But their music offers something different, something special that attracts fans. Anchored in the hip-hop genre, “Bipolar Pt. 1: Prelude of Anxiety” deals with the worries of the younger generation, such as angst about falling prey to society’s expectations. Although the band identifies itself as a dance group, the five-track EP spans various genres such as electro-trap, Latin and R&B. Opener “Go Big” expresses the band’s desire to reach the apex, while lead track “Lock Down” and “Cyanide” touch upon the negative effects of social media and the way rumors become “facts.” “No Questions” and “Sling Shot” bring the generational theme to a higher level, questioning the narrator’s life path and the line between freedom and suppression. The musicians shared that they’d drawn on their own experiences and thoughts in the creative process, making the songs more relatable. They’d had long conversations with the lyricists when making the album, they explained, wanting to convey the millennial-oriented message. “All five songs reflect our own stories, an outcome of our actual daily conversations and contemplations. The song I relate to most is ‘No Questions,’ which encourages youth to go their own way rather than following what our elders tell us to do. I once told our lyricist that I wanted to follow my own dream without caring what others thought of me,” said Baek Seung. Wish, whose favorite track from the album is also “No Question,” added that the song’s message was one that had inspired him throughout his teenage years. As the band’s name suggests, EPEX is brimming with ambition. At the same time, the musicians are putting in an equal effort to foster tight relationships within the group. They said they enjoyed discussing various issues, and that talking helped them understand each other despite their different backgrounds and personalities. Keum said he’d recently been contemplating EPEX’s career path both musically and in terms of concepts. Surprisingly, the young musicians all have different musical tastes. Keum said he’d been listening to Jung Seung-hwan’s “The Snowman” recently, while Yewang is a ballad lover. “It’s funny that we are a dance group, but when I’m all by myself, I crave ballads,” he said. A-Min said his favorite track was IU’s “Secret Garden,” and Ayden expressed his passion for hip-hop. The rookies also went on to talk about the history of K-pop, sharing the monumental moments they would like to relive. “We are more than thankful for giving us such love. Our next goal is to win first place on music programs and return with new music that can capture listeners’ ears and hearts. Please look forward to our next step,” said Wish.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2021/07/30/20210730000647_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
South Korea’s tidal flats inscribed as UNESCO world heritage,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2659003,2021.07.27 16:52,"The CHA plans to submit additional list of tidal flats for UNESCO review in 2025 South Korea’s “gaetbeol,” or Korean tidal flats, were inscribed onto UNESCO’s world heritage list on Monday. The final decision on the tidal flats’ listing was made during the 44th session of the World Heritage Committee which took place in Fuzhou, China. The meeting was held online due to the global pandemic. A total of four tidal flats across the country’s coastal areas -- Seocheon in South Chungcheong Province, Gochang in North Jeolla Province, Sinan, Boseong and Suncheon in South Jeolla Province -- were acknowledged by the committee. With the listing, South Korea now has 15 inscribed UNESCO world heritage sites. The tidal flats are the country’s second inscribed natural heritage after Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava Tubes. “As the head of the national heritage agency for the Republic of Korea, I am beyond delighted to see our gaetbeol nomination being successfully inscribed on the world heritage list,” Kim Hyun-mo, head of the Cultural Heritage Administration said. “The gaetbeol is an internationally critical natural habitat that sustains an extremely diverse range of species.” Kim added that the CHA is fully committed to cooperating closely with all relevant stakeholders to support the conservation of gaetbeol. According to the CHA, the UNESCO committee members recognized the outstanding universal value of gaetbeol, since it is one of the world’s most important stopover sites for migratory birds. This listing was unexpected as the International Union for Conservation of Nature, an advisory body for UNESCO, in May said that after a preliminary review, it decided to hand down a deferral in a four-tier system -- consisting of inscribe, refer, defer and not to inscribe. The IUCN, at the time, explained that while there is a possibility that gaetbeol serves as an important habitat for biodiversity, the range of the areas is not large enough to show a large-scale topographic and ecological process, with the exception of the tidal flats in Sinan. After the listing announcement, the World Heritage Committee on Monday also recommended South Korea to submit an additional list of tidal flats before its 48th session which will be held in 2025. It also asked South Korea to prepare an integrated management system for tidal flats and strengthen its cooperation with the international community to protect endangered migratory birds. In response, the CHA promised to follow the recommendations. “We will talk in detail with local governments for the additional list of tidal flats,” CHA’s World Heritage Division Director Yeo Sung-hee told The Korea Herald on Tuesday. “The most difficult part when applying for inscription as a UNESCO world heritage is that its value has to be recognized. Since we have proven its value, we don’t have to go through that process again. Also we will have to work on creating an integrated management system.” Yeo added that it will work with related bodies, including the Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries and local governments, on the system. The East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership (EAAFP) which has been supporting the South Korean tidal flats’ UNESCO inscription said it will further cooperate with the CHA. The EAAFP is a network of 18 partners within the East Asian-Australasian Flyway and mainly aims to protect migratory waterbirds and their habitats. Its partners include countries such as Australia, Indonesia, Japan and the Philippines. “We supported gaetbeol’s listing because it is a crucial place that migrating birds rest. If this (area) disappears, it will be impossible for the birds to migrate,” EAAFP Program Officer Do Hye-seon said. She added that it is more important to establish measures to protect the sites than being listed as a UNESCO world heritage itself. “We will provide consulting when the South Korean government asks for it. Also since the additional gaetbeol list should be created based on migratory bird habitats, we plan to connect South Korean government with necessary external advisory bodies from abroad,” she said.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2021/07/27/20210727000695_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
S. Korean tidal flats listed as UNESCO world heritage,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2660466,2021.07.26 19:53,"South Korea's tidal flats have been officially inscribed as a UNESCO world natural heritage despite receiving a deferral in a preliminary review, cultural heritage authorities said Monday. Seoul has been pushing to register ""getbol,"" or ""Korean tidal flats,"" on UNESCO's world heritage list in the 44th session of the World Heritage Committee taking place in Fuzhou, China, online. The decision came as a surprise, considering that getbol was deferred from the list of potential assets that could be listed as UNESCO world heritage in a preliminary review held in May. The list consists of cultural, natural and mixed sites. The International Union for Conservation of Nature, an advisory body for UNESCO, handed down a deferral for getbol in a four-tier system consisting of inscribe, refer, defer and not to inscribe. While an ""inscribe"" recommendation raises the possibility of the heritage being listed on the UNESCO list, those that have received a ""not to inscribe"" recommendation cannot reapply for review. The IUCN suggested that while there is a possibility that getbol serves as an important habitat for biodiversity, the range of the areas is not large enough to show a large-scale topographic and ecological process, with the exception of the tidal flats in Sinan. South Korea had applied for a review on four tidal flats across the country's coastal areas, such as Seocheon in South Chungcheong Province, and Gochang, Sinan, Boseong and Suncheon in South and North Jeolla Provinces. With the inscription, South Korea has 15 sites listed on the world heritage list.

AKMU helps to take leap through new collaboration album,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2660366,2021.07.26 17:35,"Sibling duo AKMU is ready to take the music scene by storm. The duet is opening a new chapter in their music career with new collaboration album “Next Episode,” releasing Monday evening. The seven-song package provides support and comfort to people when they hit rock bottom in their lives, brother and songwriter Lee Chan-hyuk and sister Lee Su-Hyun said during an online press conference. Fronted by lead track “Fall,” featuring singer and actress IU, the latest print for the group is a collaboration album brimming with the voices of A-listers, including veteran singer Lee Sun-hee, rapper Beenzino, Crush, Sam Kim, Zion.T and Choi Jung-hoon of indie rock band Jannabi, and is the first of its kind. It took years for the duo to team up with IU, making a dream come true for fans who had yearned for such a collaboration between the two. Su-hyun said she came together with the singer-songwriter because AKMU was looking for an artist who could “efficiently deliver the message of ‘Fall’ to the public” and that IU was a perfect match to the song. “She is popular and able to persuade anyone,” Su-hyun said, adding their work with IU became the start of the whole collaboration album. The sister-brother tandem said their main song was inspired by the movie “The Greatest Showman.” Chan-hyuk added that the word “fall” could be interpreted as a dark term, but he aims to send out positivity. “The song sends a positive message of inclusion, just like the film. We wanted to convey a hopeful message that ‘however deep down you fall, if you’re beside me holding my hand, nothing will matter,” Chan-hyuk said. Speaking about the music video to be released later, Chan-hyuk talked about how he falls endlessly. “If you get to see the clip, I continuously tumble down until the point where I hold Su-hyun’s hands. There’s a little tweak in this part. The screen is flipped upside down at this point to make it seem as if we’re soaring up in the sky, rather than falling.” He added that those who grasp the message of the song would be able to picture the duality of this particular scene. Chan-hyuk said the star-studded album centers around one common idea -- transcendent freedom, a term newly coined by the two. If their 2019 album’s “Freedom” explains freedom by “wanting to walk without clothes,” the pair tried to show a more buoyant mood in the latest album. The singer described the meaning behind transcendent freedom as an “extraordinary power that goes beyond people’s physical limits, allowing people to unplug from any external influence.” Chan-hyuk added that he aims to bring out a message not to be swayed even if one descends. When asked about what they wish to achieve through “Next Episode,” the chart-topping duo said they had set their hearts set on offering succor to those who are ready to make a leap of faith. “I started my music journey with the bold ambition to change the world with our music. But I realized that changing everyone is not the destination we are heading to,” Chan-hyuk said. He believes that the beauty of the world lies in diversity and wishes to encourage those set for a new change. From releasing an album with all jointly recorded songs to listing his name as a co-composer for Chan-hyuk, the duo also said they made several leaps of faith through the collaboration album. “It was the first time producing an album filled with other singers,” the two said together. The pair likened teaming up with seven artists to the Avengers, adding that they are beyond grateful to pair up their voices with the nation’s leading singers. A special space allowing music lovers to delve into transcendental freedom will also be available at Beaker’s flagship store in Yongsan, central Seoul, starting Tuesday until Aug. 8. The relaxing yet heartening seven-track collaboration album is set to release at 6 p.m.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2021/07/26/20210726000701_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
"P4G Seoul Summit unites world leaders for inclusive green recovery, serves as stepping stone for next climate COP",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2630108,2021.06.09 17:40,"P4G Seoul Summit wraps up on May 31, proclaiming global inclusive green growth in Seoul Declaration Summit calls for global cooperation in climate change response; developed countries announce support for carbon neutrality; developing countries to accelerate green growth Summit enhances innovative private-public cooperation in major five areas, contributes to climate change response and proliferation of new green paradigm SEOUL, South Korea, June 9, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The 2021 P4G Seoul Summit wrapped up its two-day meeting on May 31 with world leaders affirming their commitment to an inclusive green recovery and carbon neutrality. During the first multilateral climate summit hosted by the Republic of Korea, leaders from developed and developing countries discussed measures to respond to climate change and reaffirmed the expansion of support for green growth in developing countries and their commitment to the goal of the Paris Agreement (to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050). Major countries such as the U.S., U.K. and Germany expressed their determination to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their countries and the world, and support sustainable growth in developing countries. During the Leader's Dialogue on May 31, U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry noted that to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, three things need to be accomplished -- an end to carbon-intensive fossil fuel use, the dissemination of clean energy technologies, and major investments in such technologies. He said the U.S. will double its public climate financing to developing countries by 2024. During the Leader's Session on May 30, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that no government can achieve a green industrial revolution alone and that international cooperation is imperative to create massive funds for climate response. He added that the U.K. will support the transition to a green economy through R&D investment and technology development. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Germany is making efforts to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045 and promised to faithfully fulfill its commitment to the international climate fund. Leaders and top-level officials from Bangladesh, Vietnam and other countries said they will accelerate green growth and actively participate in global efforts for carbon neutrality. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh said the country adopted a 100-year sustainable development plan called Delta Plan 2100. She added that Bangladesh focuses on upholding the interests of countries vulnerable to climate change and promoting regional adaptation solutions. Vietnamese Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính emphasized the need to strengthen capacity and improve conditions to respond to climate problems. He also expressed Vietnam's willingness to cooperate for an inclusive green recovery, calling for a more harmonious approach in which developed countries continue to take the lead in mitigating emissions and all stakeholders participate in such efforts. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang commented that for sustainable green development, international cooperation is essential, especially support to resolve difficulties faced by developing nations. China will contribute to a low-carbon, green recovery through its pledge to go carbon neutral by 2060 and organizing the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP15) of the U.N. Conference of Biological Diversity, he added. The Seoul Declaration, adopted as the result of the P4G Seoul Summit, manifested the solidarity and resolve of the participant countries. The Declaration pronounces their commitment to overcome the COVID-19 crisis through a green recovery, limit the increase of the Earth's temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius, accelerate an energy transition away from fossil fuels, address marine plastics issues, and achieve Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. The Declaration was endorsed by 38 participant countries, including Korea, the U.S., Japan and China, and by nine international organizations including the World Economic Forum (WEF), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), and the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI). Angel Gurria, Secretary-General of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), and Bruno Oberle, Director-General of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), also expressed their support for the Declaration in their private capacities. President Moon Jae-in expressed his appreciation for the leaders in Twitter posts on June 3, after the close of the summit. In his tweet to U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, Moon said, ""We welcome the return of American leadership in responding to climate change. 'Getting to net zero by 2050 is an incredible economic opportunity.' I agree with your remark and look forward to strengthened collaboration between Korea and the U.S. in our fight against climate change."" In a tweet to Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), he said, ""The three points you highlighted have enriched our discussion session,"" referring to her remarks that a successful green transformation requires the world to embrace carbon pricing, green public investments and a just transition for the most affected. The P4G Seoul Summit enhanced public-private collaboration with the participation of leaders and representatives of scores of nations, international organizations, companies and civil society groups. In Korea, the P4G Seoul Summit Preparatory Office organized various events for climate change response and sustainable growth, in collaboration with 23 companies, public institutions and non-governmental organizations including IKEA Korea, Jeju Province Development Co., SK Telecom, Samsung Electronics, Hyosung T&C, Coupang, Pulmuone, Pleatsmama, Tree Planet, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Daelim Museum. Yoo Yeon-cheol, the Executive Director of the P4G Seoul Summit Preparatory Office said, ""The summit is very meaningful for climate change response in that developing and developed nations got together to discuss their plans for green cooperation and express their commitment."" ""Through the summit, which is the first-ever multilateral climate summit to be hosted by Korea, Korea greatly contributed to climate change response and the dissemination of the new green paradigm. Also, this event will become an opportunity to go beyond climate change discussions centered around developed nations and drive an inclusive green growth that engages everyone,"" he added. 2021 P4G Summit Seoul (https://2021p4g-seoulsummit.kr) P4G (Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030) was launched in September 2017, led by Denmark, as a global initiative to accelerate the response to climate change and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through public-private partnerships. Of the 17 SDGs set out by the United Nations in 2015 with the aim of achieving them by 2030, P4G specifically targets five objectives related to climate change (food and agriculture, clean water, clean energy, sustainable cities and circular economy). Twelve countries – the Republic of Korea, Denmark, the Netherlands, Vietnam, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Kenya, Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Indonesia and South Africa – as well as international organizations (including the World Economic Forum and the Global Green Growth Institute) and private companies participate in the summit. P4G - is a consultation group consisting of governments, companies and civil society organizations, -puts an emphasis on action-oriented public-private cooperation, - is composed of middle-power countries (playing the role of a bridge between developing countries and developed countries) - seeks to build a sustainable business model (a bridge between development and investment).",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/news/cms/2021/06/09/20210609000989.300d783b-febf-4bdf-8a0a-b159c93a2c9d_T1.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Yili Reports Strong Progress on Biodiversity Protection and Sustainability at the Warm-up Event of the 2021 BBF,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2630437,2021.06.09 00:30,"KUNMING, China, June 8, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- On June 6, 2021, the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (SCBD) and China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment hosted the warm-up event of the 2021 Business and Biodiversity Forum (BBF) in Kunming, China, with the theme ""The business and finance journey to Kunming: We are part of the solution"". The event took place as part of the UN Conference on Biological Diversity, which aims to convene partnerships to share ideas and solutions. Yili Group, Asia's largest dairy producer, released its 2020 Annual Report on Biodiversity Conservation and 2020 Sustainability Report at the event. The company has been reporting upon its practices in both areas since 2018. Addressing climate change and achieving a ""carbon-neutral"" future Achieving ""carbon neutrality"" and ""peak carbon emissions"" have become key issues concerning humanity wellbeing. As of 2010, Yili has been working on carbon inventory for 11 consecutive years. In response to the UN 2030 SDGs, Yili has proposed solutions to the challenges of global climate change. In 2019, Yili successfully automated its carbon inventory by incorporating the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) Guidelines on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories into its own EHSQ management information system in accordance with ISO14064 Standards. Yili has reduced CO2 emissions by 6.51 million tons and saved electricity by 10.7 billion kwh over the pase 11 years. Protecting wildlife diversity through desert afforestation ""With its roots in Inner Mongolia, Yili is particularly concerned about the ecology of grassland"", said Su Yufeng, Yili's spokesperson. Due to the frequent droughts and overgrazing, Ar Horqin Banner in Inner Mongolia, faces the challenge of widespread grassland deterioration and desertification. To address this problem, Yili lauched an innovation herb cultivation model, that utilizes planting and husbandry practices. With annual production of more than 40,000 tons of high-quality medick and oat hay and saving 46,000 mu (1 mu ≈ 667 m2) of degraded grassland, the model produces quality coarse fodder for dairy cows while combating desertification and bringing important social and economic benefits to the local communities. This model helped to significantly increased vegetation coverage rate of key areas in Ar Horqin Banner's grassland from less than 10% in 2008 to more than 90% this year. Yili is dedicated to wetland protection and afforestation as well as wildlife habitats protection. In the company's wetland ecology monitoring project last year, 16,526 species of birds were recorded at 39 monitoring stations in three national nature reserves in Jilin Province. Among these recorded species are endangered birds such as the Oriental Stork, the Red-crowned Crane, and the Baer's Pochard, which has been described as ""rarer than the Giant Panda"" and is listed as critically endangered species by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature). Promoting organic lifestyles through environmentally-friendly packaging Yili has been a major advocate of organic and green lifestyles by promoting environmentally-friendly packaging. To protect forests inhabited by wildlife, Yili's Satine milk uses FSC-certified packaging. In 2020 alone, this program succeeded in converting 185,500 mu of sustainable forest into nearly five billion milk packages. Satine introduced organic lids partly made from sugarcane, a recyclable and renewable resource. In addition, Yili has established a life-cycle supply chain management system, inviting suppliers to build a responsible industry chain for a green future. By the end of 2020, 19 factories of Yili had been identified as ""Green Factories"" by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.

Singer IU buys W13b residence in Seoul in cash,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2626158,2021.06.02 14:51,"Singer and actress IU has purchased a high-end villa unit in Cheongdam-dong, a posh district in Seoul, for 13 billion won ($11.7 million) in cash, according to news reports Wednesday. The singer bought a residential unit of Eterno Cheongdam, currently under construction by Hyundai Engineering & Construction, according to local news outlet Biz.Hankook. The 20-story villa with four floors underground has one or two residential units on each floor starting from the second floor above ground. A 488-square-meter super penthouse of the riverside luxury villa, one of the highest-end residential properties in Seoul, is currently on sale for 30 billion won. The residence purchased by the K-pop star measures around 244 square meters. She is likely to complete her payment all in cash, as loans for a residential property valued at 1.5 billion won are completely banned in the city. As she bought the new residence, she also sold another real estate property recently. In May 2012, she bought a housing unit measuring 173.82 square meters in Bangbae for 840 million won, and she had her residence registered at the property. She sold it in June 2019 for 860 million won. The 28-year-old owns other real estate properties around Seoul as well. She purchased a commercial building for 4.6 billion won in Gwacheon, Gyeonggi Province, in February 2018 and a town house for 2.2 billion won in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province, in August 2018. She also owns 1,524 square meters of land, valued at some 800 million won. The K-pop star is believed to have received the green light from the district office to purchase the residential property. In affluent areas south of the Han River, purchasing residential properties requires permission from a district office, a measure to prevent speculative investment and cool down the overheated real estate market in Seoul.

Culture Ministry vows action on pirated K-pop songs,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2619245,2021.05.21 14:56,"The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism announced Friday that it would take action against Chinese music labels that infringed copyrights by uploading translated versions of K-pop songs on YouTube. There has been active discussion online about the practice of registering translated K-pop songs as original works by Chinese artists, without approval from the rightful copyright holders. IU’s “Tear Drops in the Morning,” Brown Eyes’ “Already One Year” and Younha’s “Waiting” are among the songs that have been rerecorded by Chinese singers and uploaded on YouTube by Chinese music labels without the appropriate permission. According to the Korea Music Copyright Association, the Chinese labels are violating the rights of the Korean performers. “This is frustrating as it is beyond imagination, but we will work this out,” K-pop singer Younha wrote on social media earlier this month. By doing this “you cannot touch someone’s heart or earn great money,” she said. The Culture Ministry, the Korea Music Copyright Association, the Federation of Korean Music Performers and the Recording Industry Association of Korea are looking into the matter after receiving reports from the copyright holders. The ministry said it would also call for cooperation from YouTube Korea and copyright offices abroad. The Korea Copyright Protection Agency said it would strengthen its monitoring of YouTube. “We will take action so that the copyrights cannot be infringed on YouTube through unapproved adaptation of songs,” an official from the Culture Ministry said. “Copyright holders who register information on YouTube have to actively claim their rights, too.” By Im Eun-byel ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2021/05/21/20210521000549_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

"K-pop songstress IU dominates music charts with new, old songs",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2590030,2021.04.05 13:21,"K-pop songstress IU has swept major music charts here with her latest album and past releases, landing more than 15 songs in the top 100 simultaneously. The 28-year-old soloist placed 16 songs in the top 100 on the latest daily music charts by streaming services Melon and Genie Music, refreshed Saturday, including all 10 tracks of her new album ""Lilac."" ""Lilac,"" the main track of her new studio album also titled ""Lilac,"" topped both charts, followed by the pre-released ""Celebrity"" at No. 3. ""Coin,"" ""Hi Spring Bye"" and ""Flu,"" all from her fifth studio album, claimed top 10 spots on both charts as well. ""Hold My Hand,"" the singer's first self-written song released in 2011, came in at No. 7 and No. 11 on the Melon and Genie Music charts, respectively. The high-profile 2020 collaboration between the K-pop queen and BTS' Suga, ""Eight,"" ranked No. 20 on the charts, almost one year after its release. On the Melon chart, even her 2014 spring number ""Not Spring, Love, or Cherry Blossoms"" ranked at 89th place. Pop culture experts say the dominance of a single musician's past and present hits on music charts is notable, even compared to popular K-pop boy and girl groups' success on music charts. Backed by fans' organized support, K-pop groups often put their songs on the top spots on real-time music charts, but the songs sometimes descend lower within days. IU, meanwhile, has kept her songs -- including those that date back several years -- on music charts for quite a long time. ""IU is almost the only singer whose album the public listens to entirely upon release and picks their favorites,"" music critic Jung Min-jae said. Listeners who are teenagers and in their 20s probably also played a big role in this phenomenon as they have grown up listening to IU's music for almost a decade, Jung added. The top soloist, who debuted in 2008, has reigned as one of the most successful singers here with self-produced megahit songs, such as ""Through the Night,"" ""Palette"" and ""Blueming.""

KBS apologizes for controversial questions given to Brave Girls,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2580431,2021.03.21 14:49,"Producers at broadcaster KBS apologized to fans on Friday for controversial questions asked to K-pop girl group Brave Girls in a YouTube video, but stopped short of apologizing to Brave Girls. The producers of the online program “Sketchbook Without You Heeyeol” uploaded a preview of the group before their appearance on “You Heeyeol’s Sketchbook” on Friday. In the video, the four members of Brave Girls read and answered a number of questions posted on Instagram. The questions had been selected by the producers. The questions included “When are you going to get married?” and “Do you think you are an ‘ajumma’ (middle-aged woman) now that you are almost 30.” Many viewers commented that the producers would never have allowed these questions to be asked of a top celebrity like IU, who is the same age as Yuna of Brave Girls. Following the criticism, KBS deleted the controversial questions in the video and posted an apology at the beginning of the video. “We sincerely apologize to everyone who felt uncomfortable watching the behind-the-scenes contents of Brave Girls,” said the producers. “We will pay closer attention in creating content. We once again apologize to those who support ‘Sketchbook Without You Heeyeol’ and Brave Girls.” However, no apology was offered to Brave Girls, further infuriating fans. “There was no need to say sorry to the viewers or Brave Girls’ fans. You should’ve said sorry to Brave Girls first. And even before that, you shouldn’t have chosen such questions. It’s 2021. Times have changed. Women can do whatever they want, whenever they want and regardless of their age.” said one comment. Meanwhile, Brave Girls reached the No. 1 spot on the music charts with their song “Rollin” after a YouTube video showing different responses by soldiers to the song that was released four years ago went viral last month.

Spotify secures IU’s music for K-pop listeners,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2573730,2021.03.11 15:32,"Kakao Entertainment and Spotify Technology on Thursday announced that it will make songs distributed by the Korean company available on the Swedish audio giant’s streaming platform across the globe, after a one-week suspension. The agreement will allow listeners overseas to resume enjoying songs by popular Korean artists, including IU and Zico, which were removed temporarily from the Spotify platform from the beginning of March. The platform operator at the time explained that the songs were not available because it failed to reach an agreement on renewing the licensing contract with Kakao Entertainment before it terminated. “We are pleased that Kakao Entertainment’s content and artists are back on Spotify, allowing our over 345 million global listeners across 170 countries to once again enjoy the music they love,” Spotify said in a statement. “We are delighted that our Korean listeners will now also be able to enjoy this local music alongside our over 70 million songs and more than 4 billion playlists.” “Through our diverse partnerships around the world including Spotify, we hope that music lovers around the world can easily access our artists and music,” Kakao Entertainment said in a statement. According to music industry sources, one of the key reasons why talks failed earlier was that the Korean company had been asking for separate licensing deals for the Korean market apart from the rest of the countries that Spotify operates in. The global streaming giant had reportedly refused to accept the offer. Securing popular Korean artists’ tracks, which are distributed by the Kakao affiliate, has been considered as one of the key factors required for Spotify’s expansion in the Korean market since it began its service in February. The Korean music distributor also runs Korea’s largest music streaming platform Melon, which enjoys a 37.5 percent local market share. Along with Korean platforms Genie and Flo, the trio together accounts for more than 80 percent of the market here. Now that the two companies have finally reached an agreement, Kakao Entertainment announced that it will gradually roll out its music content to Spotify for service in and outside of Korea from Friday. “Due to technical issues, we cannot start providing all the songs in different countries all at once,” a Kakao Entertainment spokesperson told The Korea Herald on Thursday.

"How girl group Brave Girls' 2017 song went viral in 2021 thanks to 'Millboard,' YouTube",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2571938,2021.03.10 14:47,"In today's world where social media is omnipresent, random things that fascinate people -- think viral cat videos, TikTok dance challenges, political conspiracies -- tend to go viral with the smallest triggers. For one K-pop girl group, this happened in an unexpected yet dramatic way. Brave Girls, a once-forgotten name in the competitive industry where so many acts come and go quickly, saw its 2017 song ""Rollin'"" soar to No. 1 on domestic music streaming charts -- four years after its release. The ascent was driven by the song's popularity on the so-called Millboard chart, a portmanteau of military and Billboard that refers to popular songs among the country's huge population of conscripted soldiers, and a YouTube channel that highlighted this popularity. In contrast to the fandom the four-piece act has established among its soldier fans, even getting the nickname ""president of the soldiers,"" the group and the 2017 track with a tropical house flair remained outside of the spotlight in the civilian world. However, things changed when a three-minute clip, showing the girl group performing at various concerts for the Army, the Marine Corps and even the Air Force, with reaction comments rolling across the subtitles, was uploaded on the YouTube channel Viditor in late February. ""Look how well soldiers taught this song to their juniors. This video was filmed in 2019 and they can still sing in unison,"" reads one comment, while another reads, ""This song made me survive through my military service."" By law, all able-bodied South Korean men must carry out military service for about two years. Some even joke how the song will contribute to peace between the two Koreas: ""North Korean soldiers would dance to this song too"" and ""The Koreas will be reunited LOL."" The song's newfound popularity has not been limited to YouTube. ""Rollin'"" -- which re-entered music streaming charts in late February -- has gone on to become the most-streamed song on streaming services Bugs and Genie Music. On Melon, the country's biggest streaming platform, it sits just after singer-songwriter IU's ""Celebrity"" released in January. Thanks to the fame that came after four years, the four-piece group is now getting ready to appear on music and variety TV shows, according to its management agency Brave Entertainment. The act's 2020 song ""We Ride"" has also gotten 1 million YouTube views as people searched for their other songs. Brave Girls, which has gone through ups and downs such as seeing a member leave in 2018, is in awe at how quickly and dramatically things have changed in a few days. The members -- Minyoung, Yujeong, Eunji and Yuna -- have left comments on the YouTube video, thanking fans for their support. ""We weren't able to perform as much due to the pandemic, thank you so much for the video,"" said Minyoung. ""We were all worn out with a change in group members and a hiatus, but all of us were energized."" Yujeong voiced how much the support has meant for the group members who have fought not to give up on their musical careers. ""It still feels weird if the attention is (for) us. When we made our comeback last year, one of the most memorable comments was 'Don't give up, thank you.' It's really flattering that so many people are still rooting for us."" Brave Girls is not the only K-pop girl group that saw its trajectory change by going viral. In 2014, girl group EXID, which was in its third year since its debut without much success, saw the song ""Up Down"" go viral thanks to a fan video of one of their performances. The group, which had wrapped up all activities related to the song, began appearing on TV music shows and went on to achieve the first No. 1 song of its career the following year.

Online K-pop forums and social media have been abuzz about the move, with artists, such as Epik High's Tablo, voicing complaints over the removal. ""Why is it always the artists and the fans that suffer when businesses place greed over art?"" the hip hop artist tweeted earlier this week. The conflict is the latest development since Spotify's turbulent landing in South Korea -- the sixth largest music market in the world -- early last month. Spotify landed in the country without securing a licensing agreement for the local market with then Kakao M, which holds 37.5 percent of the songs on the top 400 Gaon Music Chart of the Korea Music Content Association. The South Korean company has pointed the finger at Spotify for the recent removal of songs, saying the streaming giant simultaneously pursued deals for both the global and South Korean markets. Spotify said in a statement that it has tried to renew the global deal for a year and a half. ""It is our hope that this disruption will be temporary and we can resolve the situation soon,"" the company said in a statement. ""We remain committed to working with local rights holders including Kakao M, to help grow the Korean music market and overall streaming ecosystem together."" Talks for the local deal are also currently under way, according to company officials. Experts say the tussle over the licensing deal emerged as K-pop expanded its presence in the global music market. Spotify has been operating K-pop playlists since 2014 and the company said that the share of K-pop listening on its platform jumped by more than 2,000 percent, with total streaming time reaching 180 billion minutes. ""As K-pop becomes more popular, there's more profit to go around, leading to conflicting interests,"" said Lee Gyu-tag, a professor of cultural studies at George Mason University Korea. Kakao Entertainment's parent Kakao Corp. competes with Spotify through Melon, the country's largest music streaming service. Melon holds a tight grip over the country's music streaming market with nearly nine million monthly active users. But its user base pales to Spotify's over 345 million global listeners. The music distributor has snubbed global music giant Apple Music in the past, with the US tech giant failing to secure many local titles when it launched in South Korea in 2016 and has since struggled to gain a significant market presence. Kakao Entertainment currently has a licensing deal with Apple Music for markets outside of South Korea, according to a company official. The conflict also comes as Kakao is aiming for its entertainment business to enter overseas markets. On Thursday, the local tech giant launched Kakao Entertainment Corp. by merging Kakao M and webcomic unit Kakao Page with goals to take on the global entertainment market based on its trove of artists and original content. As of now, Spotify faces growing pressure to clinch deals with Kakao M or risk losing its presence in South Korea and its global K-pop fans. ""The clash between the two companies was inevitable,"" Lee said. ""It's now important to watch what precedent they will set.""

K-pop songstress IU to release new album on March 25,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2568768,2021.03.04 09:29,"IU, one of the K-pop scene's most prominent female solo acts, is set to drop her fifth full album later this month, her agency confirmed Thursday. Titled ""Lilac,"" the singer-songwriter's studio album will be released March 25, according to EDAM Entertainment. It did not elaborate on the details of the upcoming album.

The new album comes four years after IU's successful fourth full album ""Palette,"" with the lead track of the same title featuring rapper G-Dragon. In January, the singer unveiled the single ""Celebrity,"" one of the songs that will be included on the upcoming album. The upbeat pop number went onto top local music charts.

Spotify suspends music streaming service of K-pop provided by Kakao M,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2566772,2021.03.01 13:57,"Global streaming giant Spotify Technology SA on Monday suspended the streaming service of K-pop tracks licensed by Kakao M on its global platform as their license deal has expired, officials said. The move has prevented global K-pop fans from listening to songs of major South Korean artists, including IU and Apink, through Spotify. The Swedish company said it has failed to reach an agreement on a new license deal with Kakao M, South Korea's top music distributor, despite efforts to clinch a contract over the past 1 1/2 years. Spotify launched its music streaming service in South Korea last month as it seeks to succeed in the local market with playlists specifically tailored for Korean listeners. It has faced heated competition against established homegrown services, including Kakao Corp.'s Melon, Genie Music under telecom operator KT Corp. and rival carrier SK Telecom's Flo. Spotify had provided Kakao M's music streaming service globally, but it has not offered such service on its Korean platform as both sides have yet to clinch a related deal. Spotify said the expiration of its global license deal with Kakao M has nothing to do with the latest launch of its Korean service. But Kakao M said the suspension came in accordance with Spotify's policy under which it seeks to clinch deals on domestic and global services simultaneously. The two companies said they will continue to hold negotiations. Spotify has more than 60 million songs on its playlist, with 345 million users across 170 markets. As of October last year, Melon ranked as the country's top music streaming service with 8.81 million monthly active users, followed by Genie Music at 4.47 million and Flo at 2.86 million, according to mobile tracker IGAWorks.

A look back on IU’s 13-year music career,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2561258,2021.02.19 11:04,"Artist to release fifth studio album soon “I want to say this to those people who were born rough yet special, including my friend. You’re not strange but stellar.” IU’s latest single, “Celebrity,” embodies that message -- for her friend, for herself and for everyone who finds it hard to love themselves, as the singer wrote in her introduction to the song. The song’s lyrics started off as a letter to a friend who is often considered odd by others. Writing down the words, IU realized they were not only for her friend but for herself and everyone else too, because we all have those moments in life when we feel out of place and isolated. Consolation is one of the core themes of the singer-songwriter’s work, as seen in “Through the Night” and “Dear Name.” But unlike those calm and soothing scores, “Celebrity” features a bright electro-pop sound. IU is attempting the genre for the first time in her 13-year career. With the prerelease single, IU has not only succeeded in landing atop the charts, she has also proved herself as a solid musician, one who is still evolving and expanding. IU stands at the pinnacle of South Korea’s entertainment scene, expanding her career both as a K-pop soloist and an actor. The 28-year-old tops the charts anytime she releases a new song, whether it’s a ballad or a dance, pop or folk song, and has led popular drama series from “My Mister” (2018) to “Hotel del Luna” (2019), building a reputation as a well-rounded entertainer like no other. On Sept. 18, 2008, IU -- real name Lee Ji-eun -- debuted as a solo singer with the EP “Lost and Found,” led by the track “A Lost Child.” Singing sad ballads at the age of 15, IU initially failed to grab listeners’ hearts. She says she thought at the time that the album might be her first and last. The next year, she released her first full-length album, “Growing Up,” led by dance track “Boo,” followed by another dance set. “IU…IM,” led by “Marshmallow,” was a breakthrough for IU. With “Nagging” (2010), featuring Lim Seul-ong of then-popular boy band 2AM, IU landed at No. 1 on the domestic music charts for the first time. Perhaps the start to IU’s triumphant career, “Good Day” topped the charts and music shows upon its release. IU finally made her name known, especially with the powerful triple high notes that became a sensation in and out of Korea. In the domestic music scene -- then dominated by K-pop idol groups and big-name ballad singers -- IU proved that a young female soloist could succeed with dance songs. In 2011, IU dropped her second album -- “Last Fantasy” led by “You & I.” This song was the first of IU’s age-oriented songs and was followed by “Twenty-Three,” “Palette” and “Eight.” While “You & I” was a huge commercial success, it was acclaimed for its authentic sound, incorporating big band music and instrumentals. IU also made inroads into Billboard with this track, topping the K-pop Hot 100 for the first time and peaking at No. 3 on the World Digital Song Sales chart. In 2013, with her third studio set, “Modern Times,” IU deviated from her usual sweet airy sound and girlish image. The lead track, “The Red Shoes,” incorporates various genres from jazz to swing and features an elaborate chorus. Not only did she prove herself capable of performing different styles of music, she landed at the top of the charts with all 13 tracks from the album. IU had a turning point as a singer-songwriter with the acoustic pop song “Friday,” included in the repackaged version of “Modern Times.” The seasonal love song “Not Spring, Love, or Cherry Blossom” further proved her capabilities as both a writer and a producer. With EP “Chat-shire” in 2015, IU took on the production of a whole album, marking the start of her career as a versatile artist capable of producing, writing and performing her own music. She also got bolder about expressing her personal thoughts through music. In “Twenty-Three,” she sings of the contradictory emotions she experienced at that age, caught between childhood and adulthood. The 2014 EP “A Flower Bookmark,” featuring remade oldies from the 1980s and 1990s, highlighted her talents of reinterpretation as she struck a careful balance between preserving the original song and delivering it through her authentic sound. In 2017, IU released “A Flower Bookmark 2” and said the series would continue. IU takes her introspection deeper with “Palette,” from her eponymous fourth regular album released in 2017. The lyrics show how much more mature and stable the 25-year-old IU has become. She presents the diverse colors of life, just like a palette, singing, “I got this. I’m truly fine.” This song also marks G-Dragon’s first time collaborating with a female solo artist outside YG. With time, IU became more daring, writing about her thoughts through unique sounds unheard elsewhere. “Bbibbi,” a laid-back alternative R&B single released in 2018 to mark her 10th anniversary, and “Blueming,” an upbeat song about the “blue” experience of falling in love, are good examples of this. The last of IU’s age-oriented songs, “Eight,” made in collaboration with BTS member Suga, nostalgically explores the diverse emotions faced by the two 28-year-old artists. With “Eight,” IU and Suga made it to the top of Billboard’s World Digital Song Sales chart. Besides G-Dragon and Suga, IU has collaborated with some of the world’s best musicians, transcending genres and generations. They include rapper Zico, Oh Hyuk of band Hyukoh, legendary hip-hop trio Epik High, first-generation K-pop idol group g.o.d and veteran actor-musician Kim Chang-wan. Now an established actor, IU boasts a TV presence as well. Not only does she lead a number of popular dramas, she has actively taken part in the production of music for TV. She has also had huge hits with variety shows featuring her such as “Hyori’s Homestay” (2017) and “House on Wheels” (2020). With “Celebrity,” released Jan. 27, IU gave fans a peek at her fifth studio album, slated to be dropped in the weeks to come. While no other information about the album has been released, and the exact release date is still unknown, the prerelease single piqued anticipation about what wonders and soothing messages IU will unravel through the set.

Suwon sets example in policies against COVID-19,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2560625,2021.02.17 18:19,"Suwon leads with preemptive measures to fight coronavirus, while providing citizen-centered policies in a range of fields The population of Suwon City is 1.23 million, the largest among Gyeonggi Province’s 31 cities and counties, but its number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people is third from last. The achievement was thanks to the dedication of citizens, health center employees, public officials and medical workers, who followed the quarantine rules despite the inconvenience and economic losses. Suwon City took rapid countermeasures whenever there was an outbreak of the new coronavirus. In what some view as a positive overreaction, the city actively took part in quarantine policies, setting a prime example of K-quarantine. Judging that it is difficult to block family from spreading the virus through just self-isolation, the local government began running temporary facilities to accommodate confirmed patients in February 2020, marking the first such case in Korea. Last March, when the number of overseas patients began to surge, the city introduced the nation’s first system to manage overseas arrivals to prevent further transmission while traveling home from the airport. The city also enforced a temporary testing facility for symptom-free arrivals to stay until test results arrive as well as accommodation services that allow families to use hotels at low prices while overseas patients stay in quarantine. With treatment facilities becoming scarce due to the third wave of the pandemic, the city operated temporary centers for treatment and self-quarantine until patients with mild symptoms could get access to hospital beds. Also in February last year, the National Assembly passed a partial revision of the act on prevention and management of infectious diseases, authorizing contact tracers. The revision was based on a policy proposal by Mayor Yeom Tae-young, who had pushed for the measure since the MERS outbreak in 2015. “The best way to prevent COVID-19 outbreak is through prevention,” Yeom said. In January 2021, as a measure to prevent group infections from asymptomatic cases, he completed a full inspection on citizens who are prone to face-to-face contact, including workers from Delta Flex, day care centers, visiting caregivers, public transportation workers and residents of multi-family houses. Moreover, mass inspection was carried out through rapid antigen testing and daily prevention methods were strengthened in public health and medical sectors. A health management department was established in Jangan-gu Health Center and a response team was established for a faster, more efficient management of the virus.　 With vaccinations on the way starting this February, Suwon City will also ensure a fast and safe vaccination system. In addition to the quarantine measures, the city also pushes for policies for the safety of its citizens. First, the city unveiled a blueprint for a safe city. As concerns for child abuse grow, child protection system was further strengthened. Starting from 2016, Suwon City formed the Suwon Child Protection Agency and enacted the ordinance on prevention and protection of child abuse. December of the same year, Children’s Protection Agency was formed as a foundation of child abuse. Last December, the city enacted a subcommittee on child welfare deliberation, involving city officials, police, doctors, education support offices and child protection agencies. The city is also continuing to make efforts to support children in need. Some children, including those who are not vaccinated, took long absence from kindergarten or daycare or have unclear addresses. They will be checked out in 44 districts and if suspected child abuse cases are found, immediate protection measures will be taken together with the Suwon Child Protection Agency and the police. The long-cherished ambition of constructing a new police station in Paldal-gu is finally moving forward. Building work will begin this June and will be completed next December. It will be constructed on a 15,052-square-meter site near Motgol intersection with a basement floor and three floors above ground. Also, sidewalks, green areas and small parks will be built in public open areas for a cleaner, safer living in Suwon City. Using the infrastructure of the Urban Safety Integration Center, Suwon City is fostering a “Smart City System.” With 12,304 security cameras in operation, the city boasts the highest number out of all local governments nationwide. As a comprehensive safety measure, the city has been increasing the number of security cameras since 2012. Personnel working at the Urban Safety Integration Center watch 24 hours a day for the safety of Suwon citizens. If a crime is suspected, security camera footage can be provided after notifying police to prevent further harm. In an effort to create a safe city without any blind spots, the city will install more cameras in 46 blind spots and improve the performance of 79 more. Suwon also plans to develop a safe city through an emergency vehicle priority signaling system. The city will expand the system from two vehicles to four vehicles this year. The system, which is expected to help secure crucial time in emergency situations, tracks the location of emergency vehicles with GPS. When a vehicle approaches an intersection, the signal will automatically turn green. With this, it would take less then 10 minutes to reach Ajou University Hospital and St. Vincent Hospital. Suwon is also handing out financial support to pandemic-hit citizens. “There are too many struggling small merchants, mom-and-pop shops, small and medium-sized merchants that make my heart heavy,” Yeom said. Businesses that were restricted or suspended due to social distancing rules faced even more damage, especially with the start of Level 2.5 rules. “Although restrictions are inevitable to prevent further spread of the virus, it is not only too harsh but unfair to put the burden on the business owners and employees,” he added.　 The past three rounds of relief funds were not enough to make up for business losses. Suwon will put in every effort to ensure compensation for those who were damaged by the quarantine measures. Suwon will also carry out support programs for small business owners. The city is to contribute 900 million won ($816,000) to the Special Guarantee of Small Businesses project and will provide special fees to small businesses that received special guarantees. Special guarantees will help small businesses with that have poor credit ratings or lack security to borrow loans through the Gyeonggi Credit Guarantee Foundation. The city will implement projects to help support businesses including customized consulting for small business owners, as well as those which will help improve the business environment. Local tax benefits will be also provided to those who participate in the Good Landlord Campaign by offering reimbursements of 2020 and 2021 property taxes. The deduction rate is calculated by how much rent was reduced by and how long for. Landlords can receive up to 40 percent reimbursements of property tax if they decrease rent by 10 percent. In Suwon, more than 1,230 shops are believed to have received rent discounts in the first half of last year. Suwon Pay incentives will be set at 10 percent this year. If one deposits 100,000 won, an additional 10,000 won will be added as a bonus. Suwon will promote and improve its functions, including a mobile app card for convenience, and plans to encourage citizens to use Suwon Pay for purchases at small businesses. Suwon City conducted a survey from September to October last year on the impact of prolonged COVID-19 outbreak. Among 1,247 registered manufacturing companies surveyed, 71.3 percent responded that their business conditions had worsened. To help such businesses, Suwon will provide 1.49 billion won through four projects, focusing on small to medium-sized business. The support measures include a small to medium-sized enterprise promotion fund. The city will also push for projects such as customized consulting, intellectual property support and promotion of startups to further promote the growth of small to medium-sized enterprises. With small to medium-sized export companies struggling due to travel restrictions and absence of export fairs, Suwon will produce a promotion film of startups and their products. For additional support, the city will also provide “door-to-door export shipping,” to simplify the export process. The city also plans to beef up socially distanced export marketing support, while aiming to create 36,000 jobs in the local area this year. Last year, Suwon became a role model city and implemented a set of innovative policies that suited its special city status. For instance, the city’s traffic became more efficient with the opening of Suin Line and Suwonbukbusunhwan-ro. The city’s administrative efforts, such as the adjustment of administrative districts and the completion of the second phase of the agricultural and fishery wholesale market, to make the lives of citizens more convenient, paid off one after another.　 With the completion of the third stage of the Suin Line double-track railway in September 2020, Goseok Station and Omokcheon Station were officially opened. The entire Suin Line was finally reconnected after 25 years, allowing residents in western Suwon to use the subway to reach nearby places, including Ansan, Yongin, Seongnam, Seoul and Incheon. In particular, Suwon decided to build the Suwon section of the Suin Line underground and set up a space for residents on the ground level, creating the foundation for future development of the Seosuwon area. Suwonbukbusunhwan-ro, which connects Imok-dong, Jangan-gu to Iui-dong, Yeongtong-gu was finally opened on Sept. 21. As Suwon’s first private investment project, the road allows travel from North Suwon to Gwanggyo, Yongin and Gwangju without passing through the city center, making traffic easier for the whole of Suwon. Traffic around the administrative town of West Suwon, which had been experiencing frequent congestion, was also improved. With a 940-meter elevated highway at the intersection opening in last August, the section connecting Homaesil IC and Suwon Station has been smoothed out and the convenience of citizens traveling to and from the Homaesil district has also increased. Suwon Station is considered a major achievement in establishing Suwon as the largest base station in southern Gyeonggi Province. Suwon Station is currently at the center of the Gyeongbu Line, National Railroad Line 1, Suin and Bundang Line. In addition, with projects like the GTX-C line, which will connect Deokjeong Station, as well as the KTX direct project, Suwon City’s role as a transportation hub in southern Gyeonggi will inevitably expand. Suwon’s plans for Suwon Station East Transfer Center has been selected as the best pilot project for the Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Railway Station Transfer Center’ sponsored by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport Metropolitan Transport Committee. The transfer center plans to connect the traffic island in the center of Suwon Station Square to Rodeo Street to create a pedestrian axis that connects Suwon Station, Suwon Station Square and Rodeo Street as well as to relocate the bus stop scattered in the eastern square right in front of the station. With this, transfer time is expected to be reduced to less than three minutes, congestion at nearby bus stops will be partially alleviated and the center will be able to be reborn as a human-centered square. The second phase of the project to modernize Suwon agricultural and fishery wholesale market was also completed without hardships. Suwon Agricultural and Fishery Products Wholesale Market, which opened in February 1993, began renovation through the Circular Redevelopment method due to severe aging of facilities. While the merchants continued on with their business activities, Suwon City established a step by step redevelopment plan to restore business functions after improvement of facilities. The plan first arranged temporary stores in the vegetable department then newly constructed the fruit and fisheries department as the second stage. In order to minimize users’ inconvenience, a total of 82 consultations were held over three years and requirements were collected for a communicative administration. Fruit wholesalers who are a part of three wholesale corporations moved into the fruit department, which has 54 stores with a size of 22 square meters. Moreover, 60 stores from two wholesale corporations moved into the fisheries department. These stores have been operating since Aug. 31 of last year. After the merchants enter the revamped vegetable department in the old fruit and fisheries building by the end of next year, the agricultural and fishery wholesale market is expected to become Suwon’s center market. Suwon City made adjustments to the administrative district with Yongin City last year and further succeeded in adjusting the administrative district with Hwaseong City this year to preemptively facilitate the residents’ use of administrative services. Suwon City had been discussing how to adjust the administrative boundaries with Hwaseong City since 2014 and was able to finally draw an agreement. This is to prevent inconveniences from moving into the multi-family houses around the deformed boundary area of Suwon City. By exchanging 190,000 square meters of land with Hwaseong City, 550 residents were ultimately incorporated into Suwon City on July 24, allowing them to enjoy closer living facilities. This is the result of the administration that prioritizes the convenience of its residents. Suwon also won recognition for its efforts. The city continued to raise safety awareness through safety practices and education as well as civic participation campaigns for creating a community-involved safety culture. As a result, Suwon City won the grand prize in the Basic Local Government Sector (Presidential Award) of the 2020 Safety Culture Awards hosted by the Ministry of Public Administration and Security on Dec. 11 last year. On Nov. 19, Suwon received the Presidential Award for the Emergency Vehicle Priority Signaling System at the 2020 Active Administrative Excellence Competition jointly held by the Ministry of Public Administration and Security and the Ministry of Personnel Management. Suwon also won the Presidential Prize of the 22nd Sustainable Development Awards, hosted by the Ministry of Environment and organized by the Sustainable Development Council, for its food-sharing policy in which citizens can share refrigerators voluntarily. In recognition of its efforts to introduce design management into the administrative system, it won the Presidential Award at the 2020 Korea Design Awards organized by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.

Spotify set for uphill battle in S. Korea,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2557240,2021.02.14 11:26,"Spotify Technology SA, which opened its service in South Korea early this month, is expected to face fierce competition in the music streaming market currently dominated by local players. While the Swedish company is one of the top audio streaming services in the world, with 345 million users across 93 markets, it is up against established homegrown services in South Korea -- the sixth-largest music market in the world -- such as tech giant Kakao Corp.'s Melon, Genie Music under telecom operator KT Corp. and rival carrier SK Telecom's Flo. As of October last year, Melon ranked as the country's top music streaming service with 8.81 million monthly active users, followed by Genie Music at 4.47 million and Flo at 2.86 million, according to mobile tracker IGAWorks. Spotify has said it aims to succeed in the local market with playlists specifically tailored for South Korean listeners that are created by using its latest algorithm and a team of K-pop experts. The audio streaming giant's trove of over 70 million tracks and 4 billion playlists, however, lacks songs of some major South Korean artists, such as IU, leaving many wondering whether it may follow the path of Apple Music, which struggled to draw users after failing to secure local music. Spotify has yet to clinch a deal with entertainment giant Kakao M, the country's top music distributor and a Kakao subsidiary. The Swedish audio giant is still betting on its broader platform taking off, with its podcast service set for launch in the country sometime this year. The company said it will focus on securing local podcast content as well as providing original and exclusive podcasts for the country. Spotify will also have to fend off competition from new contenders in the audio streaming sector, such as audio-chat social media service Clubhouse. The invite-only app, developed by US-based Alpha Exploration Co., has recently taken South Korea's online forums by storm, with users selling app invitations online for as much as 19,000 won ($17). Spotify's entry into South Korea has prodded local rivals to bolster their services. Genie Music said early this month that it will provide a real-time playlist of songs that appear on TV music competition programs and establish an open music database feature in which users can participate. Flo joined hands with local audiobook service Welaaa last month to offer audiobooks on the music streaming platform.

[Digital Simplicity] Spotify and Teleparty signal importance of new digital experience,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2552781,2021.02.06 16:02,"Audio streaming service Spotify made its debut in South Korea on Tuesday, signaling a fresh round of competition among streaming apps. A lot of digital music fans here have high hopes for Spotify, which has a library of some 60 million songs and allows users to listen to plenty of music under a “freemium” plan. The high level of attention Spotify attracts actually reflects the solid positions of Korean streaming players such as Melon, Genie Music and Flo. Even though Apple Music, a digital music service offered by Apple, has been available in the local market, its influence is far smaller than Korean rivals, and some predict that things might change with the official debut of Spotify. As part of the initial marketing campaign, users can listen to all music on Spotify free-of-charge for three months, after which paid subscriptions are required. Spotify’s subscription plan is set at 10,900 won ($9.70) for a single user and 16,350 won for dual accounts, before tax. Given that local streaming providers charge an average of under 8,200 won per month, Spotify’s plan is not so competitive in terms of pricing. Korean media outlets also point out that Spotify, just like Apple Music, does not boast the Korean catalog to meet demand here. For instance, neither Spotify nor Apple Music offer albums from IU, one of the country’s most popular singers, which is a make-or-break issue for many digital music users in Korea. But it is too early to brush off the potential of Spotify. The giant music streaming provider has a whopping 320 million users in 92 countries and carves out a respectable 34 percent share in the global music service market. Not only its vast music library, but also a rich reserve of playlists help sort out a selection of music tailored for users with different tastes. Melon, which controls 34 percent of the Korean digital music market, has a library of 40 million songs, with 8.78 million users. The other major players are Genie Music (23 percent), Flow (16 percent) and YouTube Music (14 percent). Recently, Melon drastically overhauled the design of its streaming app, perhaps aware that its competitive edge might be tested as Spotify enters the Korean market. Melon’s new interface appears to be modeled on leading streaming apps, but some might be dissatisfied with the design since many of the detailed options are hidden. The real test, meanwhile, is whether Korean streaming apps can provide something different or essential to users who are now quite familiar with customization and personalization functions based on artificial intelligence and other related technologies. Instead of searching for new music, users want apps or services to go out and pick the best selections suitable for different situations. The core competition now lies in the technological depth that can appeal to tech-savvy users. In line with the dominance of streaming apps in the music field, video services have shifted to streaming mode too, and something innovative is afoot. A range of music and video streaming apps were originally designed to help users individually enjoy what they want to listen to or watch. In recent months, users of such streaming apps want to join others and create a simultaneous and collective experience. Teleparty, formerly Netflix Party, is one case in point. The service allows Netflix users to watch TV with friends online, as the video playback is synchronized. As with other sports and PC games, music and video users want to talk about content with friends in real time, creating digital experiences that are more entertaining and rewarding that those enjoyed alone. It is not certain whether Korean streaming players will come up with services similar to Teleparty, but what’s clear is that they have to develop better and more innovative digital music experiences to shore up their market position in the coming years.

Spotify begins service in Korea without IU’s songs,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2550896,2021.02.02 18:04,"The world’s largest music streaming platform Spotify on Tuesday announced the official launch of its service in Korea. “We’re looking forward to working even closer with the entire Korean music industry to uncover more artists and connect them with fans in Korea and the world, while also continuously working on providing an ever-improving, unrivaled listening experience to Korean listeners,” Alex Norstrom, Spotify’s chief freemium business officer, said in a statement. Korean users have access to over 60 million tracks and 4 billion playlists, the global audio streaming subscription service said. Spotify also emphasized that it aims to capture the local market with playlists specifically tailored for South Korean users, as well as its high-quality recommendation engine. Currently, the global streaming platform provides two different kinds of subscription options in Korea -- Premium Individual that costs 10,900 won ($9.80) a month and Premium Duo that costs 16,350 won a month, exclusive of taxes. With the premium service, subscribers can access music streaming with high sound quality, play downloaded music without an internet connection and enjoy music with no ad interruptions. Premium Duo is a two-person plan that offers two separate Spotify Premium accounts on one bill. Listeners in Korea can try out Spotify’s premium service free for seven days on their mobile phones without providing any credit card information. Those who provide their credit card information can enjoy premium services for three months free of charge. These free trials will be available through the end of June. Meanwhile, local music industry insiders have downplayed Spotify’s possible impact on the highly competitive Korean market. It has yet to sign deals to provide Korean music tracks from local music distribution giants like Kakao M, which owns tracks of popular singers such as IU, Zico and Monsta X. Many industry insiders are also curious as to why Spotify decided to launch without Kakao M. Spotify had announced on Dec. 18 that it would launch its service in Korea sometime in the first half of 2021. “We are still talking with Spotify (about distributing our songs through their platform),” a Kakao M spokesperson told The Korea Herald on Tuesday. Kakao M runs Korea’s largest music streaming platform Melon, which enjoys a 37.5 percent local market share. Korean platforms Genie and Flo follow in market share and the three platforms together account for more than 80 percent of the market here. The lack of Korean artists’ tracks has been considered one of the main obstacles that global audio streaming companies, such as Apple Music, face in seeking to expand in the Korean market, according to music industry sources. Apple Music, which entered the Korean market in 2016, struck deals with three entertainment companies -- SM Entertainment, JYP Entertainment and YG Entertainment -- for their artists’ music tracks. However, it also failed to sign on Kakao M. Meanwhile, Spotify on Tuesday named David Park as its managing director for Korea. “Our team on the ground has been working closely with local artists, labels and cultural tastemakers to offer an unrivaled music listening and discovery experience, ensuring that Spotify is going to be loved by listeners and artists in Korea,” Park said in a statement. Before joining Spotify, Park worked as the general manager at UberEats Korea, leading its diversification and expansion here. After graduating Korea University in 2003 with a degree in communications and journalism, he also worked for multiple content creation firms, including YouTube Korea and CJ Entertainment.

Original musicals to light up stage in February,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2547358,2021.01.27 15:47,"TvN hit drama “Hotel Del Luna” to be made into musical in 2022 Though the theater scene is still suffering as a result of the social distancing rules imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, the month of February may be a turning point as a number of original South Korean musicals are lined up for premieres. “The Adventure of the Final Problem” is slated to run Feb. 15 to May 9 at the Dream Arts Center. 　 The production tells the story of British writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who attained huge success with his “Sherlock Holmes” series. The musical will focus on the death of the fictional detective in the short story “The Adventure of the Final Problem,” published in 1893. Stage actors Kim Jong-gu, Hong Seung-an and Kim Chan-jong have been cast as Doyle. Jeong Min, Cho Pung-rae and Paek Ki-beom are to play Holmes. Director Seong Jae-jun is to lead the show, complete with the musical numbers created by composer Hong Jeong-eui. Comedy musical “Who Lives in Kuroi Mansion?” is set to premiere next month at Plus Theater in central Seoul, where it will run Feb. 18 to March 21. The story, set during the Japanese colonial period, revolves around Hae-woong and Ok-hee and the ghosts at Kuroi Mansion. Stage actors Jung Wook-jin and Choi Min-woo are to play Hae-woong, while Song Na-young and Hong Na-hyun are to play Ok-hee, with director Kim Dong-hyun at the helm. The musical was selected through the Chungmu Art Center’s debut program for writers in 2018, and Pyo Sang-ah wrote the script. Though it is set in dark times, the musical bills itself as a humorous production with elements of comedy. Occult film “The Priests” has been made into a musical, which is set to run Feb. 25 to May 30 at Uniplex in central Seoul. The 2015 film, starring big-name actors Gang Dong-won, Kim Yoon-seok and “Parasite” star Park So-dam, was seen by 5.45 million theatergoers. The supernatural mystery thriller featured two Roman Catholic priests, played by Kang and Kim, who try to help a young girl possessed by an evil spirit, played by Park. Park shot to stardom for her portrayal of the possessed girl. The musical production team, consisting of writer Gang Nam, composer Kim Hyo-eun and director Orphina, also produced the original Korean musical “Hope,” which premiered in 2019. Deacon Choi will be played by stage actors Kim Kyeong-su, Kim Chan-ho, Cho Hyeong-kyun and Jang Ji-hu. Father Kim will be played by Lee Gun-myung, Song Yong-jin and Park Yu-deok.　 Further ahead, tvN drama “Hotel Del Luna” will be made into a musical in 2022. The hit tvN drama, featuring IU and Yeo Jin-gu as lead characters, aired in 2019. The horror-romance drama series is set in the eponymous hotel, which caters to ghost guests. The script was written by star screenwriter duo Hong Jung-eun and Hong Mi-ran, better known as the Hong sisters. According to production company Showplay, the new musical will go onstage next year. It will feature some episodes from the original drama, along with some new details. The exact dates for the musical have yet to be set.

BTS grabs 4th album of the year trophy at Golden Disc Awards,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2535560,2021.01.11 15:13,"BTS won album of the year at the 35th Golden Disc Awards on Sunday, grabbing the trophy for the fourth consecutive year, further cementing its position as the most popular boy band in the country.

Top Korean artists reach over 10.6b streams on Spotify in 2020,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2533152,2021.01.09 16:01,"Korea’s top 10 most streamed artists on Spotify chalked up a total of 10.6 billion streams on the platform in 2020, the popular streaming service announced on Thursday in its yearly wrap up. 　 Boy band BTS was the most streamed Korean artist globally, followed by Blackpink, Twice, Stray Kids and Red Velvet, according to Spotify’s 2020 Wrapped data. BTS also took the top spot in the category of the most-streamed global group in 2020. 2020 Wrapped, which compiles data from Jan. 1 to Nov. 15, is the operator’s annual flagship campaign that shows how its 320 million users around the world use their platform. Singer IU topped the list of most-streamed Korean female artists, while Agust D, better known as Suga of BTS, was ranked the most-streamed male artist last year. Spotify also unveiled several up-and-coming Korean rookie artists on its platform. Boy band Treasure topped the list of most-streamed rising Korean artists, followed by solo singer AleXa and singer-songwriter Bibi, data showed. Artist Secret Number and A.C.E also made it to the top 10. “The 2020 Wrapped data is another testament to Spotify’s commitment to the global success of Korean artists and music, helping them connect with and reach a global audience,” Spotify’s vice president Marian Dicus said in a statement. 　 Spotify announced last month that it will launch its service in South Korea in the first half of this year. The Swedish firm plans to give Korean listeners access to over 60 million tracks and over 4 billion playlists. “With our upcoming launch in South Korea, we are hoping to help accelerate the growth of Korea’s entire music streaming ecosystem, ultimately benefiting artists, listeners and fans,” Dicus said.

Spotify to launch in Korea in first half of 2021,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2518304,2020.12.18 15:34,"The world’s largest music streaming platform Spotify on Friday announced that it would officially launch its service in South Korea in the first half of 2021. “We are excited about our upcoming launch in South Korea, a market recognized as an epicenter for music, culture and tech innovation,” Alex Norstrom, chief freemium business officer of Spotify, said in a statement. According to Spotify, South Korea -- the sixth-largest music market globally -- is an important market for accomplishing its mission to connect creative artists with music fans worldwid. The global audio streaming subscription service will give Korean listeners access to over 60 million tracks and over 4 billion playlists, the company said. The streaming platform operator, known for its AI-based music curation service, highlighted that it will enable diverse Korean artists to reach local music fans, as well as Spotify’s 320 million global listeners. Although this is the first time that Spotify is entering Korea‘s streaming market, it is not its first time working with local musicians. The Swedish audio streaming provider debuted its first K-pop playlist in 2014. Since then, its users have have streamed more than 180 billion minutes of the genre and added K-pop tracks to more than 120 million Spotify playlists. The share of K-pop listening has increased by more than 2,000 percent in the last six years, according to Spotify. According to the local music industry insiders, the global streaming giant’s performance in the Korean market will depend on whether it can successfully provide Korean artists’ tracks through the platform by joining hands with large K-pop powerhouses here. In 2016, another global audio streaming service provider, Apple Music, entered the Korean market, signing contacts with three entertainment companies — S.M. Entertainment, JYP Entertainment and YG Entertainment. However, it failed to provide tracks of Kakao M’s artists, which include popular singers like IU. This has been considered one of the limitations to Apple Music’s expansion in the local market, according to music industry sources. Currently, Kakao runs Korea’s largest music streaming platform Melon, which has a more than 35 percent share of the local market, followed by Korean platforms Genie and Flo. The three platforms together account for more than 80 percent of the market here. Regarding questions on whether it had signed contracts with all the main local entertainment companies and how many Korean tracks it will provide to Korean users, Spotify declined to answer. “We cannot comment on specific licensing agreements,” a Spotify spokesperson told The Korea Herald on Friday. “We are committed to ensuring close alignment and partnership with key stakeholders through mutual, collaborative and transparent discussions.” By Song Seung-hyun ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2020/12/18/20201218000559_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
"BTS wins big, performs at K-pop awards show MAMA 2020",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2504632,2020.12.07 09:21,"After winning trophies at major music awards around the world, BTS picked up the top prizes at the Mnet Asian Music Awards (MAMA), the biggest year-end music awards show in the K-pop industry, held late Sunday. The seven-piece group took home all four of the grand prizes -- Artist of the Year, Song of the Year, Album of the Year and Worldwide Icon of the Year -- at the annual music ceremony that was held virtually amid the new coronavirus pandemic. BTS also picked up Best Male Group, as well as Best Music Video and Best Dance Performance - Male Group for its upbeat disco-pop hit ""Dynamite,"" which was the first song by a Korean pop music act to debut at No. 1 on Billboard's main singles chart. ""Eight,"" a song recorded by singer-songwriter IU and BTS member Suga, was named Best Collaboration. Separately, Bang Si-hyuk, the head of BTS' management agency Big Hit Entertainment, won Best Executive Producer of the Year. BTS performed three of its hit songs for the show. It kicked off its gig with a pre-recorded shoot at the Seoul World Cup Stadium where the members clad in white, cadet-like uniforms performed ""ON."" They then went on to perform the Billboard-topping hit ""Dynamite,"" with the performance ending with virtual fireworks and purple-lit letters that read ""Light On."" BTS wrapped up its gig with ""Life Goes On,"" the main track for its latest album ""BE."" The sweeping win marks another feat for BTS, which has had one of the best years in its seven-year career this year, scoring record No. 1s on Billboard, winning prizes at major US music awards and getting a Grammy nomination -- the first for a pop music act from South Korea -- for the ceremony slated for January. ""Somehow one year has passed. I feel that we have passionately lived this year, but it went by so quickly that I cannot remember well, and I don't know what to make of it,"" Jimin said after the group won Artist of the Year, recalling the chaos that has hit the world this year. ""But despite it, we endured it and defended it. Like we spent this year, we'll be here next year striving forward with you."" ""I wonder if the world is really wide. Of course the world is wide, but in the territory of music and love, the world is not wide. It's really small actually,"" RM, who appeared onstage wearing a face mask, said after the group received Worldwide Icon of the Year. He went on to thank ARMY, the group's strong fan base around the world, for their unwavering support and love. Jungkook also thanked fans for being a source of inspiration that has led the team -- that was ""once only full of passion, vigor and grit"" -- to become musicians that can share their fans' support and love through their songs with more people. BTS also hinted on an upcoming music video next year. ""We wrapped up this year with 'Life Goes On,' but we are going to bring an incredible music video next year, so please look forward to it. We'll be the BTS that only brings love to ARMY,"" V said. While Suga, the group's member who is taking a short break following a shoulder surgery, did not appear onstage, BTS called him over the phone so that he could deliver a thank you message to fans for the Album of the Year win. Girl group BLACKPINK won Best Female Group and Best Dance Performance - Female Group for its megahit ""How You Like That,"" while Baekhyun took the prize for Best Male Artist. IU took home Best Female Artist as well as Best Vocal Performance - Solo for ""Blueming."" Quartet Mamamoo won Best Vocal Performance - Group, while its member Hwasa also clinched Best Dance Performance - Solo.

The winners were NCT, Treasure, Tomorrow X Together, GOT7, ATEEZ, Seventeen, Mamamoo, TWICE, BTS and BLACKPINK. K-pop songstress BoA, who received a special prize for her 20-year contribution to the K-pop industry, held a special performance with hit songs like ""No. 1"" and ""Only One."" Launched in 1999 under the name Mnet Km Music Festival, the event was renamed MAMA in 2009 as the show expanded its outreach throughout Asia. Since then, it has mostly been held as multiday events at venues across Asia, such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. This year, however, the awards were held as a single-day event in South Korea, as COVID-19 hampered performance schedules and flights. Most musicians who appeared onstage for acceptance speeches wore face masks, and staff members were seen disinfecting the main stage after each guest. While fans could not attend the usually extravagant event, screens mirroring faces of audience members tuning in from around the world were shown in the televised awards ceremony. ""MAMA has grown throughout the years while constantly innovating itself. We believe this year's contactless event will also provide a new opportunity to transform the show,"" a CJ ENM representative said in September as the company announced the plan to hold it virtually.

"[Digital Simplicity] IU, 8K display and next-generation gaming",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2434207,2020.09.26 16:00,"Last Saturday, singer IU’s newest live performance video was revealed on YouTube. It was a landmark event since the video was formatted in 8K resolution, which easily outperforms 4K display. A small number of those who purchased the prohibitively expensive and visually expansive 88-inch OLED TV from LG Electronics were lucky enough to get a glimpse of what the 8K technology could offer, thanks to the stunning image featuring IU’s equally exquisite live performance. Just in case you have no idea who IU is, let me introduce her a bit. IU (whose name is Lee Ji-eun) is a top singer-songwriter and actress and has a huge fan base here -- so much so that a lot of Korean music fans helplessly stick to home-grown streaming music services largely because Apple Music, apparently due to copyright and contract issues, does not provide her music in the Korean market. The 8K video uploaded on YouTube, in which IU belted out her hit song “You & I” on “You Heeyeol’s Sketchbook” music program, garnered more than 500,000 views, and is now deemed as a reference to check whether your 8K display works properly. I watched the video with a new 4K computer monitor I bought recently. It was immensely impressive, even on 4K display. When I raised the resolution setting from 4K to 8K (fully aware that my screen is not designed to support 8K) on YouTube, the screen froze. It seems that my computer system, even with high-end options, found it hard to handle the enormous amount of digital data needed to stream 8K video. What should be noted is that KBS, a state-run TV station which aired the special program, recorded IU’s performance in 8K resolution but opted for YouTube to distribute the showcase piece. Under the current TV infrastructure, local TV stations are ill-equipped to broadcast 8K video seamlessly. I reckon that this is why KBS decided to let those who have 8K TVs and top-end desktop computers check out the eye-popping quality of the video through YouTube. For 8K TV makers such as LG Electronics and Samsung Electronics, IU’s live performance video is a blessing. Thanks to the high-profile video whose view count is likely to go up on the strength of IU’s popularity, TV makers can expect that the next-generation TV would be more readily accepted in the market, accelerating the shift from 4K to 8K. A similar technological shift is underway in the gaming industry. Both Microsoft and Sony are now getting ready to launch their next-generation video consoles later this year, promising better graphics and performance. The new machines support 4K video at 128 frames per second, a clear upgrade from today’s mainstream gaming systems. Microsoft, in particular, pins high hopes on Xbox Game Pass, a video game subscription service, which is “Netflix for video games.” Many Korean gamers at major online communities are talking about whether such subscription services could succeed, especially after Microsoft surprised the market this week by acquiring renowned US-based game developer Bethesda for $7.5 billion. Some users are considering PC-based gameplay after buying a Xbox Game Pass, while bypassing the purchase of the new console. The reason is the much-awaited debut of next-generation graphics cards, namely Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3080 and 3090 series. On Wednesday, two US tech YouTubers -- Marques Brownlee and Linus Sebastian -- rolled out videos introducing the sizzling appeal of 8K gaming powered by RTX 3090 graphics cards. Both videos were based on LG’s 88-inch OLED TV, whose retail price in Korea is set at more than 44 million won (about $37,000). To enjoy watching IU’s live performance in 8K format on a big screen, you would have to spend a lot of money upgrading your desktop computer system. The full-fledged 8K video, whether it’s a live performance on YouTube or gaming, requires the latest CPU, graphics card, TV set and other related components for a powerful desktop PC. Is it worth it? If you watch IU’s performance in 4K or lower resolution and find it good enough, a pricey upgrade to the 8K computer system could be premature. After all, 8K technology will eventually replace 4K in the coming years. Until then, many IU fans will likely feel that their smartphone screen is big enough as long as they can watch her impeccable performance.

Drawing the fine line: Artistic expression and offensive content,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2425395,2020.09.15 17:12,"Following widespread controversy over violent and sexually explicit content in his work, Naver webtoon “Hellper” author Sakk apologized Monday and said he was taking a break. It was the 248th episode of the webtoon’s second season. While controversy over “Hellper” began brewing as soon as the new season kicked off in 2016, things came to a head Sept. 11 when the local media picked up comments that had appeared on an online community site a few days earlier. The webtoon had gone too far in the latest episode, readers said. The scene that ignited the protests showed the much-loved grandmother character Pibada being tortured, stripped and injected with drugs. Although “Hellper” is restricted to readers 18 and older, many readers had expressed discomfort with its content. “Even we men think there is a definite problem when such a sexist webtoon is shown weekly without any regulations on mega platform Naver, just because there is an age restriction of 18 or above,” wrote one reader. The scene showing Pibada in distress brought out readers’ discomfort with other content in “Hellper.” The sexual objectification of women has been a consistent theme of the second season. Criminal acts such as rape, spycam filming, prostitution and sex with minors have been shown multiple times. Characters that blatantly reference celebrities such as IU, RM of BTS and Song Min-ho of Winner are shown performing indecent acts or being beaten to a pulp. “It is true that I expressed myself more freely after (the webtoon was) labelled adult content than when it was for a general audience,” said Saak. “Although Naver Webtoon officials warned me to keep the level of violence and sexual material in check so as to not disturb readers, despite it being adult content, I always went a bit beyond their guidelines because of my greed as an author.” But while Saak said he made a mistake, he insisted that the violation of Pidaba was essential to the plot and that the ultimate message of the comic is that good triumphs over evil. The only thing to blame was his lack of skill in presenting the material. “As someone who loves comics, I always thought the level of regulation for expression in comics is harsher than that for other kinds of content. So I thought to push the boundaries of expression a little,” said Saak in Monday’s announcement. “I feel that I have done the reverse and want to apologize to all those readers who love webtoons as well as other authors and fans who want to enjoy more diverse comic content.” Naver also apologized in the same announcement. “We will keep a closer eye on expressions of sensitive content and try to communicate more closely with authors,” a Naver Webtoon official said. This is the second time since last month that Naver has pledged to monitor authors’ work. The first concerned an innuendo-laden scene in author Kian84’s work. At the time, Kian84 admitted that his attempt at satire was over the line and he revised the scenes in question. Saak has also revised his controversial scenes. With few legal grounds to regulate contentious material in webtoons, it is up to authors and platforms to self-regulate.

LG U+ develops SIM-less tech for smart devices,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2417178,2020.09.08 15:19,"LG U+ announced Tuesday that the company and its global partners had developed a new technology enabling smart devices to work without SIM cards. Joining LG U+ in the development of the universal integrated circuit card, or iUICC, were cellular chipset developer Sony Semiconductor Israel, local communication module maker NTmore and German digital security solutions provider Giesecke+Devrient. SIM cards are responsible for storing users’ personal information, which is needed to identify the users’ plans and services. The iUICC replaces a SIM by putting the information on a communication chipset that powers voice and data connections. The technology will thus allow manufacturers to make smart devices smaller as they do not need to leave space for a SIM card, LG+ said. LG U+ said it plans to use the technology for other Internet of Things products, including tracking devices. The company added that it would introduce a series of IoT solutions using the SIM-less technology, as well as its own 5G network.

러시아서 멸종위기 백두산 호랑이 불법 사냥한 40대 체포,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2383007,2020.08.02 16:03,멸종위기에 처한 아무르 호랑이(일명 백두산 호랑이)를 러시아 극동에서 불법 사냥한 40대 남성이 현지 수사당국에 붙잡혔다. 2일 인테르팍스 통신에 따르면 러시아 연방 내무부 산하 하바롭스크주(州) 경찰 공보실은 지난달 29일 뱌젬스키 지역 코치코보 마을에 사는 44살의 남성을 러시아가 지정한 희귀동물을 불법으로 사냥하고 유통한 혐의로 체포해 조사하고 있다고 밝혔다. 현지 경찰은 체포 당시 이 남성이 타고 있던 승용차에서 아무르 호랑이 가죽을 발견했다. 이 호랑이 가죽에는 총탄에 맞은 흔적이 그대로 남아있었다고 현지 언론들은 전했다. 전문가들은 죽은 아무르 호랑이가 3∼5세의 암컷이었을 것이라고 추정했다. 이 남성은 현재 혐의를 부인하는 것으로 알려졌다. 그러나 유죄로 인정되면 최대 징역 4년 형을 선고받을 수 있다고 인테르팍스는 보도했다. 서식지 파괴와 무분별한 밀렵으로 멸종 위기에 처한 아무르 호랑이는 현재 국제자연보전연맹(IUCN)의 '적색목록'에 지정돼 국제적인 보호를 받고 있다. 아무르 호랑이는 지구상에서 가장 큰 호랑이 종으로 알려져 있다. 아무르 호랑이의 개체 수는 560∼600마리에 불과하며 이 중 90%가 러시아 연해주와 하바롭스크주 일대에서 서식한다.

"'Hallyu' tourists spent $1,007 on average in 2019, BTS most favored: report",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2368387,2020.07.16 10:23,"Foreigners who traveled to South Korea last year to consume K-pop goods and content were estimated to have spent $1,007 on average, according to a report Thursday. In its latest tourism industry analysis report, the state-run Korea Tourism Organization (KTO) estimated that some 1.11 million foreigners came to South Korea in 2019 to specifically consume goods and experiences related to ""hallyu,"" a term referring to the global popularity of Korean pop culture, last year. On average, $302 was spent on general shopping, $184 on lodging, $155 on food and $138 on hallyu-related spending, according to the KTO report. K-pop was considered the biggest factor when it came to drawing overseas hallyu tourists to South Korea, according to the report. In an online popularity survey conducted by KTO on some 12,000 overseas K-pop fans in August-September of last year, BTS was the most popular, winning 36.1 percent of votes. EXO and Super Junior came in second and third, with 10.4 percent and 8.2 percent, respectively. BIGBANG and SHINHWA rounded out the top five, with 5.6 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Female soloist IU reached No. 6, while girl groups Girls' Generation and TWICE landed at the seventh and eighth spots, respectively.

A decade of celebs chasing each other,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2361959,2020.07.12 15:42,"“Running Man” marked its 10th anniversary on Sunday, becoming SBS’ longest-running variety show. A game program where celebrities chase each other and snatch their opponents’ name tags, it is one of the most popular South Korean TV shows in Korea as well as abroad. Kicking off as a segment on the SBS reality show “Good Sunday” on July 11, 2010, “Running Man” became its own show in March 2017 when “Good Sunday” came to a close. The variety program is the third-longest-running Korean TV show in history, the first being the KBS talk show “Happy Sunday” and the second the MBC variety show “Infinite Challenge,” which respectively spent 17 years and 13 years on the air. “Running Man” ranked among Koreans’ top 10 TV shows from 2013 to July 2019, according to Gallup Korea, and enjoys a wide fandom overseas. When “Running Man” kicked off, there were similar entertainment programs on other channels. While those shows were set in rural areas, “Running Man” declared that it would host an urban chase where the participants would run around and engage physically with each other. “Running Man” took its chases to other Asian countries, where it became hugely popular. Then it was localized and exported to nine countries including China, Japan, Singapore and Indonesia. “Running Man” was not without troubles. It hit a low point in the second half of 2016 after its main producers moved to the show’s Chinese production. The sudden departure of rapper Gary, who had been a regular member of the cast for six years, in October that year brought about the biggest crisis for the show. While the show was expected to fold in February 2017, the addition of new members Jeon So-min and Yang Se-chan in 2017 helped revive it. Comedian Yoo Jae-suk, one of the original cast members, has been credited with bringing out the best in everyone and keeping the show going. Yoo’s efforts paid off, and he won the grand prize at the SBS Entertainment Awards in December. He won the same prize in 2012 and 2011, also for “Running Man.” Viewers appreciate the timely and creative selection of guests on “Running Man.” From actors to athletes, from rookies to big names, “Running Man” balanced the chemistry between its regular members and guests, sometimes scouting popular guests as regulars, as in the case of Jeon and Yang. According to SBS, the viewership ratings hit their peak on June 3, 2012, when soccer star Park Ji-sung and singer-actor IU appeared on the show. To mark its 10th anniversary, “Running Man” hosted its first live show with all eight regular members on Sunday.

According to production agency Credia’s announcement Thursday, Kim will perform Aug. 15 at the Lotte Concert Hall in Jamsil, eastern Seoul. Kim, whose repertoire encompasses jazz, new age and classical music and whose work is often featured in films and dramas, graduated from the Berklee College of Music and has worked with numerous K-pop musicians such as Yoon Jong-shin and IU. The upcoming show will mark his first solo recital since 2017, when he released his sixth album. Kim will present his staple works from “Rainy Day” to “Homeland Eternal.” The concert is part of Credia’s “Summer Breeze” series. The following day, cellist Hong Jin-ho will hold a recital at the same venue. Hong is recognized for his participation in the JTBC audition show “Super Band” last year. Though he mainly performs classical music, Hong also works with rock musicians as a member of Hoppipolla, an alternative rock band created through the TV show. At the concert, Hong will collaborate with musicians playing diverse instruments from the violin, the piano and string instruments to the bandoneon, showcasing different styles of music. Tickets for both performances will open Friday. Ticket prices range from 40,000 won to 110,000 won ($33 to $91) for Kim’s recital and from 30,000 won to 80,000 won for Hong’s.

Remake of ‘Hotel del Luna’ coming to the US,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2347701,2020.06.24 13:09,"Last year’s popular drama “Hotel Del Luna” will be remade into a US television series. Studio Dragon, the maker of the drama, which recently opened a US branch, announced a collaboration with Skydance TV on Wednesday to plan and produce the US remake. Skydance TV is the production company behind “Terminator: Dark Fate,” “6 Underground” and “Mission: Impossible – Fallout,” among others. This is the first time a Korean studio will be working with a US production company on equal standing in creating a scripted show. Alison Schapker, one of the producers of the Netflix series “Altered Carbon,” will be developing and producing the remake. “We are excited to be partnering with Alison and Studio Dragon to bring this timeless story to a global audience,” said Bill Bost, Skydance TV president. “Hotel Del Luna” revolves around an elite hotel manager and his boss, played by singer-actress IU in the original series, running a hotel for spirits. It was the highest rated tvN drama series in 2019. “We believe ‘Hotel Del Luna’ will enhance the reputation of Korean storytelling around the world by showcasing the global appeal of our local stories,” said Park Hyun, head of Studio Dragon’s global division.

Tougher regulations eyed to stop S. Korean boats' illegal fishing overseas,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2335468,2020.06.15 09:20,"South Korea said Monday it will revamp its regulations to prevent possible illegal fishing activities by South Korean-flagged boats operating overseas, after the country had been on the verge of being labeled as one of the nations engaging in unregulated fishing. Previously, inspections had been carried out for illegal fishing activities only on foreign-flagged boats arriving in South Korea. The new measure will be implemented on the first batch of 12 deep-sea squid fishing boats in July, according to the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. In September 2019, the US made a preliminary decision to name South Korea as a country that engages in illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, after a South Korean boat was caught doing unauthorized fishing near the Antarctic. The decision was later lifted in January, but South Korea has been making efforts to bolster its control over illegal fishing activities to prevent similar incidents from recurring. The European Union made a similar decision on South Korea in 2013, which was lifted in 2015. Local authorities plan to especially beef up surveillance on poaching of banned marine creatures, such as sharks and whales, by South Korean boats. The ministry said it will also hand out official maps of the exclusive economic zones for fishing boats to prevent potential conflicts on waters. For fishing boats without an authorized fisheries observer on board, the ministry plans to monitor their activities through video surveillance systems.

"IU, Suga's collaboration song 'Eight' becomes chart sensation",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2302779,2020.05.07 11:16,"Topping iTunes singles charts in 59 countries and territories Thursday, ""Eight,"" a high-profile collaboration song between K-pop queen IU and BTS' Suga, became a chart sensation. Following its official release Wednesday evening, ""Eight,"" a pop rock number, topped the iTunes singles chart in the United States, France, Singapore, New Zealand, Finland, Malaysia, the Philippines and 52 other countries and regions as of early Thursday, according to Edam Entertainment, the agency of IU. The song also topped major local real-time music charts immediately after its release up till early Thursday, including Melon, Genie Music and Bugs!, proving the collaboration power of the two K-pop talents. IU and Suga, of the same age 28 (Korean age), teamed up to tell the story of youthful experiences and sentiment through the powerful, breezy collaboration song. Its title was taken from the last digit of their age. Suga also contributed his voice to the recording of ""Eight,"" adding a trendy layer of rap over IU's vocals.

IU drops collaboration single with BTS’ Suga,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2302299,2020.05.06 19:08,"Ready to reign K-pop charts, IU’s new single “Eight,” featuring Suga of BTS, was released Wednesday evening. The much-anticipated song has been co-written and composed by the singer-songwriter and the BTS member, who’s not only served as a producer but also lent his vocal for the track. Its title refers to the age of the two musicians, as both are 28 (Korean age). “As musicians of the same age, the two singers could relate to one another and create their own unique synergy in the song,” said IU’s agency EDAM Entertainment in a released statement. “Eight” follows IU’s 2019 EP “Love Poem.” The uplifting song, which flourishes on nostalgic pop-rock band sound, blends IU’s soaring vocal with Suga’s soothing rapping. IU explained that the self-reflective song continues the legacy of her age-themed songs such as “Twenty-three” and “Palette.” ""If the previous songs used to take a form of an ‘essay’ through which I directly talked to listeners, ‘Eight’ is like a short novel that confesses my life as a 28-years-old by using a virtual figure and various metaphors,” wrote the singer in an introduction for “Eight.” “While I’m not sure whether it’s from my personal emotion or from the overall social atmosphere coming from the disaster, my 28 would be remembered by the recurring feeling of lethargy and longing for the ‘orange island’ where we felt freedom rather than sadness.” Part of the song’s lyric reads, “Under the orange sun we dance together without shadows / There’s no such thing as a decided goodbye / Let’s meet on that beautiful memory.” In a lead up to the song’s release, Suga also shared on his broadcast channel that the production process with IU has been very smooth, saying, “There wasn’t a lot of back-and-forth. Shortly after I sent the (song’s) beats to her, she sent it back with the melody.” He also added that he’s been listening to the song quite often after finishing working on it, while he rarely listens to the songs he’s worked on after they are completed. The musicians have pretty much kept the song in mystery, raising K-pop listeners’ expectations over the last few days. They’ve only released few teaser contents, including a cryptic teaser video featuring IU in a futuristic setting. The song’s accompanying music video switches between an animation and scenes featuring IU, where she walks into a futuristic room and puts herself into a trance to travel various phases of her life. One of the most popular singer-actors, IU has scored multiple chart-toppers throughout her over a decade-long career, carving out her own niche in the small-screen as well. Most recently, she dropped “Give You My Heart” for the soundtrack of Korean hit drama “Crash Landing On You.” This is not the first time that Suga, whose stage name is Agust D, has proved his producing prowess. He’s previously produced songs like “Song Request” by Lee So-ra, “Wine” by Suran, “We Don’t Talk Together” by Heize, as well as several numbers for BTS such as “Boyz with Fun” and “Ddaeng.” The BTS rapper is reportedly working on the group’s upcoming album.

Star-studded collaboration projects dazzle K-pop scene,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2295550,2020.04.29 15:43,"In one of the highest-profile music collaboration projects to date in South Korea, female singer-songwriter IU and Suga of BTS are on course to hit the music scene with their collaboration song next week. ""Eight,"" set for release next Wednesday, was jointly created by the K-pop queen and actress and the rapper from BTS, and comes with a rap part by the latter. The collaboration brings together the musical power of IU, arguably the country's most sought-after artist for music collaboration of today, with the glamour and talent of Suga from one of the most popular music bands in the world. Two teaser images of the digital single, released by IU's management agency Edam Entertainment, zoom in on IU's hands in two different conditions -- set aside and uncared for as opposed to jeweled and brought to attention -- against the ivory and orange-colored backdrops, subtly alluding to the upcoming song's dreamy vibes. The song reportedly deviates from the music styles the artists have explored so far, adding a new line of musical work to their repertoires. The joint project is the latest in a series of similar star-studded collaboration works the K-pop scene has spawned recently, a phenomenon that comes as the K-pop industry is struggling to shake off the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, another high-profile collaboration song, ""Refresh,"" brought together Zico and Kang Daniel, two of the hottest male solos in today's K-pop music scene. Zico, a rapper and producer who dominated local music charts for weeks with ""Any Song"" earlier this year, also teamed up with American DJ Steve Aoki to produce the song under a joint campaign between American beverage maker PepsiCo, Inc. and Korean music label Starship Entertainment. The Zico-Kang duo cut a glamorous sight in the song's music video promoting Korean aesthetics, appearing in traditional Korean overcoats against the backdrop of Korean heritage assets, such as the Korean writing system Hangeul, the traditional Korean house ""hanok"" and Korean performing arts. Also last week, the K-pop scene welcomed in an unprecedented collaboration coupling rapper and producer Tiger JK with Pengsoo, a wildly popular penguin character created by the national education broadcasting channel EBS. The simple, humorous yodel-inspired hip-hop song, ""This is Pengsoo,"" topped several real-time music charts last week, including Genie Music, becoming an immediate hit. Adding to the growing roll of A-list collaboration projects, Shofar Music said Wednesday its artist Bolbbalgan4 will unveil a collaboration song featuring K-pop phenomenon EXO's member Baekhyun. ""Butterfly and Cat,"" a track from Bolbbalgan4's upcoming album, will be prereleased on May 7 ahead of the album's official release schedule for May 13, the agency said. This marks the first music release by the flourishing female singer, featuring a fellow K-pop artist.

"""인간이 부추긴 대멸종시대…신종 바이러스도 활개""",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2279838,2020.04.08 16:11,"수렵, 농경, 도시 건설 등 생물다양성을 해치는 인간 활동 때문에 신종 코로나바이러스 감염증(코로나19)과 같은 인수공통감염병의 위험이 커졌다는 연구 결과가 나왔다. 지구가 6차 대멸종기에 돌입했다는 평가가 나올 정도의 자원 착취 속에서 인간과 서식지를 잃은 야생동물의 접촉이 늘어남에 따라 '괴질'이 인간사회에 창궐할 보건 위험이 커졌다는 진단이다. 7일(현지시간) 영국 가디언에 따르면 호주, 미국 연구진은 코로나19 팬데믹(세계적 대유행)도 이러한 현상의 일부라는 내용을 담은 논문을 영국 생물학 학술지 왕립학회보B에 게재했다. 연구진은 짐승들이 인간에게 옮긴 것으로 알려진 바이러스 142종을 골라 세계자연보전연맹(IUCN)의 멸종위기 보고서인 '적색목록'과 비교해 어떤 동물이 인간과 얼마만큼 바이러스를 공유하는지 집계했다. 그 결과 예상대로 소, 양, 개, 염소 등 가축들이 가장 많은 종류의 바이러스를 인간과 공유했고 그 수치는 야생 포유류의 8배에 달했다. 설치류, 박쥐류, 영장류 등 주택, 농장 근처에서 인간과 더불어 살아가는 동물들도 조사대상 가운데 75% 정도에 달하는 바이러스의 숙주인 것으로 나타났다. 박쥐류는 단독으로 사스(SARS·중증급성호흡기증후군), 니파, 마르부르크, 에볼라 등 질병과 관련된 것으로 조사됐다. 연구진은 인간에게 새로 전이되는 바이러스에 노출될 위험은 수렵, 야생동물 거래, 서식지 파괴 때문에 개체수가 감소한 멸종위기 야생동물들에서 가장 크다고 평가했다. 연구진은 생물다양성이 높은 오지에 인간이 침입해 인간이나 주변 동물과 야생동물의 새로운 접촉이 이뤄지면서 신종 바이러스 감염증이 인간에게 전이될 위험이 증가한다는 결론을 내렸다. 이번 논문의 주저자인 원헬스 연구소의 크리스틴 크뤼더 존슨은 ""바이러스가 동물로부터 인간에게 전이되는 것은 야생동물, 그들의 서식처와 관련한 인간활동의 직접적 결과""라고 지적했다. 존슨은 ""그런 활동 때문에 인간이 야생동물들과 바이러스를 공유하는 대가를 치른다""며 ""생물종의 생존과 바이러스 전파 위험이 동시에 커지고 여러 요소가 결합해 현재와 같은 혼란(코로나19 사태)이 닥치는 것'이라고 설명했다. 이날 논문과는 별개로 코로나19 창궐을 계기로 야생동물 생존권 문제가 인간의 보건 문제와 직결된다는 인식은 점점 공감대를 넓혀가고 있다. 세계 야생동물단체 200여곳은 이날 세계보건기구(WHO)에 서한을 보내 살아있는 야생동물을 사고파는 시장, 야생동물을 전통 약재로 쓰는 행위를 금지하도록 각국에 권고하라고 촉구했다. 이번 서한 발송에는 국제동물애호기금(IFAW), 런던동물원, 동물의 윤리적인 대우를 바라는 사람들(PETA) 등이 참여했다. 이들 단체는 전 세계에서 연간 20억명이 넘는 사람이 에볼라, 메르스(중동호흡기증후군), 인간면역결핍바이러스(HIV) 감염증, 소결핵증, 광견병, 렙토스피라증 등 짐승이 옮기는 질병에 걸리고 그 가운데 200만명이 넘는 이들이 숨진다고 강조했다. 특히 이들은 이번 코로나19 팬데믹도 중국 야생동물 시장(중국 후베이성 우한의 화난 수산시장)에서 시작된 것으로 보인다며 사람과 야생동물이 가까이 다가간 결과로 인간이 짐승의 병을 옮았다고 주장했다.

IU previously modeled for Chamisul for four years, from 2014 to 2018. “IU is popular and has considerable stature as a singer and actor, and her unique ‘clean’ image (presented as a TV personality), goes along well with the brand,” HiteJinro said. The brand’s IU ads differed from the industry norm when she was first chosen, as most liquor brands chose to associate their products with a “sexy” image, the company explained. Meanwhile, legislation is underway that would prohibit the use of celebrity pictures on bottles of alcoholic beverages. The Ministry of Health and Welfare has been working to issue a notice that it intends to revise the National Health Promotion Act to prohibit such marketing tactics, amid rising concerns that they encourage drinking. A ministry official told The Korea Herald that the notice about the legislation, which has been delayed due to the coronavirus outbreak, will be issued around the end of March. Rep. Nam In-soon of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea also proposed a change to the law in December 2019 that would add a new article banning celebrities from endorsing alcohol.

Pangolin identified as potential link for coronavirus spread,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2225096,2020.02.07 21:51,"BEIJING (AFP) -- The endangered pangolin may be the link that facilitated the spread of the novel coronavirus across China, Chinese scientists said Friday. Researchers have long suspected that the virus, which has now killed more than 630 people and infected some 31,000, was passed from an animal to a human at a market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. Researchers at the South China Agricultural University have identified the scaly mammal as a “potential intermediate host,” the university said in a statement, without providing further details. The new virus is believed to have originated in bats, but researchers have suggested there could have been an “intermediate host” in the transmission to humans. After testing more than 1,000 samples from wild animals, scientists from the university found the genome sequences of viruses found on pangolins to be 99 percent identical to those on coronavirus patients, the official Xinhua news agency reported. The pangolin is considered the most trafficked animal on the planet and more than one million have been snatched from Asian and African forests in the past decade, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). They are destined for markets in China and Vietnam, where their scales are used in traditional medicine -- despite having no medical benefits -- and their meat is bought on the black market. Shadowy wildlife trade Experts on Friday called for the Chinese scientists to release more data from their research. Simply reporting the similarity between the genome sequences of viruses is “not sufficient,” said James Wood, a veterinary medicine professor at the University of Cambridge. Wood said the results could have been caused by “contamination from a highly infected environment.” “We would need to see all of the genetic data to get a feel for how related the human and pangolin viruses are,” Jonathan Bell, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said. China in January ordered a temporary ban on the trade in wild animals until the epidemic is under control. The country has long been accused by conservationists of tolerating a shadowy trade in endangered animals for food or as ingredients in traditional medicines. “If we want to do everything in our power to prevent deadly disease outbreaks such as coronavirus, then a permanent ban on wildlife trade, in China, and around the world, is the only solution,” said Neil D‘Cruze, global head of wildlife research at World Animal Protection. A price list that circulated on China’s internet for a business at the Wuhan market showed a menagerie of animals or animal-based products including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game -- 112 items in all. The SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus that killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in 2002-03 also has been traced to wild animals, with scientists saying it likely originated in bats, later reaching humans via civets. “Working to end the trade in wildlife can help to resolve some of the longer-term risks associated with animal reservoirs of zoonoses,” Wood said, referring to infectious diseases that can be passed between animals and humans.

US lifts preliminary designation of S. Korea as illegal fishing country,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2212538,2020.01.22 20:56,"The United States has cancelled its preliminary designation of South Korea as a country that engages in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, lifting concerns of possible sanctions, the oceans ministry said Wednesday. In September, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) made the preliminary decision as it identified South Korea as ""failing to apply sufficient sanctions to deter its vessels from engaging in fishing activities that violate conservation and management measures adopted by"" the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). NOAA raised question over South Korea's lack of efforts to forfeit unlawfully-raised profits earned by the problematic boats in March. It demanded the Seoul government adopt tougher regulations. The decision came after two South Korean fishing boats failed to comply with CCAMLR regulations while operating near Antarctica in 2017. South Korea was designated as a preliminary IUU fishing country for the second time after the European Union made a similar decision in 2013, which was lifted in 2015. The preliminary decision had no impact on the South Korean fishing industry in the past four months as fishing boats have been allowed to maintain their operations without new restrictions. If a nation is confirmed to be an IUU nation, it is banned from shipping fishery goods to the US. (Yonhap)",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2020/01/22/20200122000793_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

Playlist: 10 relaxing IU songs to keep you warm this winter,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2160587,2019.12.05 16:40,"The nippy winter is in full swing -- time to take out the cozy essentials like a fuzzy blanket, padded coat and, most importantly, a renewed winter playlist. And just in time, K-pop fans have recently been treated to a new album from IU, whose sweet, comforting vocals make her one of the most sought-after acts this time of the season. While the chart-topping singer-songwriter is beloved regardless of the weather, many of her emotional ballads have especially served as a remedy for winter blues, all the more for their poetic lyrics and her sophisticated delivery. Celebrating her return with the sweeping “Love Poem” album, here are 10 relaxing songs by IU that will keep you company on a winter night. 1. “Love Poem” (2019) Preceded by the release of IU’s latest “Love Poem” EP, the song is a warm ode to those struggling with life out there. Kicking off with somber piano chords, this sentimental ballad slowly swells into emotional richness that evokes a whirlwind of feelings. Its soul-stirring melody strikes a balance between sadness and darkness, but IU makes sure to heal wounded hearts by belting out, “Take a deep breath. I’ll sing for you who has forgotten how to cry out loud” in the refrain. The “Love Poem” EP had been delayed from its original release following the death of singer and actress Sulli, a close friend of IU. 2. “Dear Name” (2017) One of the double titles from IU’s popular “Palette” album, the evocative ballad begins with a gentle piano-and-string croon that climaxes into a breathtaking belt session where IU’s vocal prowess truly shines. Co-written by the singer herself and composer Kim Ee-na, the song “is a story of all of us, a song of consolation and reconciliation for everyone,” to quote IU, with its heartwarming lyrics addressing that all the “names” worldwide deserve to be known. IU performed the song at the 2017 Melon Music Awards with lesser-known aspiring musicians to better deliver the song’s message. 3. “Ending Scene” (2017) Also released on the singer’s “Palette” album, this fan-favorite stirring ballad, composed by singer-songwriter Sam Kim, details a post-breakup feeling. Smoothly escalating from IU’s sophisticated, narration-like vocals, the song soars into an impassioned refrain where IU hopes a lover finds someone that loves him as much as he loves himself. The song was covered by a number of fellow musicians, including BTS’ Jungkook and Paul Kim. 4. “Through the Night” (2017) This soft folk-ballad is one of IU’s most critical hits, speaking to her impressive songwriting skill. The self-written song portrays a woman who pens a heartfelt letter for her lover one peaceful summer night. Minimalized on instruments -- majorly led by acoustic guitar -- the song shimmers on her velvety vocals and poetic lyrics, receiving kudos from many music critics. The award-winning song has also appealed widely to the public for its comforting feelings, a key to its long-lasting success on the charts. IU once named “Through the Night” as one of her most representative songs, saying, “I wish people could remember this song after I die.” 5. “Knees” (2015) Providing listeners a home-like sense of comfort, “Knees” is soothing and calming to the heart. Composed and penned by IU, the singer reportedly wrote the song when she struggled with insomnia, missing her grandmother who used to put her to bed when she was young. Led by a simple piano chord, the song is beloved by many fans for its lullaby-like melody and nostalgic lyrics, praised as “one of the best songs to listen to on sleepless nights.” 6. “Only I Didn’t Know” (2011) From its heart-wrenching lyrics to saccharine melody, this tear-jerking ballad is the ultimate breakup anthem. Composed by renowned composer Yoon Sang and written by lyricist Kim Ee-na, the song has completely altered IU’s girl-next-door image from her breakout hit “Good Day” into a maturing artist on her own. The singer’s meticulous delivery of the song was also highly praised given that she was only 18 years old when she promoted it. 7. “Seeking for a Star” (2011) Composed by veteran singer-songwriter Kim Kwang-jin, this orchestral ballad released on IU’s “Last Fantasy” album sounds like a beautiful poem. Lyrically, it’s about missing someone she once loved before but can’t see anymore, equating that person to “a star in my heart.” Its highlight comes when the singer’s soaring vocals are paired with the mellifluous chorus done by Kim, who participated in the song to add a whole other layer. 8. “The First Breakup, That Night” (2010) This one’s not a typical breakup ballad. Composed and penned by singer-songwriter Yoon Jong-shin, its lyrics that crudely depict post-breakup feelings are easily relatable, while its melody that vacillates between melancholy and saccharine creates mixed feelings. The song, which was released on IU’s iconic “Real” EP, has been overshadowed by the album’s infamous “Good Day,” but it is another hidden gem that deserves better recognition. 9. “Riding on a Train” (2009) Part of her early discography, “Riding on a Train” may sound like a classical production due to its easy-on-the-ear melody, but fans still choose it as one of IU’s best works that they put on repeat. Lyrically, IU sings about how she hopes to leave behind lingering breakup pains and memories by hopping on a train. It’s been nearly a decade since its release, but this polished ballad never gets old. 10. “Lost Child” (2008) It may come as a surprise that IU was only 15 years old when she debuted with “Lost Child,” an intensive ballad track that embraces a darker side of the singer. The song failed to make a splash at the time, which proved difficult for IU in her early days, but the mature vocal styling and emotional expression made it an underappreciated work that has only recently resurfaced as an early masterpiece by the singer.

US welcomes passage of S. Korean bill aimed at fighting illegal fishing,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2143348,2019.11.02 15:11,"The office of the US Trade Representative has welcomed the parliamentary passage of a South Korean bill designed to combat illegal fishing and lauded Seoul's efforts to deter illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. The National Assembly passed an amendment to the country's distant water fisheries development act Thursday after the United States made a preliminary decision in September to designate South Korea as an IUU fishing country. On Friday, the USTR issued a statement welcoming the passage of the act. ""We commend Korea for acting expeditiously to strengthen its regime to combat illegal fishing, which disadvantages law-abiding fishermen everywhere,"" said US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. After the designation, the USTR called for Seoul's trade ministry to hold environment consultations under a Korea-US free trade agreement. The oceans ministry, meanwhile, said it has kicked off the process to obtain the delisting of Seoul from illegal fishing country status by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""The USTR is not an agency that has authority to remove the status, but we will do our best to obtain the delisting at an early date, regarding the USTR's message as a promising sign,"" a government official said.

S. Korea named illegal fishing country by US,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2104127,2019.09.20 09:29,"The United States made a preliminary decision on Thursday to designate South Korea as a country that engages in illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, calling on Asia's fourth-largest economy to adopt tougher regulations. In a biennial report to Congress, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it is identifying South Korea for ""failing to apply sufficient sanctions to deter its vessels from engaging in fishing activities that violate conservation and management measures adopted by"" the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. ""The Republic of Korea committed to amending its domestic law to ensure that appropriate mechanisms exist for taking appropriate corrective actions in future cases,"" it said. To address the matter, the office of the US Trade Representative said in a press release that it plans to seek environment consultations with Seoul under the environment chapter of the two countries' bilateral free trade agreement. The move came after two South Korean fishing boats failed to comply with regulations of the CCAMLR while operating near Antarctica in 2017, according to Seoul's oceans ministry. It marks the second time for South Korea to be designated as a preliminary IUU fishing country after the European Union made a similar decision in 2013, which was lifted in 2015. The two South Korean boats continued their operations even after the CCAMLR notified them of the closure of the fishing grounds. One of the boats, Hongjin 701, claimed that it did not receive the alert as it was blocked as spam, while the other, Southern Ocean, deliberately ignored the message. Hongjin 701 was later cleared of charges, and Southern Ocean received a suspension of indictment in 2018, only to receive an operation ban of 60 days. Both ships did not receive criminal punishments. South Korea has been applying tougher regulations on overseas fishing after being designated as an IUU country in 2013, fining violators 1 billion won ($823,000). NOAA raised a question over South Korea's lack of efforts to forfeit unlawfully-raised profits earned by the problematic boats in March. Responding to the US claim, the ocean ministry in Seoul said it plans to make legal grounds to confiscate any profits raised from illegal operations. South Korea also vowed to implement ""zero-tolerance"" polices on local fishing boats. Last month, the US acknowledged that South Korea has been making notable progress in improving its regulations, but the preliminary designation was inevitable, citing a ""matter of timing,"" the ministry official added. Last month, the US also agreed to lift the preliminary decision for South Korea, even before the publication of its next report in 2021, if the South Korean parliament passes a revised bill that would strengthen punishments for illegal fishing, according to the ministry. Currently, illegal fishing in distant waters is an offense that carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison or fines of between 1 billion won ($837,000) and up to five times the value of the marine products. In July, a ruling party lawmaker submitted a revised bill of the Distant Water Fisheries Development Act that would create a penalty clause for violators. The preliminary decision will have no direct impact on the local fishing industry for the time being, according to the ministry, which claimed that local fishing boats will still be allowed to maintain their operations without new restrictions. If South Korea is confirmed to be an IUU nation, however, the country will be banned from shipping fishery goods to the US.

[Herald Review] ‘Hotel Del Luna’ wins over viewers with spooky romance,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2059566,2019.07.29 15:58,"TvN’s Saturday-Sunday drama “Hotel Del Luna” recorded its highest viewership rating over the weekend with Sunday’s episode peaking at 9.7 percent with an average viewership rating of 8.7 percent. The numbers are higher than the ratings peak for “Arthdal Chronicles,” that was shown in the same slot, which was at 7.7 percent. Initial expectations had not been too high, as the drama was scheduled to air between the second and the third part of “Arthdal Chronicles,” a blockbuster production with a reported budget of 54 billion won ($45.7 million). Star scriptwriter pair Hong Jung-eun and Hong Mi-ran, widely known as Hong sisters, had a tough time with recent productions “Warm and Cozy” (2015) and “Hwayugi” (2017). “Hotel Del Luna” is the sisters’ 12th co-production. The casting also left many in doubt. Though IU, 26, has been on a winning streak with her choice of dramas, including “My Mister” (2018), Yeo Jin-goo, 22, has had his ups and downs. The storyline evolves around Jang Man-wol (IU), the owner of Hotel Del Luna, a hotel for spirits who have just died. Cursed with living forever, she hires the unwilling Goo Chan-sung (Yeo Jin-goo) to manage the hotel, gifting him with the ability to communicate with sprits. At the hotel, Goo sees to it that guests feel comforted, satisfying their unfulfilled desires in life. Some evil spirits are ready to take control of the weak-hearted Goo, but Jang always shows up to save him. It was the first time that IU has partnered with a younger, less-experienced male actor. The relationship between the two is the reverse of what viewers saw in “Guardian: The Lonely and Great God” (2016-2017). In that drama, the female lead (Kim Go-eun) was the delicate human-being who sees ghosts and the almighty male lead (Gong Yoo) protects her no matter what. Jang and Goo’s relationship works the other way around. As Jang, IU exhibits a sense of eternal loneliness hidden beneath a cranky and grumpy temper. Her stylish outfits are also a draw. Her mostly retro-style looks, include dramatic wide brim hats and long draped silk skirts. The Hong sisters have been famous for their charming female characters, creating memorable lead roles for Han Ye-seul in “Couple or Trouble” (2006), Shin Min-a in “My Girlfriend is a Gumiho” (2010) and Gong Hyo-jin in “Master’s Sun” (2013). It seems like IU is about to take up the baton. Yeo, on the other hand, is an actor who has been working hard to shake off the image he developed as a child actor. His acting had been somewhat stiff at the beginning, trying too hard, perhaps. But as the story develops, he has been blending in with the whole picture. On Sunday, Jang realizes she has fallen in love with Goo and wonders whether Goo is a reincarnation of her past lover. The 16-episode airs at 9 p.m. on cable channel tvN.

"[Kundhavi Kadiresan] Go fish! -- But, please, do so legally",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2015718,2019.06.04 17:27,"The people of South Korea love fish and both demand and consumption of fish are on the rise. On the one hand that’s good, because fish is high in protein and low in fat and that helps to feed a hungry world while providing livelihoods for hundreds of millions of people across the Asia-Pacific region. But this increase in demand has also created opportunities for criminals to make a profit. While most of the Asia-Pacific fishing fleets operate within the rules, some $5 billion worth of fish is caught either illegally, has not been reported or the fishing boats are operating in an unregulated environment -- referred to collectively as IUU. That’s bad news on a number of levels. While IUU fishing is a global problem, the situation is disproportionately worse here in our region because Asia and the Pacific produce 75 percent of the world’s seafood, and because IUU fishers target countries with poorly developed economies and regulations that are also home to some of the most vulnerable communities. Of course IUU fishing leads to overexploitation of fish stocks and has a devastating impact on biodiversity and habitat. But it also hits honest fishers and communities dependent upon them right in the pocket. That includes buyers, sellers and legitimate industrial operations. In fact, evidence is mounting that IUU fishing is often associated with other transnational crimes too, including the exploitation of migrant workers enduring slave-like conditions on fishing boats at sea. In short, IUU fishing is a widespread and persistent problem across the Asia-Pacific region and resolving it will require long-term and unified regional commitment. 　A good day’s catch -- reeling in bad guys 　The good news is that many countries have now recognized the need to take action on IUU and are doing so. Many, including South Korea, have signed up to the Port State Measures Agreement, a legally binding treaty that operates as a giant worldwide net that’s closing in around IUU fishers. Introduced by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization in 2009, the PSMA was the first international agreement to set minimum standards for countries to prevent IUU seafood products from entering ports. Now fully enforceable, it provides a regulatory framework for countries to refuse entry of vessels suspected of participating or facilitating IUU fishing activities and allows for enforced inspection of vessels if entry is granted. Once a fishing boat is identified as operating in contravention of the PSMA, the information can be shared with the maritime and fishing authorities of other countries -- making it that much more difficult for that particular boat and its captain to continue profiting from IUU fishing. The effectiveness of this instrument in the region is clear, with vessels being seized and prosecuted by countries that have acceded to the PSMA. Thailand and Indonesia are two such examples. So far, 19 countries and territories in the Asia-Pacific region have acceded to the PSMA and several more are in the process of doing so. The PSMA is complemented by other regional initiatives that are setting seafood traceability standards so that buyers of seafood from the Asia-Pacific region can be guaranteed that the product does not come from IUU fishing practices. Such guarantees are opening international markets for products from Asia and the Pacific. However, while real and rapid progress is being made in Asia and the Pacific to reduce illegal fishing, there is still much to be done to eliminate misreporting or nonreporting of catch. The rapid advancement of access to telecommunications in the Asia-Pacific region has provided an infrastructure for the adoption of digital tools for reporting of catch. The immediate challenge is to empower fishers to adopt this technology downstream. 　Boats on water, boots on ground 　Upstream, the region now has seven state-of-the-art fisheries and surveillance centers that utilize high-tech equipment to identify vessels suspected of engaging in IUU practices. The establishment of national centers in Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Thailand and the US, in conjunction with the regional surveillance center for the western Pacific in the Solomon Islands, has increased the capacity for cohesion and collaboration among Asia-Pacific neighbors to tackle IUU fishing. Further developing efficient and effective monitoring and surveillance technologies, rewarding honest fishers (including small-scale fishers) for accurately reporting all catch (through enhanced market access), and building capacity of port states to detect and prosecute IUU fishers are clear steps for eliminating IUU fishing. Accession by all Asia-Pacific countries to the PSMA will send a loud and clear message to those involved in, or considering, IUU fishing that we’re onto them. June 5 is International Day for the Fight against IUU Fishing, and it serves as a timely reminder of the tasks at hand. There has never been a better time for the countries of the Asia-Pacific region to expand their efforts to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. That time is now.

BTS, Red Velvet and Shinee’s Jonghyun were especially recognized atop the lists. Billboard picked BTS’ “Love Yourself: Answer” as the best K-pop album of the year. “BTS has risen to the top of the global music industry,” commentary accompanying the list read. “They released their ‘Love Yourself’ album series, through which the group weaved a thematic discovery of self-love.” Following a thorough analysis of the album, Billboard praised it, saying “Though some may feel it’s a lot to ask of pop music to have substance as well as style, BTS’ ‘Love Yourself: Answer’ lacks in neither regard.” Jonghyun’s posthumous “Poet/Artist” album followed on the best albums list in the No. 2 spot. The lead vocalist of SHINee died in December last year. Billboard described Jonghyun as a “beloved singer, songwriter and producer” with incredible talents. “While it may be a tough listen for fans, the album is a beautiful, telling snapshot of the artist and poet Jonghyun was, and will continue to be for so many around the world,” it said. Sunmi’s “Warming,” Heize’s “Wish & Wind” and EXO’s “Don’t Mess Up My Tempo” rounded out the top five albums. Red Velvet’s “Bad Boy” topped the list as best K-pop song. “This standout track fleshed out the second half of the act’s identity through its lush soundscape and vivid accompanying music video, which positioned the quintet as confident femme fatales,” Billboard said. It described the song as one of the year’s “most pristine production to date.” Pentagon’s “Shine,” BTS’ “Fake Love” and IU’s “BBI BBI” followed on the list.

Harry and Meghan step out in matching skirts in Tonga,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1822047,2018.10.26 13:57,"Prince Harry and wife Meghan donned matching red and cream unisex skirts Friday as they wrapped up a four-day Pacific island trip in Tonga with a celebration of local crafts and culture. The emphasis has been on Meghan's fashion choices during her first international tour since marrying into the British royals last May, but Harry cut a dash with a tasselled skirt worn over the outside of his suit. Pregnant Meghan wore an identical garment high on the waist, covering her baby bump, as the pair toured a craft market in the island kingdom's capital Nuku'alofa. The traditional skirts are a status symbol worn during formal occasions by both men and women in Tonga. The warm welcome received by the royal couple during their travels in Tonga and Fiji this week continued, with local Iunisi Fotofili struggling to express her feelings at being in Meghan's presence. ""I'm very happy. Excited. I don't know if when I see them, I will cry, or be like... I just want to run to her and hug her."" Crowds turned out in their thousands in Fiji and Tonga, eclipsing the numbers seen on the first week of the couple's Oceania tour in Australia. American-born Meghan wore a green-and-white striped cotton dress by Australian designer Martin Grant to tour the markets and meet Prime Minister Akilisi Pohiva. She changed to a casual blue Veronica Beard shirt dress for a visit to an environmental project at Nuku'alofa's Tupou College. At a banquet hosted by Tonga's King Tupou VI and Queen Nanasipau'u on Thursday night, Harry said the island nation was ""a magical setting"". ""Coming to Tonga I feel very much as though I am coming to visit an extended family,"" he said, reading a message from his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II. ""It gives me great pleasure that my grandson and his wife are visiting the kingdom of Tonga,"" the Queen's message said. ""Our two families have enjoyed a deep and warm friendship over many years and I hope that our close relationship continues with the next generation."" After less than 24 hours in Tonga, they return to Australia later Friday for the final days of the Invictus Games, the Olympic style sporting event for wounded soldiers that Harry helped found. They will then end their marathon 16-day tour in New Zealand. (AFP)",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2018/10/26/20181026000573_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Kiha & The Faces to disband after 5th album release,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1811618,2018.10.18 13:10,"Six-member band Kiha & The Faces announced in the dark of the night on Wednesday they would disband year-end after releasing the group’s final and the fifth regular album in November. Having worked together for 10 years, the members of Kiha & The Faces -- Jang Ki-ha, Lee Min-ki, Jeong Jung-yeop, Lee Jong-min, Yohei Hasegawa and Jeon Il-jun -- will go their separate ways after their final album as a group. “The soon-to-released fifth album will be the final work of Kiha & The Faces,” each member updated their social media account as the clock ticked midnight after nightfall on Wednesday. “We will meet our fans through various routes after the album release, via concerts and more, through year-end. And as of the first day of 2019, us six will walk our separate paths,” read the message. The group promised the coming album will be the best yet of the works produced by Kiha & The Faces, and said, “In other words, this means that Kiha & The Faces has done all that it could.” The reason they decided to put an end to their career together was because they wanted to end things beautifully when they were at their best. The decision had been unanimous. Kiha & The Faces’ beginning was with the hit single “Cheap Coffee” in 2008. The group had ceaselessly made efforts to renew themselves through the 10 years they made songs. “We know this would hurt many of you who care for us, but we can say with certainty that this decision (to disband) is yet another call of ours to advance on to something new,” continued the message. “We believe we have your understanding and support.” Members of Kiha & The Faces will continue to work in music as singer-songwriters, performers, producers and DJs, and other ways. They urged their fans look forward to their next steps. The announcement ended on a more cheerful note, that the fans will enjoy unprecedented happy times with the band until the year-end and become witnesses to the best way to finish a band project. The fifth and the final album of Kiha & The Faces will release in November.

[Newsmaker] K-pop fans take action against online scalpers,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1801282,2018.10.05 16:55,"With so many events slated for this month featuring artists with huge fan bases, the race is on to get tickets to see our favorite singers live. Most concerts featuring world-famous singers can’t accommodate all the fans who want to be there, and ticket-reservation websites often crash as soon as tickets to a popular concert become available. The impact of too many people logging in at the same time is just too much for the servers. Knowing that competition will be fierce, fans gear up in advance as the day approaches, sometimes even resorting to improper means. They may use several friends’ IDs in hopes of purchasing one ticket, or they may use sketchy online ticket-trading sites. The more famous a singer is, the more of a nightmare it can be to get a ticket for a concert that should be a treasured memory. More and more, online scalpers are snatching up all the best seats by using macro programs -- computer programs that click continuously, buying more tickets faster than any human can. The scalpers then resell them to fans at extortionate prices. Until recently, there was no effective way to stop online scalping because there was no clear law against the practice. But as the problem got more and more widespread, singers and fans who fell victim to this dishonest form of ticket trading decided to take action. Veteran solo singer IU and her agency, Kakao M, drew praise for the definitive policy announced Sept. 27 on the agency’s official homepage. According to the announcement, if any ticket-trading irregularity is detected, the agency will buy the ticket to see the registration information, cancel the ticket and take legal action. If the ticket broker is found to be a member of IU’s official fan club, the person will be permanently eliminated from the club and can never attend another IU event. Not only singers but fans too are doing their best to hunt down online scalpers. Some fans are volunteering as “illegal ticket hunters,” searching for online posts advertising concert tickets at inflated prices and reporting them to the agency. Some agencies are compensating people who make such reports to encourage more fans to participate in stopping the ticket scalpers. As ticket release dates approach, tips can be found online showing how to report unauthorized ticket trading. Currently, unauthorized ticket trading constitutes a misdemeanor under the Minor Offenses Act, but only if it takes place on the scene -- that is, offline. Online ticket brokers cannot be prosecuted under the law as it is currently written. By Kim Hye-soo ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2018/10/05/20181005000897_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

Only 4.1 percent said they sought professional or medical help for their depression and other emotional needs. 　Korea saw its lowest-ever birthrate last year at 1.05 births per mother, falling under the previous record low set in 2005. The government has been emphasizing that Korea needs a birthrate of 2.1 births per mother, to keep its population level stable. 　According to the government, there are a number of reasons behind the low birthrate. One has to do with more women putting off marriage and motherhood, for both personal and professional reasons. As of last year, the average age at which Korean women had their first baby was 31.6, which was the oldest in the world. 　The study showed that the average age of all women who sought fertility treatment in 2015 was 35.6. 　As one of its demographic policies to tackle the low birthrate, the Korean government has been providing state allowances since 2006 for Koreans who seek fertility treatments. In 2010, the Ministry of Health and Welfare started giving allowances to those who wish to receive IUI and external fertilization procedures. 　The budget for the program increased dramatically from 31.5 billion won in 2007 to 92.5 billion won in 2016. 　Still, the treatments do not guarantee a baby. Only 13.9 percent of those who received IUI, and 29.6 percent of those who received external fertilization procedures in 2016 were able to become pregnant through the treatments. 　To provide support for women experiencing depression caused by infertility, the Ministry of Health and Welfare is launching a new, state-run medical facility in Seoul this week. The center, which will be located within the National Medical Center, will offer counselling for women undergoing fertility treatments, as well as mothers who are experiencing post-partum depression, the ministry said. 　 　By Claire Lee ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2018/06/19/20180619000911_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
AOA returns stronger after Choa’s departure,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1685496,2018.05.29 10:09,"After hitting a rough patch with former member Choa’s departure last year, AOA returned even stronger with its summery fifth EP. The EP “Bingle Bangle” is led by a lead track of the same title, a punky retro-pop song that boasts catchy refrains like “Bingle Bangle” and “Shake your hip.” Upbeat and vibrant in its synth and melody, the song is addictive due to its head-bopping whistle sound that augments the hook. Now a six-piece act, the band’s return marks its first official activity since Choa left the group in June last year. “Many are still used to Choa’s voice, but other members, including Yuna, had also played big roles as vocalists. So six of us have put a lot of effort to fill the stage. We’ve spent a lot of time talking to one another and monitoring our past videos in the process of preparing the album,” said Chanmi during a press showcase for the new album in Seoul on Monday. “Seven years have passed since our debut, and during that period, we became aware of each member’s strengths,” Yuna said. The band also addressed its lengthy hiatus, which lasted more than one year and five months, the reason why its comeback required more practice and a stronger mindset. “We’ve practiced until the wee hours for the comeback, just like in the past as trainees. We also gave up on wearing heels and chose sneakers instead, as the choreography for our new single is the toughest we’ve ever encountered,” Haejeong said. The event also saw Seolhyun opening up about a recent controversy over her personal Twitter account. She had stopped following some celebrities who had been embroiled in controversies related to gender issues, including Yoo Ah-in, IU and Yoo Byung-jae. Many netizens interpreted her action as a show of support for feminism, which invoked criticism from male-dominated online communities. “The unfollowing was merely part of re-arranging my follower list, as I had so many followers and I only wanted to communicate with my close acquaintances. But as soon as I heard of the controversy, I stopped unfollowing. I haven’t changed my (follower) list since the controversy,” Seolhyun said. She also added that she has become interested in gender issues in the process of broadening her perspective on various social issues. AOA originally debuted as an eight-member girl group in August 2012. Equipped with vocal prowess and powerful choreography, the act rose to stardom with infectious hits like “Miniskirt,” “Short Hair” and “Like a Cat.” In June last year, Choa, who had been embroiled in controversy over a prolonged break from activities, officially confirmed her departure amid rumors she was dating a game company CEO. Her agency FNC Entertainment, however, denied the dating rumors. Now in its seventh year, the band said its next goal is to have the new single top local streaming sites. “I think many people relate us with summer as we’ve released many songs in the summer season. I want our new single to be a representative summer song of this year,” Yuna said. The six-track EP, released Monday evening, also includes sultry retro-pop “Super Duper,” reggae-inspired “Heat” and disco-tinged “Ddu Ddu Ddu.” ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2018/05/29/20180529000423_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
New form of scarlet letter in Korean entertainment scene,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1679056,2018.05.22 16:00,"Actor Yoo Ah-in cautions against ‘men vs. women’ debate on feminism A star of critically acclaimed film “Burning,” Yoo Ah-in recently talked about being branded “anti-feminist” by the public. He is among a growing line of Korean celebrities who -- upon being labeled “feminist,” or “anti-feminist” -- get thrown into the line of fire by the public. In a recent interview with BBC News Korea, the actor expressed concerns over feminism-related discussions in Korea degenerating into a battle of the sexes. “This movement (in Korea) has taken the form of us versus them, spreading out in the form of a violent movement. ... There is the structure of ‘men, the discriminator of women’ versus ‘women, the victim.’ We must co-exist in this world, and I believe that the way to do so must be discussed in a less aggressive, more peaceful way,” said Yoo. The actor has defined himself as a feminist and called it “the most important human rights movement of today.” But he has been labeled as a misogynist by some feminists after he refused to apologize for joking about an online commenter being hit by a zucchini. (To read more about the incident, click: Yoo Ah-in moves to end ‘gender bashing’ dispute with netizens) Feminism most-widely refers to a range of movements that strive to achieve equal rights between the sexes. But the terminology has taken on a different connotation in Korea, due to what can be seen as gender-bashing by some portion of the movement. The phenomenon can be traced back to the misogynistic culture at some male-dominated online communities such as Ilbe. This, in turn, led to the creation of men-hating websites that “mirrored” the actions of their misogynistic counterparts. Being linked to “feminism” in any way has had severe repercussions for celebrities here. “My Mister,” a tvN drama, was recently accused of misogyny for a scene in which the female protagonist Lee Ji-an is beaten up by a loan shark. Her sarcastic comment “You like me, huh?” invited accusations that the scene attempted to romanticize dating violence, although there was no indication that the two characters were ever romantically involved and the character of the loan shark and the said scene were depicted in a negative way. IU -- who played Lee Ji-an -- was attacked on “radical feminist” websites for “selling the fantasy of dating older men,” referring to her on-screen relationship with her older boss. The singer-actor on Monday announced that she would take legal action over malicious online comments. Comedian Yoo Byung-jae was embroiled in controversy after pointing out that the drama never intended to justify violence. His comment, “Whenever I want to learn about feminism, they (women) push me away because I’m a Han-nam-chung (Korean male bug), and the other side pushes me away because I’m a hardcore-feminist,” made during a stand-up comedy show, also drew criticism. Being labeled “feminist” has an equally negative impact on a celebrity’s reputation. K-pop star Seolhyeon of AOA recently was thrust into the maelstrom for un-following Yoo Ah-in, Yoo Byung-jae and IU on Twitter while following Luna of f(x), who advocates feminism. Despite the K-pop star remaining mum on the meaning of her Twitter activity, it was interpreted as supporting feminism and invited criticism from male-dominated online communities. A local media outlet on Monday even published the article “Seolhyeon, a traitor to male fans?” In March, Irene of Red Velvet came under fire for saying that she read the feminist novel “Kim Ji Young, Born 1982,” as fans posted online burned and torn up photos of the K-pop star.

Comforting life through meeting ‘My Mister’,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1643217,2018.04.12 17:11,"IU admits Lolita complex controversy follows her Drama series “My Mister” didn’t get off to a smooth start, being hounded by controversies from the very beginning. At a media briefing held Wednesday, the producer and cast attempted to dispel concerns about the program, appealing to the public to see its sincerity. The tvN drama that airs at 9:30 p.m. on Wednesdays and Thursdays aims to portray how scarred souls heal each other, focusing on a relationship between a man in his mid-40s and a woman in her early 20s. The drama was criticized for setting up a couple with a 20-year age gap. With singer-actress Lee Ji-eun, better known by her stage name IU, taking the role of the 21-year-old woman, the controversy only deepened. Lee had already been mired in controversy for using the Lolita complex as a concept, particularly in her self-produced album “Chat-shire” in 2015. Despite her attempts, Lee has never been fully able to shake off criticism of impropriety. Lee admitted that she was concerned when offered the role, as it seemed likely to revive the old controversy. She said she hesitated in accepting it. “After reading the synopsis, I wanted to take the role. But I couldn’t readily say ‘yes,’ as I was worried that the drama might be swept up in unnecessary controversy because of me,” she said. “I even asked the producer if he knows about the controversy surrounding me, if he would be OK with it.” Producer Kim Won-suk managed to persuade her, stressing, “It’s not a love story, but a human story.” Speaking about his female lead, tears fell down the producer’s cheeks -- perhaps grateful to the actress, perhaps feeling sorry for her, too. “I have to thank her very much for playing the role well. The Lee Ji-ahn (Lee’s role in the drama) that actress Lee Ji-eun plays, is better than the one I prepare. She greatly contributes to the drama,” he said. To fend off possible criticism, the production team has paid extra attention to self-censoring some of the more provocative scenes. Though he is not fully content with the moves, the producer said it was necessary to achieving the drama’s original goal -- redefining the word “mister,” or “ajeossi” in Korean. “In recent years, the word seems to have come to have a negative meaning, making me wonder why. Through the drama, I hope to redefine the word and change its image,” Kim said. Kim also said the character played by Lee Sun-kyun, Lee Ji-eun’s “ajeossi,” is a reflection of himself. “The relationship between the two (main characters) is very odd,” he said, adding that such a relationship would typically be seen as inappropriate. “But we wanted to make viewers understand that the two become important for each other.” The producer who has directed hit series such as “Misaeng” and “Signal” said he is satisfied with the current series, having received more calls than ever from industry insiders complimenting him. He thinks “My Mister” has a unique, “previously unseen” female lead character. “Lee Ji-ahn is very dark. In many Korean dramas, female characters are often projections of the viewers. But Lee is too dark for that, hard to understand, too,” Kim said. Though the drama has a dark atmosphere, the producer considers it a comedy. “Comedy is what I would like to produce, but also it is the hardest to make. But essentially, ‘My Mister’ is a comedy, as it finds happiness in a tough life,” he said. Eight more episodes remain of the 16-episode series. It has so far garnered an average viewership rating of 4.5 percent. By Im Eun-byel ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2018/04/12/20180412000903_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
[Trending] #My Mister #IU,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1622454,2018.03.22 18:00,"A romance between a 45-year-old man and 21-year-old woman? It can’t be certain yet, but it seems drama series “My Mister” has drawn enough attention to kick off a good start. The first episode of tvN’s new series “My Mister” premiered Wednesday night to a high viewership rating of 3.9 percent, but viewers showed mixed reactions on the drama. The rating was the second highest of tvN’s Wednesday-Thursday lineup, following “Prison Playbook.” The series received massive attention from the public before its release, as the possible romance between the main characters with a large age gap stirred controversy. Fans of IU also welcomed the K-pop diva’s return to the small screen, as she hasn’t been seen in a TV drama since “Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo” in 2016. The term “My Mister” swept Naver’s real-time trending bar Thursday morning, while over 147,000 tweets with the title spread across the social media platform as well. Many viewers gave favorable reviews of the first episode, but many also expressed rage or discomfort toward both the concept and the series’ violent scenes. “There were no signs of romance in the first episode. Why do people react so sensitively over the issue (about romance between a middle-aged man and a young woman) that’s not even included in the drama?” one user posed in a review on Naver. “I really liked the actors and actresses, soundtrack and direction of the drama. Can’t wait until the next episode!” a dissenting voice on Naver said in a comment that garnered nearly 700 likes in four hours. “I thought I was watching a movie, not a TV drama. It’s amazing!” another comment says. “Was it necessary to include the scene that a male actor brutally hits a skinny and weak actress like that? Also, the actress says ‘You love me, right?’ after the beating. How horrible is it to glamorize violence with love?” a Twitter user said. The tweet was quickly shared 1,400 times with 1,253 comments, mostly agreeing with the opinion. “IU has bruises and scars on her face in the teaser video of the drama, as the concept of the drama is that a man clears her debt and beats her instead,” another Twitter user said. The tweet was retweeted over 25,900 times. “I looked up the scenario of the drama, as many people showed discomfort about it. But wait, what’s the drama trying to say? Why should we see middle-aged men with love? I don’t get it,” read a tweet that was retweeted nearly 8,000 times.

BTS wins Musician of the Year at 2018 Korean Music Awards,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1601750,2018.03.01 11:11,"K-pop group BTS on Wednesday won the Musician of the Year award at the 2018 Korean Music Awards, an independent music award show that focuses on both mainstream and genre music by South Korean artists. BTS was chosen winner of the award by the KMA's selection committee, composed of 56 judges who are music journalists, radio and television music program producers, columnists and critics. BTS was nominated earlier this month along with singer-songwriter IU, indie rock band Hyukoh and folk musician Kim Mok-in for the highly-coveted award category. The seven-piece boy band last year released its fifth EP album, ""Love Yourself: Her,"" which sold over 1.58 million copies to become the highest-selling album in South Korea in 16 years, after idol group g.o.d's fourth studio album in 2001. BTS has also enjoyed massive success overseas, with two tracks in the album -- DNA and Mic Drop -- both charting on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and being certified ""gold"" by the Recording Industry Association of America. Song of the Year was awarded to ""Tomboy"" by Hyukoh, after a five-way competition between Red Velvet's ""Red Flavor,"" ""DNA"" by BTS, ""Through the Night"" by IU and ""We Are"" by hip hop artist Woo Won-jae. Album of the Year award was handed to indie folk artist Kang Tae gu for his second studio album, ""bleu."" Rookie of the Year went to rock trio Sesoneon, while mainstream girl group Red Velvet took home Best Pop Music award for their 2017 summer hit ""Red Flavor."" IU was awarded Best Pop Album for her fourth full-length album ""Palette."" Hard rock-electronic music trio Idiotape took away the Best Electronic & Dance Album award with its third studio album ""Dystopian,"" as Cifika was awarded best song of the year for the category with ""My Ego."" Rico won Best R&B & Soul award with ""Paradise,"" as Hyukoh swept both Best Modern Rock Song and Best Modern Rock Album awards. Underground metal band Abyss took away Best Metal and Hardcore Album award with ""Recrowned."" Best Rap & Hip Hop Album award went to Viann and Khundi Panda for their joint album ""Reconstruction,"" while the best song for the category went to ""We Are"" by Woo Won-jae. KMA was formed in 2004 by a group of music critics, reporters, radio producers and cultural scholars as an alternative to big awards run by the country's three major TV networks -- KBS, MBC and SBS -- whose fairness had been called into question over many years. Most of today's music awards, such as those by streaming companies Melon, Soribada and music sales tracker Gaon, rely mostly on data, accounting for physical and digital sales, streaming and online popularity votes. KMA distinguishes itself by openly ditching the sales-based evaluation methodology and relying purely on recommendations from its selection committee. While KMA is often referred to as the ""Korean Grammys,"" it is more in the vein of Britain's Critics' Choice awards, given that members of the press and the critics community are part of the voting committee. Votes for the Grammy Awards are exclusive to members of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.

[PyeongChang 2018] Kim Yuna reigns supreme in Olympics commercials,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1594113,2018.02.22 14:32,"The former Olympic figure skater Kim Yuna is dominating Korea’s ad industry during the PyeongChang Winter Games. Kim is featured in Coca-Cola’s Olympics commercials alongside actor Park Bo-gum, as well as a host of other ads, reminding viewers of her solid standing as a top-notch model for big-time advertisers here. Widely dubbed “Queen Yuna” or “figure queen” in Korea, Kim reaped gold in the Vancouver Olympics in 2010 and a silver medal in 2014 Sochi. She is revered by many Koreans as a figure skating hero, even after retiring from her athletic career following the Sochi Olympics. Following her retirement, Kim has emerged as the darling of advertisers. According to All That Sports, Kim’s management agency, Kim is currently in advertising deals with 10 brands, including SK Telecom, KB Financial Group, It’s Skin and J. Estina. Kim is reportedly paid some 1 billion won ($930,000) or more per ad deal. Her income for 2017 is estimated at around 15 billion won. She is likely to see her income climb further this year, thanks to her prominent appearances at the Olympic opening ceremony, according to ad industry sources. Kim made a surprise appearance on figure skates during the opening ceremony, showing a brief, elegant performance on a small rink near the cauldron in front of millions of viewers worldwide. She then received the Olympic torch from two members of the Korean women’s joint hockey team, being the final bearer of the torch. “With her positive public image strengthened by her appearance at the lighting of the Olympic cauldron, it seems that she might receive more contract offers from advertisers,” said an official from one of Kim’s clientele. Kim has been ranked first on the brand reputation, according to the latest survey by a Korean brand research agency. Kim outsmarted other popular female singers IU and Hong Jin-young, who were ranked No. 2 and 3. According to the agency, consumers linked Kim with keywords such as “beautiful,” “doing well” and “like.” Thanks to the positive image, Kim remains a top sports celebrity. Kim also played a role in promoting PyeongChang so that the city could host the 2018 Winter Olympics.

Trot singer Hong Jin-young returns with retro ‘Good Bye’,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1584545,2018.02.08 14:56,"Singer Hong Jin-young, one of the most recognized trot singers in Korea, returned with new single “Good Bye” on Wednesday. “Each time I release a new single, I‘ve always thought that its popularity should outdo my previous hit ‘Love Battery.’ I just couldn’t help but put a lot of thought into each single,” Hong said during a media showcase for “Good Bye” in Seoul on Wednesday. Hong, who made her breakthrough debut with “Love Battery” in 2009, confessed that the popularity of her first hit always has been a burden. With “Love Battery,” one of her signature songs to date, Hong immediately drew press interest due to her decision to focus on trot, a genre that is considered old-fashioned and lackluster among young singers. And along with another trot bigname Jang Yun-jeong, Hong is often credited with having revived the genre among young generations. In her new single “Good Bye,” Hong veered away from her previous style and leaned toward a retro sound, while making sure it doesn’t sound too old. In the upbeat song, Hong blows a kiss to her past romance and says, “Good bye, forget me. I will fall in such trifling love a few more times anyway.” The song was penned by renowned composer Kim Ea-na, the mastermind behind hits like Brown Eyed Girls‘ “Abracadabra” and IU’s “Good Day.” In an effort to complete the vintage vibe of the song, Hong appeared at the showcase dressed in a lavender-colored velvet dress, wearing matching earrings and a hairband on her long black hair. Attention was also on composer Kim Ea-na, who made a special appearance as the host of the event. Asked why she decided to lend her hand in trot for the first time, Kim said, “I always wanted to work on trot, which is a genre widely loved regardless of gender or age. It first felt like an unknown territory with a high wall, but Hong became a bridge in overcoming that difficulty.” Kim also shared her thoughts on how Hong’s music has gained wide popularity despite not being in the mainstream. “I think there is a craving for that ‘trot-vibe’ everywhere in the world, just like recent Latin pop smash ‘Despacito’ which also has such feeling. While general pop music uses the trot-vibe as a spice, Hong’s music is an essence of that vibe, the reason why people love it,” she said. Originally having debuted as the short-lived K-pop girl group Swan in 2009, Hong rose to stardom with her smash hit “Love Battery” and has often referred to as the “queen of trot.” In 2016, she released her second EP “The Most Beautiful Moment in Life” and dropped a new single “Loves Me, Loves Me Not” last year. Aside from her singing career, Hong has also been carving out her own niche as an entertainer by appearing in several variety programs. Recently, Hong has also hinted at a new collaboration with singer Wheesung. “Just as I dreamed of becoming a trot singer, looking up to Jang Yun-jeong, I feel proud of myself for becoming an inspiration to other young trot singer wannabes,” she said. “I want to be active as a singer like a long-lasting battery. I hope people can enjoy my songs at a karaoke or get-together.” ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2018/02/08/20180208000798_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

"After a blockbuster year, K-pop looks to keep momentum into 2018",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1546108,2017.12.29 10:15,"From an unprecedented mega-hit debut to groundbreaking overseas successes, K-pop had one of its biggest years in 2017 in terms of diversity, substance and global outreach. And it will continue to be at the forefront of the resurgence of “hallyu,” or the global popularity of Korean pop culture, into 2018, according to industry watchers. From the start, the 2017 K-pop calendar was filled with back-to-back releases, with the first half and early summer highlights predominantly coming from female stars. Veteran act S.E.S released two anniversary singles and FNC’s flagship act AOA put out “Angel’s Knock” in early January. Seohyun and Taeyeon of Girls’ Generation released solo works in January and February, respectively, while TWICE stormed the music charts with “Knock Knock” and “Signal” in February and May. GFriend released two EPs and a repackaged record in the span of just six months, while smaller yet rising acts, such as Lovelyz and Gugudan, also deepened their discographies with new albums in the first quarter. Women also stood out in the singer-songwriter category, with artistic underdogs Suran and Heize both hitting big with “Wine” and “/// (You, Clouds, Rain),” respectively. IU also released her fourth full-length album, “Palette,” in April to critical and commercial success, while ex-FIN.K.L leader Lee Hyo-ri returned to the spotlight in July with “Black,” transforming herself from a sexy dance music icon into a genuine musician-artist. Ex-Wonder Girls chanteuse Sunmi successfully rebooted her music career with her captivating dance number “Gashina.” Big name boy bands lined up in the second half of the year to release their most ambitious projects to date. EXO of S.M. Entertainment released its fourth full-length album, “The War,” in mid-July and the much-hyped project group Wanna One, formed by survivors of idol audition show “Produce 101,” made one of the biggest K-pop debuts in history in August. K-pop titan BTS also dropped “Love Yourself: Her,” its biggest album so far, in mid September. The alternative music realm also saw a slew of critical darlings released. In June, G-Dragon put out “Kwon Ji Yong,” his fourth solo album, full of semi-autobiographical songs that reflect the BIGBANG member’s insecurities and growing pains. Hip hop trio Epik High also released its ninth studio album, “We’ve Done Something Wonderful,” drawing on themes of regret, fear and alienation, in October. The year also saw a number of rising artists grow and mature. With successive hits “Red Flavor” and “Peek-A-Boo,” Red Velvet cemented its position as a S.M. Entertainment’s marquee girl group, as Girls’ Generation, the label’s previous female stronghold act, entered its twilight phase after key members bolted. Taemin of SHINee also successfully morphed his career into that of a serious solo artist with “Move.” “Taemin has shown how an artist can establish his or her image through stage and performance and maintain it in a consistent fashion. His potential has exploded sufficiently in his latest album,” said Kim Youngdae, a South Korean music critic based in the U.S. city of Seattle. Looking back, 2017 was also a critical year for K-pop rejuvenating and further advancing its global outreach -- with BTS achieving a major breakthrough in the United States and TWICE landing a record-smashing Japanese debut. BTS’ American breakthrough was stoked in earnest in May, when the band won the Top Social Artist award at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in May. The septet broke new ground with their “Love Yourself: Her” album, which debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 chart in September, while “DNA” and “Mic Drop,” the latter as a remix single by DJ Steve Aoki, both entered the crucial top 40 of Billboard’s main Hot 100 chart. Having remained under the radar to the U.S. public and media, BTS’ American fan community this year went full throttle in throwing its weight behind the K-pop sensation, organizing a national radio song request campaign to boost the group’s U.S. profile from niche to mainstream. The group made major television outings, including a live TV performance at the American Music Awards in November and appearing on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” and “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” TWICE made its first overseas gamble this year by debuting in Japan, a neighboring country that has a complicated and troubling history with South Korea. The payoff was huge, with album “#TWICE” being certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan, an honor bestowed on records with sales of over 250,000 copies. The group, which is represented by JYP Entertainment and includes Japanese and Taiwanese members, followed up its success with a fall Japanese single, titled “One More Time.” The ladies didn’t slouch at home either, as they dropped their first full-length studio album, “Twicetagram,” in late October and their winter album, “Merry & Happy,” earlier this month. The K-pop scene this year also had its share of controversies and tragedies, with undoubtedly the biggest being the tragic death of SHINee lead singer Kim Jong-hyun, who apparently ended his own life on Dec. 18 due to depression. The incident sent shock waves throughout the broader K-pop community around the world. In July, BIGBANG rapper T.O.P was convicted for smoking marijuana multiple times at his apartment in October of last year, while SHINee singer Onew was investigated by police after being accused of sexually harassing a woman at a night club in August. Critics and industry observers expect the K-pop industry to expand further in scale overseas. “BTS this year has shown a level of growth that was unforeseeable. I think K-pop in general will continue its ascent next year, as well. BTS will leave an even bigger footprint in 2018 in my opinion,” Im Jin-mo, a Seoul-based music critic, said. Kim Youngdae predicted that K-pop will see its overseas fans base diversify further in 2018. “As witnessed in KCON in America this year, K-pop in the U.S. is slowly expanding its fan base into the African American and Latin American communities. I think Korean music in general will continue to add new layers of fans in addition to previous ones fond of Asian culture,” noted Kim. The industry is also cautiously optimistic of a market rebound in China, where sales of Korean cultural products, including TV shows and music concerts, were impeded for more than a year over Seoul’s decision to host a U.S. anti missile system, commonly referred to as THAAD. South Korea and China have announced that they will cooperate to normalize their ties in many areas that had been strained for months over the THAAD deployment. Idol audition shows are forecast to be bigger than ever but some are wary that the genre’s novelty factor has started wearing off. TV showrunners will try to keep things fresh by throwing in more variety TV show elements to engage the audience. The gender of contestants will also be a key factor in the success of shows. “One of the reasons Wanna One struck big is that its members were males, as opposed last year’s ‘Produce 101’ team I.O.I being formed by female singers. In reality, the majority of idol music fans consist of females. With that in mind, I don’t think anyone can guarantee whether (‘Produce 101’) will continue its explosive run next year,” said Im.

"[Lee Jae-min] Oops, Korea labeled as tax haven",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1543479,2017.12.26 17:46,"It was in 2013 that the EU designated Korea as an illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing country along with 11 other states, indicating a possible EU-wide sanction on Korean ships and fisheries products. The alerted government mobilized a yearlong campaign to persuade Brussels to delist Korea, and it was eventually taken off the list. Korea had its own problems of IUU fishing at that time, but so did many other countries. So, it was odd to see Korea on the list, the only industrialized state in the group. It is one thing to warn Korea to do better, but another to include the country in the worst group of the global fishing universe. Now the EU has surprised Korea with another “list.” Brussels designated Korea on Dec. 5 as a tax haven -- a non-cooperative jurisdiction, to be precise -- together with 17 other states such as Barbados, Grenada and Panama. This latest categorization means Korea is allowing itself to be used by global businessmen and corporations as a tax avoidance conduit -- bad enough behavior to be condemned by other countries. Interestingly, this time again, Seoul is an odd member of the group. Korea is the only country of meaningful economic size on the list: in fact, it is the only one that is a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development states, and has concluded tax treaties with EU member states. It is all the more embarrassing that the EU itself has concluded a free trade agreement with a country it now regards as a bad actor in the global finance system. It all started with South Korea’s administration of tax exemption and reduction law for foreign investors in the free economic zones. As the EU explains, preferential tax treatment in the zone is a magnet for possible tax evaders, so much so that the country should be included in the category of global tax havens. I have no desire to defend the government -- much less its tax law -- but this is a perplexing rationale, because this type of exemption is adopted by and available in many other states including some of the EU member states as well. If a tax exemption measure is branded as a tax avoidance facilitator, it should be so regardless of whether both foreigners and nationals receive it or only foreigners do -- the same incentive for foreign corporations. So, hard to fathom the logic. The government, though belatedly, is now putting full-court press on Brussels to reverse the decision. Well, Korea may be taken off the list one way or another. But the damage has been done. As the tax system and larger economic policies are implicated here, the damage is far worse than the IUU wrangling several years ago. From a wider perspective, it is a repetition of the IUU fishing listing and delisting. In both incidents, the government is to blame for clumsy handling of important matters. More active engagement with decision makers in Brussels should have taken place in advance. That said, speculation is that Korea has been inserted as an easy target to send a signal that new regulations do not necessarily target certain easily identifiable, developing states. South Korea is the “right size” of economy for such purposes, so goes the speculation. I believe the speculation is wrong. But proving it to be so would require some more plausible explanations from the listing authorities. The EU’s general objective here is legitimate by any standard. Illegal tax avoidance in the global community is now calculated as $32 trillion per year. Combating it is one of the top priorities of any responsible government. Korea should be warned if it does not abide by its international obligations. Absolutely. Failure to live up to a global standard should render any listing all the more deserving. Elements of mistrust or opaqueness in the tax laws and regulations should be addressed quickly. Certainly. If, on the other hand, Korea has been made an example of to dilute an image that only vulnerable, small states are captured on the list, it is a different story.

IU named singer of the year in survey,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1540230,2017.12.21 15:22,"IU has been chosen as the top singer of the year in an annual poll. Gallup Korea canvassed 4,200 people aged 13 to 59 across the country from July 6-26, Sept. 1-29 and Nov. 8-28, and the singer took the top spot, racking up 15.2 percent of total votes. Having debuted in 2008, IU released many chart-sweeping songs, including “Good Day,” “You & I” and “The Red Shoes.” In 2014, the singer was named best singer of the year in the survey as her cover album “A Flower Bookmark” gained popularity among all age groups. Girl group Twice, which had a prolific year with its hits “Knock Knock,” “Signal,” “Likey” and “Heart Shaker,” came in at second with 9.1 percent. Trot singer Jang Yun-jeong came in third with 8.9 percent while global K-pop sensation BTS came in at No. 4 with 8.5 percent. Following BTS on the list were Yoon Jong-shin, Wanna One, EXO, Big Bang, Im Chang-jung and Lee Sun-hee.

"SHINee members, fans bid goodbye to Jonghyun",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1536607,2017.12.21 10:16,"SHINee members, K-pop stars and fans gathered at Jonghyun’s funeral at Seoul Asan Hospital on Thursday morning to bid the late singer farewell. Hundreds of fans from across the country watched as the casket of Jonghyun -- whose real name is Kim Jong-hyun -- was carried out. Onew, Key, Taemin and members of Super Junior were pallbearers, while Minho and Jonghyun’s sister walked ahead of the procession holding his photo. The private funeral started at around 8 a.m. It was attended by Jonghyun’s family as well as officials and artists of S.M. Entertainment, including Girls’ Generation, EXO, NCT, BoA, Red Velvet, f(x) and S.M. founder Lee Soo-man. Other famous figures at the funeral included BTS, Zico, IU, VIXX, Wanna One and Jonghyun’s former girlfriend and actress Shin Se-kyung. Fans burst into tears as the hearse carrying the artist’s body rolled out of the funeral venue. One fan broke down, crumpling to her knees. Jonghyun’s burial site was not revealed to the public, at the wish of the bereaved family. Following Jonghyun’s death, a female fan in Indonesia was reported to have attempted suicide Monday. She wrote on her Twitter account that Jonghyun’s death, coupled with her also losing her parents, was too much for her to bear. She regained consciousness Tuesday. Jonghyun was found unconscious at a rented studio apartment in Seoul on Monday. He was pronounced dead shortly after being taken to a hospital. Investigators ruled the death a suicide. The note he left behind showed he had suffered from severe depression. Shortly before his death, he sent text messages to his sister saying, “It’s been so hard,” and, “This is my last farewell.” Born on April 8, 1990, Jonghyun debuted in 2008 as the main vocalist for SHINee. The singer had a barrage of hits with the boy band along with a successful solo career that kicked off in 2015. He was beloved by fans from across the world for his powerful voice, dancing prowess and often underappreciated songwriting skills. He wrote several fan favorites including “Breath” by Lee Hi, which sings of a person saying that she wishes to console her loved one even if she may not fully comprehend his or her pain.

‘Hyori’s Bed & Breakfast’ in search of new guest helper,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1530137,2017.12.13 16:55,"Director Jeong Hyo-min of JTBC reality show “Hyori’s Bed & Breakfast” announced Tuesday the show is on the lookout for the next guest and helper at Lee’s home on Jeju Island for the second season. The production staff said they have “a few people in mind to fill IU’s shoes.” Singer IU, who had been the guest and helper at Lee’s Jeju home throughout the first season of the show, received a lot of love from fans for her dedication as Lee‘s helper. The singer will not be joining the second season of the show, slated to start shooting in January, due to a conflict with another shooting schedule. Jeong expressed her wishes to conceal the identity of the new guest and hopes to capture the couple of Lee Hyo-ri and Lee Sang-soon’s happiness on camera upon seeing the new helper arrive at the couple‘s home. The second season of “Hyori’s Bed & Breakfast” has been taking reservations for a homestay via the show‘s official homepage, with the number of applicants exceeding 160,000 as of Wednesday. Applications for the upcoming season are more than five times greater that of the first season, with some 30,000 people having applied last year. Jeong further thanked viewers for the huge support and love for the show. “Hyori’s Bed & Breakfast” will start meeting with applicants for interviews on Thursday. Applications for the homestay with the Lees will be open-ended throughout the show. Similar to the first season, “Hyori’s Bed & Breakfast” is to take on the same concept of “healing” on Jeju Island with the couple. The contrast will be that the guests and helper will be different, with the setting as wintery Jeju Island. The show is set to air during the first half of next year.

Average Korean consumes 9 liters of alcohol a year,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1506380,2017.11.16 15:02,"Koreans of legal age consumed an average 9 liters of pure alcohol per person in 2015. The figure was confirmed by professors from the Catholic University of Korea Uijeongbu St. Mary’s Hospital and Inje University Graduate School of Public Health, through a study on data, Chosun.com reported Tuesday. Nine liters of alcohol would be 121 bottles of soju or 366 cans of 500-milliliter beer. Soju typically has 21 percent alcohol by volume while beer is about 5 percent. The research team analyzed the alarming figure as stemming from the aggressive marketing by convenience stores and big supermarket chains, the spreading “honsul” and “homesul” cultures and the increase in women drinking. Honsul refers to the act of drinking alone, while homesul refers to drinking at home. Convenience stores and supermarket chains have been selling four cans of imported beer at a discounted price of 10,000 won ($9). Sweetened fruit-flavored soju has also lowered the threshold for casual drinkers. Alcohol consumption per person from fruit-flavored soju catapulted from 0.04 liters in 2010 to 0.3 liters in 2015. Alcohol from foreign beer consumption also rose threefold from 0.05 liters in 2010 to 0.15 liter in 2015. Wine consumption similarly climbed per person from 0.07 liter to 0.13 liter over the same period. Critics say regulations on advertising alcoholic beverages in Korea should be reexamined. Currently, young and popular celebrities are being employed to promote major liquor brands. Lee Hyo-ri, Kim Tae-hee, Shin Min-ah, IU and Suzy have all represented homegrown liquors.

"Sex, edgy content sells in 1-person online media",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1465494,2017.10.06 15:15,"Unregulated content in internet broadcasting grabs viewers, but some stray into criminal territory “The one with the smallest buttocks has to drink, on a viewer vote.” Three men and three women dance and show off their behinds in front of the camera as part of an internet broadcast. The drinking game is followed by the gang hosting variety of risque games and conversations with none of the profanity or sexual content being edited out. The show by BJ -- broadcasting jockey -- Chulgoo is part of a growing fad for “makjang” entertainment, a Korean slang term for anything deemed to have gone “too far.” The term has an added significance when used in the context of scarcely-regulated internet broadcasting. These shows are popular for their raucous entertainment value, but often test the limits of their platform operators’ -- and the public’s -- tolerance with their tendency to go beyond South Korea’s broadcasting norms. On TV and radio, content such as sexual games, drinking and the use of expletives is subject to regulation by the Korean Communications Standards Commission, which can review content in advance. But this is not possible with live internet platforms. Authorities can make suggestions to remove certain content, but the ultimate decision on what to put on their websites and how to restrict access to minors is mostly left to the operators of the platforms themselves. Chulgoo, who has 727 million accumulated views on Korean live broadcasting platform Afreeca TV and over half a million subscribers on YouTube, is no stranger to online controversy -- he received fierce criticism this year for describing the May 18 Democratic Uprising as a riot. But other users have gone far beyond this into violent, misogynistic threats. Shin Tae-il is famous for his pranks on unsuspecting pedestrians, especially elementary school children. In one recent video, he drove into a gas station and asked for 10 won ($0.10) worth of gas. Although the videos seem obnoxious and pointless, there is a clear objective -- getting as many donations and views as possible. Afreeca TV channels make money from viewer donations, but broadcast jockeys such as Chulgoo make more money by re-uploading their content to YouTube. According to the Multi Channel Network Association, the estimated revenue per YouTube view is 1.2 won. But his videos have sometimes gone beyond mostly harmless attention-seeking and simple pranks, into situations that require police intervention. In August, an anonymous female YouTuber God Gun-bae touched a nerve among male viewers with derogatory comments about men. Shin revealed a picture of a woman who he claimed was the female broadcaster -- illegal in itself without her permission or good cause -- and said he would kill her, as well as issuing threats of sexual violence. Fellow YouTuber Kim Yun-tae followed up with a video, showing a picture of what he claimed was her house and said he would murder her. The video claimed to show Kim seeking her out, though it is unclear if it really was her house that he was targeting. The police intervened in his hunt, and Kim was fined 50,000 won. The incident served as a reminder of how serious web-related crimes can become. More commonly, K-pop stars have become subject to sexual comments on YouTube channels, including IU who vowed legal action against a YouTuber for sexual harassment Unchecked The videos containing the murder threat and the harassment of IU have both been removed from YouTube -- although copies of both keep reappearing -- but often the offensive content propagates unchecked. The Chulgoo videos mentioned above are age rated on Afreeca TV, but can be seen by anyone on YouTube still seven months after they were uploaded. YouTube provides guidelines for its community, warning against nudity, sexual content, graphic or violent content, harmful and dangerous content, hateful content, threats, spam, misleading metadata and scams. Violators can have their videos removed and even have their accounts deleted. But while nudity is quite strictly regulated, it is rare for YouTube videos to be removed for mere language. While some cases, such as Shin’s, have been removed from the website, the majority of Chulgoo’s channel remains intact, fused with curse words, drinking games and sexual jokes. Even if an account is blocked, a YouTuber can simply create new accounts. While God Gun-bae’s account was removed in August after she was revealed to have uttered inappropriate comments, she quickly made accounts of similar name to continue broadcasting. Despite the growing influence of one-person online media, internet broadcasting is not categorized or regulated as TV, radio or other forms of broadcasting. It is regulated by the operators of the platform; meaning Google -- not the government -- is mainly in charge of banning, rating or allowing content on YouTube. The law does stipulate that Korea Communications Standards Commission can review and regulate content that has already been produced, but this has only been practised in a handful of cases, partly due to staff limitations. According to Rep. Kim Sung-tae of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, only 126 cases have been penalized by the authorities from January of 2015 to June of 2016. During the same period, Afreeca TV gave penalties in 934,014 cases. And for content on foreign-based services like YouTube, the KCSC does not have the power to forcibly carry out its verdict. In last year’s parliamentary audit, the government revealed plans to request the National Assembly to revise the law so that internet broadcasting platforms that knowingly allow sexual or violent content and be fined up to 20 million won. But the plan was never put into action. Rep. Bak Maeng-woo of the Liberty Korea Party in August proposed to revise the law to mandate the registration of internet broadcasters and require them to remove or block content that is decreed by the law. The revision, however, would face obstacles; in addition to mire of legislative process, there is an ongoing debate about whether it is right for the government to regulate an individual YouTuber’s content.

[Album review] IU’s classics cover album lacks raw emotion,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1462090,2017.09.28 16:50,"IU “A Flower Bookmark #2” Loen Entertainment Attempting to recreate the magic of classics, this 24-year-old songstress seems to be bent on proving that she isn‘t just an idolized K-pop singer. With her latest offering “A Flower Bookmark #2,” IU aims to present herself as a thoughtful musician whose heart belongs to the bygone decades. Maybe it’s her signature breathy and light vocals, but the cover album doesn’t quite bear the weight and complicated emotions of the originals. IU flaunts her crystal clear voice in “Autumn Morning,” a 1991 folk tune by veteran singer Yang Hee-eun and guitarist Lee Byung-woo. But the song’s poetic lyrics are overshadowed by the singer’s overly sweet and soft voice. “Secret Garden,” a cover of Lee Sang-eun’s beloved song from 2003, suffers from the same problem. Lee‘s warm and mature voice delivers a message of encouragement, but the song’s power is diminished when delivered in IU‘s ear-tickling voice. “Last Night Story,” a remake of the 1988 hit by trio Sobangcha, is perhaps the most notable track from the EP. Instead of being a sugary fairy, IU experiments with rather deadpan and pouty vocals in the upbeat retro song, morphing into a late-night party girl who bemoans the previous night. One is glad to hear a song that fits the singer, finally making IU sound and look more her age. Other covers such as “Sleepless Rainy Night,” originally by Park Kwang-hyun in 1990 and made famous by Kim Gun-mo in 1992, and “Everyday With You” by ’80s icons Deulgukhwa, don’t sound that different from covers by other artists. And IU’s vocals, although flawless, are still too shallow for “Rapids,” a mournful poetic ballad by Jeong Mi-jo from 1972. The six cover songs that revisit the ‘60s to the early 2000s are well made and diverse, but IU may have been too ambitious in her bid to pay homage to the old classics she admires.

There’s this feeling that I as a person am being supported.” Kim Ki-soo, who began creating beauty videos on YouTube in 2012 and now hosts a beauty web series on Mobidic, agreed. “You can express 100 percent of your charm on YouTube.” Kim Ki-yeol, who livestreams online game-playing, often for 10 hours at a time, said that the platform brings an “incredible amount of freedom.”　 One significant advantage of the medium is the instant and constant feedback, the creators said. “I’m not overflowing with ideas, so I ask my subscribers for new ideas a lot,” said Kang. 　 Kang’s beauty tutorials dubbed into a comedic mix of Japanese and Korean languages have become a hit online. “That idea came from a subscriber, too, and it got great responses.” “I think the reason many people start a YouTube (channel) in the first place is to communicate with their fans, so I think that’s the right thing to do,” said Kim Ki-soo. “I think the appeal of a YouTube channel is that it’s something you create together with your subscribers.” Kim Ki-soo added that he believes the global attention has shifted from K-pop to K-beauty. The creators also spoke of the palpable difference between traditional broadcast media and digital media. The types of content that “work” are entirely different, they said. “When I first (started YouTube), (fellow comedienne) Ahn Young-mi and I went to the Korean Folk Village, dressed up in costumes and wigs and stayed there shooting skits for a whole day as you do for TV variety shows,” said Kang. “That video really did not get many views. That’s when I realized, this is a completely different world.” 　 Viewers prefer the more personalized content found online, she said, asking questions such as “What do these new spicy noodles taste like? How do you dye your own hair?” Content filmed in her own room with a minimal setup -- makeup tutorials, food reviews, daily routines -- fared much better, she noted. “It’s not a world where the output matches the input. I once tried to start a travel accommodations review on my channel, with my own money. I gave up, because the returns were nothing.” 　 Kang says she now makes around 2 million won ($1,759) per month purely for the number of hits her videos receive. “Right now, it’s nothing compared to what I made in television,” she said. Meanwhile Kim Ki-soo, who will be launching a set of his own makeup brushes later this year, has grown much larger as a YouTube personality. The profits are “significant,” he said.　 “Another advantage is that you really interact with people from all over the world. Most of my subscribers are in Australia, the UK, Italy and Japan,” he said. “I’m being invited to events there. (YouTube) really lets you learn about trends everywhere, but you have to keep up.” By Rumy Doo (doo@heraldcorp.com) A list of YouTube channels run by celebrities: Akdong Musician Suhyun - ""Mochi Peach"" (Beauty) BTOB Peniel - ""POV"" (Daily life) Comedienne Lee Guk-joo (Dance covers) Rainbow Oh Seung-ah - ""O'style"" (Beauty, exercise, food) f(x) Amber - ""What The Pineapple!""

IU to drop second cover EP this month,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1435035,2017.09.01 17:26,"Singer IU will release her new album “A Flower Bookmark Two” in mid-September, her agency FAVE Entertainment said Friday. The album is the singer’s second cover EP following “A Flower Bookmark” released in May 2014. The 2014 album featured the singer’s cover versions of K-pop classics from 1980s to 90s, such as Kim Chang-wan’s “The Meaning of You,” Kim Wan-sun’s “Pierrot Smiles at Us” and Kim Kwang-seok’s “Flower.” It received favorable reactions both from critics and the general public, sweeping the local music charts with all of its eight tracks.

Slimy ‘liquid monsters’ captivate Korean adults,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1411493,2017.08.09 16:03,"Vivid colors, squishy texture offer therapeutic effects Poke it and the dents slowly disappear; stretch it, and the strings droop lazily; mold it all back together, and it returns to its original shapeless blob form, evoking a strange sort of satisfaction. Such is the quality of slime, a squishy, glue-based substance that has become a sweeping global fad of late. Online clips featuring the multicolored, dough-like form -- which comes in all sizes and can be transparent, opaque, glittery or gravelly -- have been appealing to a wide audience, free from language barriers.　 Jelly, goo, Flubber -- there are many terms for the glutinous object that people have been eager to play with, but in Korea, they’ve come to be called “liquid monsters.” YouTuber Chupop is the most popular liquid monster creator here, having amassed over 600,000 followers and millions of views with his wacky DIY videos. 　 The trend has caught on here since celebrities, including singer IU, began posting clips that showed their hands playing with shiny slime on social media. The K-pop musician’s Instagram feed is filled with videos of her fingers molding the semi-liquid dough, poking it relentlessly or shaping it into cute forms. “The original clip is 40 minutes long,” said one of her captions for a one-minute video featuring banana yellow slime. Return to childhood One key reason behind the jelly-like object’s popularity can be found in the psychological comfort that tactile activities bring, according to art therapist Kim Eun-ji.　 “The types of unforced, mindless activities we loved as children, those that involve engaging our sense of touch -- like finger-painting unrecognizable shapes and forms with no logic -- bring us a sense of catharsis,” Kim told The Korea Herald.　 “They also remind us of our childhood. It’s a return to an extremely simple, childlike form of joy.” 　 From a psychological perspective, molding shapeless materials, such as clay and slime, allow their handler to express and examine their subconscious, Kim said. 　 “As a user can change slime’s form so effortlessly and without thinking, the shape that results can be a reflection of our deepest thoughts. Letting that out can be therapeutic.” 　 Another reason behind the fad is the visual aspect of slime. Infused with coloring, glitter and confetti, it’s pleasing to look at, according to Im Sae-mi.　 “Most of our customers are women in their 20s and 30s,” said Im, who is the CEO of Slime Korea, a company that began manufacturing and selling handmade slime online last year.　 “Many say they came to know about slime through Instagram. They started out by looking at videos of pretty slime, then wanted to try touching it for themselves.” Im had experimented exhaustively with different mixtures, finally landing on a well-guarded secret recipe that produces nonhardening, nonmelting and fragrant slime. “We use no harmful ingredients,” Im said. Beads and marbles can be mixed in to enhance the appearance. They also allow the slime to emit a crunching sound when handled, adding an audio element to the object. Im says social media has played a huge role in the spread of slime’s popularity. Online exposure through YouTubers and influencers has led to a marked increase in sales, she said. “We gifted our slime to one YouTuber a while back, and it was featured in one of her videos.” The following week, sales jumped twelvefold.　 “It’s gotten to the point where we’re limiting the number of orders per person because we can’t keep up with the demand,” she said. “Later on, we’re thinking of branching out to other kidult items like fidget spinners.”　 Numerous slime recipes circulate online. Mixtures are typically created with a glue base and a solidifying activator such as borax, or sodium borate. For those with sensitive skin or allergies, safety can be an issue. In March, it was reported that an 11-year-old girl from Massachusetts, the US, suffered chemical burns while playing with homemade slime. Extended exposure to borax was the cause, reports said.　 Children with atopic skin could suffer from skin irritation due to borax, according to Woo Sung-il, a professor of pediatrics at Chungbuk National University. Alternative recipes using saline solution, laundry detergent, shampoo and liquid starch are also available. 　 An inspection of 18 different types of clay and slime available on the market found no harmful elements, said an official at the Korea Consumer Agency. “(But) that does not ensure the safety of every product out there,” the official added. 　 By Rumy Doo ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2017/08/09/20170809000750_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Fans soak up ‘Wet Psy’ at ‘Summer Swag’ concert,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1412895,2017.08.06 16:35,"When it comes to highly-entertaining K-pop performer Psy, there are some things you just can’t do: You just do not sit down at a Psy concert or leave seat in the middle of the show. Friday’s “2017 Summer Swag” concert (“Soaking Wet Show” in Korean) was over three hours of pure madness and fun that had the 25,000 fans soaked to the skin and jumping with excitement. The show was part one of a two-day extravaganza at Jamsil Olympic Stadium in Seoul, in which the crowd was sprayed with water during highlights of the concert to beat the sweltering summer heat and humidity. “Everyone back stage was telling me. Unbelievable crowd tonight, they’re totally crazy. Thank you so much,” Psy told the delighted, screaming fans during the concert. He was not exaggerating. The “Gangnam Style” star blew them away, deploying 150 tons of water, 1,600 LED tiles and 1,500 fireworks to keep the crowd buzzing. Sprinklers that were all over stadium were intense enough to make reporters in the press seats, who were told that they would be safe from a soaking, move backwards to save their laptops. Psy kicked off the night with his 2017 release “I Luv It,” and fans immediately got on their feet, bouncing along to at the electro-house hit. He followed with a rock remix version of his old classics “Champion” and “Entertainer.” “My dear if you want it, anywhere in the world is a stage,” sang Psy as sprinklers showered the fans with water. He then gave the audience a chance to calm down with ballad “In My Eye,” or so it seemed. “I’ve noticed that the people in the second floor sat down as soon as the ballad song started. What was that about?” the pop star said jokingly, as the eager fans on the seating areas once again complied with his tacit command by immediately jumping to their feet. Catering to his old fans, there was also time to go retro as he performed “Bird” -- a title track of his 2001 debut album that earned him his reputation as a “bizarre singer” -- with his trademark bird dance. After singing “Gentleman,” he announced that he would do something he normally doesn’t do: Sing a song for couples at his concert. Instead of galloping on stage, Psy calmly sit down on a chair and began to sing “What Would It Have Been Like” -- a bittersweet ballad about a couple reminiscing on their time together -- when suddenly IU appeared on the stage to complete the duet. She added sweetness on top of the heated show by singing melancholy ballad “Through the Night” and upbeat dance pop “Good Day.” After claiming the stage for himself once again, Psy presented hits like “Right Now,” teary “Father” and “It’s Art,” giving the audience no time to dry themselves and soaking them in water. Zion.T, another guest of the show, briefly broke the parade of high-energy tunes by soothing the audience with his sweet vocals in “Eat” and “Yanghwa BRDG.” But it was during “Dream” when something truly special happened after the singer rolled out “New Face,” “Daddy” and “We Are the One.” The sprinklers sprayed water -- this time not at the audience but on stage -- in a circular form on which image of late veteran rocker Shin Hae-chul appeared. Shin’s face and his words “Maybe life is just a long dream” acted as a tribute for the Korean’s legendary musician, who was Psy’s longtime friend. The intro for Psy’s last song of the concert got the audience pumped up even before the famous line “Oppan Gangnam Style” was leashed out. Although the 2012 smash hit’s music video is no longer the most-watched video on YouTube, the song was never too old for fans, as they head-banged and horse-danced to the tunes with the “Gangnam Style” star. Night had wrapped up, but nobody seemed eager to leave. Psy, of course, teased crowds there was more to come and urged the screaming fans to crank up to volume. Amid their deafening screams, “DJ Psy” appeared on the stage to play and perform a medley of fan favorite dance songs of the ’90s. “Someday, we will meet again,” Psy sang in a 1993 Korean pop classic “Someday,” but the fans were not ready to say goodbye yet. “Out of all the concerts I’ve done, this is the lowest rate of fans going home!” Psy said with relish as he prepared for the final run. After a medley of old-school Korean rock and 1980 classic “As Time Goes By,” Psy saluted the crowd one last time with a full version of “Champion” that ended the night on a high note. Psy first introduced “Swag Show,” which later became one of his must-see-shows, in 2011 and performed it again in 2012, but hadn’t revived it until this year. Psy opened the 2017 “Swag Show” tour with a Busan concert on July 29, and will continue with concerts on Aug. 11 in Daejeon, Aug. 19 in Daegu and Aug. 26 in Gwangju.

Kakao Games debuts mobile RPG ‘Onmyoji’ in Korea,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1406169,2017.08.01 16:58,"“Onmyoji,” the hit 3-D mobile role-playing game that swept the Chinese and Japanese markets last year, has officially arrived in South Korea via Kakao’s game publishing unit Kakao Games. Kakao Games on Tuesday launched “Onmyoji for Kakao,” the localized version of the hit Chinese mobile RPG, via the Google Play store and Apple App Store in Korea. Developed by Chinese game developer NetEase, “Onmyoji” is a turn-based mobile RPG that has racked up more than 2 million downloads worldwide. It is the most highly anticipated mobile title to be released by Kakao’s game publishing unit this year. In “Onmyoji,” a Japanese term for a sorcerer in the Heian period of Japan, players fight evil spirits and monsters by collecting and maneuvering various “shikigami,” or spirits that aid the sorcerer. For the Korean launch of “Onmyoji,” Kakao said it took great care to localize the game for Korean players, employing more than 40 Korean voice actors as well as designating popular Korean singer IU as its marketing model. “When we think of ghosts or spirits, we typically think of expelling them. However, ‘Onmyoji’ is a game that requires players to strategically maneuver spirits to their advantage, offering a new, interesting twist,” said Kakao Games CEO Namkoong Whon during a press conference in Seoul in June. “‘Onmyoji’ is a game that will satisfy not only those who are already fans of RPGs but also new players interested in checking out the mobile RPG genre. We hope to offer players top-notch services so that ‘Onmyoji’ can become a game enjoyed by many,” he added. Currently, NCSoft’s “Lineage M” and Netmarble Games’ “Lineage II: Revolution” are the two most profitable mobile games in Korea. Nexon’s “Dark Avenger 3” released last week is trailing in third place in terms of revenue, and is now is expected to compete head-to-head with Kakao’s “Onmyoji.” By Sohn Ji-young ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2017/08/01/20170801000793_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

Death threat against Twice’s Mina latest in crimes targeting K-pop stars,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1359526,2017.06.14 14:18,"The internet was abuzz Tuesday at news that a death threat was made online against Twice’s Mina Miyoui. The unidentified person had posted a photo of a wrist and a knife, saying he or she would violently murder Mina if she did not mutilate her supposed boyfriend. It was later revealed to have been a practical joke of extremely poor taste. But JYP Entertainment said there will be ”no mercy” for the perpetrator and vowed legal action in what is the latest in a long line of crimes against Korea’s idol singers. K-pop‘s biggest stars have been threatened before. In April, IU said she planned to pursue legal actions against a local YouTuber for sexual harassment. The YouTuber in question made sexual comments about the female singer, comparing her to his dog in the videos. IU’s agency Fave Entertainment pledged “strong response without mercy.” The offenders most often offer the excuse that they were merely joking. The offender in the IU case said he was a fan and the comments had been taken out of context. His words and supposed apology, however, were muddled by a more recent video of him licking IU’s photo attached to a liquor bottle. The person who threatened Mina also posted an apology and said the disturbing post was made “just to become popular” online, and that he or she had not regarded the fear it would cause the victim. In a 2006 ruling, the Supreme Court clarified that the perpetrator’s actual intent or carrying out of the threat was not necessary to constitute a threat. This means that it is possible for the aforementioned internet user to be convicted regardless of whether or not he or she had actually intended to harm Mina. Making threats is punishable by up to three years in prison or 5 million won ($4,440) in fines, according to Korean law. Sometimes a death threat goes beyond simple internet trolling. In March, an unidentified person claimed he or she would shoot Jimin of boy band BTS to death during the band’s concert in California, along with a detailed layout of the seats and a picture of a gun. Although nothing happened at the venue, the incident had BTS and fans alike on edge. Later in the month, a man was caught secretly videotaping Yerin of K-pop group GFriend during a fan meeting. Unlike in the past when singers and their agencies attempted to address such issues quietly -- due to concerns about their public image -- more celebrities are now taking firm stances against ill-intended and often illegal actions against them.

'Onmyoji' game for Kakao set for August release,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1356393,2017.06.13 15:38,"“Onmyoji,” the hit 3-D mobile role-playing game that swept the Chinese and Japanese markets last year, is officially arriving in South Korea this summer through Kakao which hopes to cement the lead in game publishing. Korean mobile messaging giant Kakao on Tuesday announced that its mobile game publishing unit Kakao Games would begin servicing “Onmyoji for Kakao,” the localized version of the hit Chinese 3-D mobile role-playing game, in Korea from early August. Developed by China’s game developing company NetEase, “Onmyoji” is a turn-based mobile RPG that has racked up more than 2 million downloads worldwide, scoring positive reviews particularly from Chinese and Japanese players. It is the most highly anticipated mobile title to be released by Kakao’s game publishing unit this year. In “Onmyoji,” a Japanese term for sorcerer in the Heian period of Japan, players fight against various kinds of evil spirits and monsters by collecting and maneuvering various “shikigami,” or spirits that aid a sorcerer. The game is based on the ancient folklore of ancient Japan. “One of the most important factors we consider when sourcing in games is novelty,” said Kakao Games CEO Namkoong Whon during a press conference in Seoul to showcase the upcoming Chinese game. “When we think of ghosts or spirits, we typically think of expelling them. However, ‘Onmyoji’ is a game that requires players to strategically maneuver spirits to their advantage, offering a new, interesting twist,” Nam said. For the Korean launch of “Onmyoji,” Kakao said it took great care to best localize the game for Korean players, employing more than 40 Korean voice actors as well as designating the popular Korean singer IU as its marketing model. The game publisher has even collaborated with the famous Korean webtoon artist Hun behind the webtoon and film “Secretly, Greatly,” to produce a special promotional webtoon for “Onmyoji.” For the past few years, Kakao Games has been making continued efforts to rise up as a leader in the game publishing business by leveraging some 40 million users of Korea’s most widely-used mobile messenger KakaoTalk. It is aiming for an initial public offering next year, and is currently working to expand its business portfolio and market influence to maximize its corporate value as much as possible before going public. In the past year alone, the Kakao-owned game publishing firm spent some 70 billion won ($62.04 million), or 22 percent of the firm’s revenue in 2016, toward acquiring or making strategic investments in Korean game companies, it said. They include small-sized mobile game development startups such as Fincon and ShiftUp as well as virtual reality game developers like EVR Studio, according to Kakao. Kakao Games is seeking to strengthen its role in the global game publishing industry by launching games on diverse platforms including smartphones, PCs and virtual reality systems. “I think new industry leaders emerge when new platforms are introduced. We’re eying potential genres that will rise to the spotlight as the game industry transitions from mobile to augmented and virtual reality platforms,” Nam said, citing “sports” as a promising genre.

[Herald Review] G-Dragon reveals ‘true self’ at Seoul concert,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1354442,2017.06.11 11:19,"From the singer’s outfits to the concert lighting and his microphone, everything on stage was splashed a bloody red, a color that represented the theme of G-Dragon’s Saturday solo performance: going back to the roots of his birth. “Hello, my name is Kwon Ji-yong. You are witnessing the first-ever concert by ‘the human Kwon Ji-yong’,” the frontman of Big Bang screamed at 40,000 fans after opening his set at the “2017 Concert: Act III, M.O.T.T.E” on Saturday at Sangam World Cup Stadium in Seoul with his first solo hit “Heartbreaker” and then moving onto “Breathe” and “A Boy.” G-Dragon’s approach to his third concert as a solo artist was simple. After spending a majority of his life in the limelight, the Korean superstar wanted to reflect on his true self and show audience a more private side of 30-year-old Kwon Ji-yong, G-Dragon’s non-stage persona. “Standing in front of you as ‘G-Dragon’ for so long made me wonder what my real self would look like. I’ve suffered from so much physical and mental distress preparing for the latest album, but it gave me a chance to look back at myself,” the artist said. G-Dragon’s new EP, released Thursday, bears his real name as the title as if to explore his persona without his celebrity status. Although G-Dragon did not directly address the marijuana controversy surrounding his fellow member T.O.P, he made a joke that the concert was within an inch from not happening. A sea of fans welcomed the artist’s honest confession by screaming and waving crown-shaped glow sticks in the group’s signature color yellow. Before ramping up the audience, G-Dragon didn’t forget to warn fans about the red-soaked stage that portrayed a “mother’s womb,” the early stages of life before being covered in fame, glory and riches. Full of swag and energy, G-Dragon galloped on to show his old hits such as “But I Love You,” “One of a Kind,” “R.O.D,” “The Leaders” and “Black.” During a performance of “Obsession,” a female fan jumped onto the stage and grabbed G-Dragon, but the artist smoothed out the interruption by continuing with his performance until she was escorted out. There were plenty of other pleasant surprises to the already heated stage. The audience’s cheers grew louder when singer IU took to the stage to perform her hit “Palette” with G-Dragon, who had featured in the song’s rapping. After the performance that marked their first on-stage duet for the song, the audience was able watch them having small talk. G-Dragon shared that he had received a fridge full of bottles of soju wrapped with banners of his face, as a gift from IU after he worked on “Palette.” “It was enough to drink until I enlist in the army. I still feel dizzy,” G-Dragon said. IU wittily replied that he would have to drink them up before he enters the army next year. The two wrapped up the collaboration by singing G-Dragon’s “Missing You” together. In line with the theme, the concert also featured heartfelt interviews with G-Dragon’s acquaintances about what kind of person he was. A screened video showed band mates Daesung and Taeyang, label mates Psy and CL, his celebrity friends and staff members sharing their thoughts on G-Dragon. The video also showed a rare scene of the artist’s father supporting his son with a message that Kwon was the best son in the world. After performing tracks from his new EP including “Superstar,” “Intro. Middle Fingers-up” and “Bullshit” in a row, G-Dragon chugged some water, panted for breath, picked up the microphone and finally said, “Now I’m running out of energy.” But he kept on sharing his earnest thoughts about what this concert truly meant. “Being a singer has always been a dream from my childhood, but now that I have run toward this goal for so long, I feel like I’m living in a dream. It feels so good, but I sometimes lose track of what is real and what is a dream. So I’m trying to get back to how I was in the beginning,” he said. He also joked by asking fans if they would still welcome 32-year-old G-Dragon when he returns from his military duty that will begin next year. The crowd gave its answer by cheering even before he finished his words. With thunderous requests for an encore, he wrapped up the concert with his classic hits “This Love,” “Crooked” and the new album’s lead track “Untitled 2014,” in which he crooned about a past romance. Saturday’s Seoul concert marked the beginning of his tour across 19 cities around the world, including Macau, Singapore, Bangkok, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, New York, Sydney, Osaka and Tokyo.

The popular singer’s album also swept local charts as well, topping the Gaon chart in album sales, downloads and streaming services.

IU says she's confident of new album 'Palette',https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1305671,2017.04.21 18:19,"K-pop singer-songwriter IU on Friday expressed confidence in her new album ""Palette"" and thanked fans for pushing her pre-released song to No. 1 on music charts despite zero promotional activities. I had no idea that the pre-released song would be loved this much. I'm so happy that 'Through The Night' reached No. 1 on the music charts even without publicity,"" IU told reporters at a media event held at the Shinhan Card FAN Square in northern Seoul. IU released her fourth full-length album ""Palette"" at 6 p.m. It holds 10 tracks, including two songs -- ""Through The Night"" and ""Can't Love You Anymore"" -- released late March and early April. ""Through The Night"" topped most major streaming charts upon release. The 25-year-old singer explained that she didn't want to restrict herself to a particular style or genre, hence naming the album ""Palette,"" a term for a wooden board used for mixing colors for painting. ""A palette holds a variety of colors. During art class in elementary school, I was always more fond of the palette as opposed to the painting I was making."" She added, ""This album was first started from the idea that as much as a palette is a tool, it could also be the artwork itself."" IU also said she was confident that the latest album has the best written songs so far in her career. ""I really like the songs and am also confident of it. I believe may people will like it. I like it a lot."" Title track ""Palette"" is a retro synth-pop song that features rapping by BIGBANG's G-Dragon. The album also includes ""Ending Scene,"" a slow-tempo ballad heavy on strings written by singer-songwriter Sam Kim. Kim Soo-hyun, star of hit South Korean drama ""My Love From the Star,"" appears in the music video for ""Ending Scene"" together with IU. The two stars together appeared in the 2011 KBS 2TV drama ""Dream High"" and also on ""Producer"" on the same network in 2015, and are reportedly close friends.

미신·탐욕에 사라져가는 희귀동물…보르네오섬 천산갑 멸종위기,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1304176,2017.04.20 16:02,"총탄도 퉁겨내는 비늘이 관절염 등에 좋다는 미신 때문에 보르네오 섬의 희귀동물인 천산갑이 멸종으로 치달아 안타까움을 자아내고 있다. 20일 말레이메일 등 현지 언론에 따르면 보르네오 섬 북부 말레이시아령 사바주(州) 일대에서는 10여 년 전까지만 해도 천산갑을 흔히 볼 수 있었다. 사바주 끄닝가우 지방에 사는 자닌 루와야(36·여)는 ""어릴 적 집 뒷마당에 천산갑이 종종 들어왔다""고 말했다. 그는 ""지금 생각하면 좋은 행동이 아니었지만, 가까이 다가가면 몸을 둥글게 마는 습성이나 이리저리 쳐다보는 몸짓이 귀여웠기에 나와 동생들은 종종 천산갑에 장난을 치곤 했다""고 덧붙였다. 하지만 보르네오 섬에서는 천산갑이 더는 흔한 동물이 아니다. 현지 동물 연구가인 엘리사 판장은 ""한때 천산갑은 보르네오 섬 전역에서 쉽게 발견됐지만, 지금은 어쩌다 한 마리를 보는 것도 굉장히 운이 좋아야 한다""고 말했다. 당국에 적발된 것만 따져도 연간 1만 마리 이상이 불법으로 포획된 뒤 도살돼 해외로 팔려나가고 있기 때문이다. 천산갑의 비늘은 류머티스성 발열을 억제하는 부적을 만드는 데 쓰이며, 비늘을 빻은 가루는 한약재로 사용된다. 특히 중국 부유층 사이에선 정력에 좋고 관절염과 천식, 요통 치료 효과가 있다는 소문 때문에 천산갑의 고기가 고급 식재료로 쓰이는 것으로 전해졌다. 이러한 까닭에 밀렵 되는 천산갑 대부분은 중국에서 소비된다. 사바주는 1997년 천산갑을 보호종으로 지정하고 밀렵 적발 시 5년 이하의 징역과 5만 링깃(약 1천300만원) 이하의 벌금에 처하고 있다. 하지만 천산갑 밀매로 얻을 수 있는 금전적 이익이 적지 않아 단속에 어려움을 겪고 있다. 사바주 야생당국의 밀렵단속 책임자인 모흐드 소피안 아부 바카르는 ""천산갑을 찾기 쉬운 정글이나 팜오일 농장에 있는 이른바 '수집상'들은 천산갑 밀매로 상당한 이윤을 남기고 있다""고 말했다. 이들은 밀매 조직에 천산갑 고기를 넘기고 1㎏당 120링깃(3만1천원)을 받는 것으로 알려졌다. 이는 팜오일 농장의 하루 일당보다 훨씬 많은 금액이다. 이와 별개로 천산갑의 비늘은 1㎏당 150∼180링깃을 받을 수 있다. 특별한 요리에 쓰이는 천산갑의 태아(胎兒)와 살아있는 새끼를 가져다주면 마리당 2천 링깃(52만원)을 챙길 수 있다. 소피안은 ""주민들이 사냥해 온 천산갑 2∼3마리만 넘겨도 1주일 이상 따로 일할 필요가 없는 셈""이라면서 ""수집상들이 모은 천산갑은 인적이 없는 해안에서 어선 등에 실려 해외로 반출된다""고 말했다. 야생동물 전문가들은 천산갑의 경우 정글 개간으로 인한 서식지 파괴보다 밀렵으로 인한 개체 수 급감이 더 큰 위협이 되고 있다고 입을 모았다. 엘리사 판장은 ""온순한 성격 탓에 밀렵에 무방비로 노출돼 있다는 점도 개체 수 감소세를 더욱 가파르게 하는 요인""이라면서 ""천산갑의 고기와 비늘에 대한 수요를 억제하는 것이 무엇보다 시급하다""고 말했다. 사바주는 멸종위기종에 대한 보전 의식이 희박한 정글 지역 주민들을 상대로 의식 개선 캠페인을 벌이고 있지만, 성과가 날 때쯤이면 천산갑은 이미 멸종된 뒤일 가능성이 크다. 실제로 국제자연보호연맹(IUCN)은 2014년 보고서에서 천산갑의 야생 개체 수가 21년 만에 기존의 20% 이하로 급감했다고 밝혔다. IUCN은 모두 8종의 천산갑을 모두 '취약종'과 '멸종 위기종', '심각한 위기종'으로 지정했다. 판장은 ""갈수록 기승을 부리는 야생동물 밀매를 고려할 때 야생 천산갑이 이미 멸종한 수마트라 코뿔소와 마찬가지로 10년 이내에 멸종한다고 해도 이상할 것이 없는 상황""이라고 말했다.

Basaglar challenges Sanofi’s insulin drug Lantus,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1298038,2017.04.14 15:44,"Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim launched Basaglar, a biosimilar referencing Sanofi’s blockbuster insulin drug Lantus, in South Korea on Thursday, intent on challenging the original drug’s dominance in the domestic market for diabetes treatments. Basaglar KwikPen, designed as a pen-shaped self-injection device, is a long-acting basal insulin for the treatment of adults and children with type 1 diabetes mellitus and adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The drug secured approval from Korea’s Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in November 2015, but its domestic launch was delayed reportedly due to price negotiations between the drug’s developers and the local government. Basaglar is already being sold in markets around the world, including in the US, Europe and Japan. It was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2014 and by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2015. Now debuting in Korea, Basaglar will compete with its reference drug Lantus (insulin glargline) as well as second-generation insulin drugs like Sanofi’s Toujeo (insulin glargline) and Novo Nordisk’s Tresiba (insulin degludec). As a cheaper, near-replica alternative to the original drug, Basaglar is priced at 10,714 won ($9.50) per pen (300 international units per milliliter) at the top of the insurance coverage ceiling. That is around 14 percent cheaper than Lantus, priced at 12,245 won. “When considering one pen, a price difference of just 1,500 won seems minor, but for diabetes patients who must receive the injections daily, this price difference can be significant in the long run,” said Cho Jae-yong, head of diabetes franchise at Eli Lilly Korea during a press conference held in Seoul on Thursday to mark Basaglar’s local launch. According to Cho, a patient weighing 70 kilograms and in need of 0.51 IU/ml of daily insulin would require 12,600 IU/ml of insulin injections per year — or around 42 insulin pens. Choosing Basaglar would cost 449,988 won, while Lantus would cost 514,290 won. With its pricing advantage to Lantus, Basaglar is also expected to compete with next-generation insulin drugs, which despite being more expensive, offer improved therapeutic effects compared to their first-generation counterparts. First-generation insulin drugs Lantus and Basaglar will reach their peak effect in about 12 hours after injection and then begin to wear off. On the other hand, second-generation insulin drugs Toujeo and Tresiba can last for 24 hours with no pronounced peak or wear-off, and also require lower injection dosages. In terms of pricing, Basaglar is currently around 20 percent cheaper than next-generation insulin drugs Toujeo, priced at 12,870 won, and around 97 percent cheaper than Tresiba, priced at 21,095 won, according to local reports. Looking ahead, two other biosimilars referencing Lantus are also approaching commercialization in Korea -- one developed by MSD with partial funding from Samsung Bioepis, and another developed by India-based Biocon and locally marketed by Green Cross. MSD’s Lusduna was approved by the EMA in January and is currently awaiting approval by the US FDA. The drug is also under review by the Korean Drug Ministry. Korea’s Green Cross acquired the local licensing rights to a Lantus biosimilar developed by India-based Biocon in November 2016, and has filed the drug for approval in Korea.

Korean content seeps through Chinese ban,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1239904,2017.02.15 17:27,"Following the joint Korea-US decision to deploy THAAD battery in Korea last July, a de facto hallyu ban has been in place in China. Following is the first article in a three-part series that examines the impact of the unofficial hallyu ban on the Korean entertainment industry. --Ed. While Beijing has reportedly been banning Korean content within China since last August, the unstoppable flow of the Korean Wave, or Hallyu, seems to be seeping into the country through online channels. On a greater scale, drama production companies and Korean celebrities have incurred considerable losses due to China’s restrictions. Approval to air the much-anticipated TV series “Saimdang, Memoir of Colors” in China is still pending, while the series has already begun airing in Korea. Actor Song Joong-ki’s voice was removed from a TV advertisement in China, while actress Yoo In-na left the cast of Chinese drama series “Love Through a Millennium 2.” But it seems the unofficial circulation of content has proven less easy to control. Though unable to air on Chinese television, pirated files of the hit series “Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,” which aired only on Korean television from Dec. 2, 2016 to Jan. 21, complete with Chinese subtitles, are circulating the internet, according to reports. Clips of “The Legend of the Blue Sea,” another popular TV drama that aired only in Korea after the reported ban, are also being shared, while illegal streaming sites bearing the shows have popped up. No numbers are available on the views or downloads via these underground channels, but other visible figures attest to the unrelenting spread of Korean content. Gong Yoo, who starred in “Guardian,” became the most searched personality on Chinese social media network Weibo on Jan. 22 and 23. The series also ranked among the most searched terms on Chinese search engine Baidu. Over 420 million posts bearing the hashtag for Gong Yoo have been uploaded on Weibo, while songs from the series’ original soundtrack have reached over 8.8 million downloads on China’s largest music platform QQ Music. Taiwan’s United Daily News reported last Wednesday that “Guardian” had been the most watched drama series during the Chinese New Year holidays. “There’s a need to probe various channels, and not simply rely on the existing mainstream channels,” said Kim Hyun-kyung, head of the China Contents Lab. Kim also pointed out that regulation of content -- both local and foreign -- is nothing new in China. Though the stars are not able to monetize their success in China while the ban is still in place, their popularity has led to a surge in tourism of areas featured in the hit drama series. Chinese tourists have been flooding to Duksung Women’s University and to Incheon’s Jumunjin Beach, where “Guardian” was filmed, reports say. Korean celebrities’ continued popularity also showed through in “Power Star,” a list ranking the popularity of foreign celebrities within China. In January’s list, Sehun and Baekhyun of EXO and actors Kim Soo-hyun, Lee Jong-suk and Song Joong-ki ranked as the top five most popular male stars. As for female celebrities, f(x)’s Krystal, Girls’ Generation’s Yoona, solo singer IU and actresses Song Hye-kyo and Song Ji-hyo took the top spots. The reported ban additionally seems to be loosening on films coproduced by Korean and Chinese companies. “Beautiful Accident,” jointly produced by Chinese Studio Huayi Brothers and South Korean company Showbox, has been confirmed to open in Chinese theaters on March 17. Though Korean actors are not included among the cast, which features Chinese stars Chen Kun and Wang Jingchun and Taiwanese actress Gwei Lun-mei, Korean boy band EXO performs the theme song.

Korean dramas enjoy huge wave of popularity in US,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1227046,2017.02.03 20:25,"South Korean dramas have become another driving force of the ""hallyu"" craze, or the Asia-wide boom of Korean culture, along with K-pop in the United States, a Seoul-based cultural agency said Friday. According to a recent report released by the Korea Creative Content Agency's (KOCCA) U.S. office, Korean TV series, particularly romantic comedies, are riding a huge wave of popularity among women in their teens to early 30s in America. The report is based on an online survey conducted by the KOCCA on 4,753 Korean drama fans in the U.S., which is double the number of respondents in the last survey conducted in 2014. The results were broken down by age, ethnicity and gender. Young internet users dominated the survey - 38.5 percent were ages 16 to 20, 21.9 percent were 20 to 25, 13.1 percent were 26 to 30 and 7.7 percent were in their early 30s, making up 73.5 percent of the total respondents. Asian viewers led the pack with 25.5 percent, trailed by 25.1 percent Hispanics, 24 percent white and 9 percent African-American. Compared to the previous survey, white fans have significantly increased, climbing to third place. Most Korean drama fans, 95.1 percent of them, used online streaming services to watch subtitled series. DramaFever turned out to be the most popular platform with 63.9 percent, followed by Viki with 19.1 percent and Netflix and YouTube each recording 2.8 percent. More than half of the respondents -- 59.8 percent -- said they have been watching Korean dramas for more than three years, while 13.7 percent said it had only been two to three years and 13.65 percent one to two years. The study reflects Korean dramas' ongoing popularity, racking up 87.1 percent of avid fans who have been watching for more than a year. When it came to genre, romantic comedies were by far the most preferred recording a whopping 72 percent. Melodrama lovers came in second with 11.7 percent, trailed by historical dramas recording 9.9 percent and crime or action with 9.2 percent. The most enjoyed dramas reflected the participants' taste. The top five dramas among U.S. viewers were romantic comedies, with ""Descendants of the Sun,"" at the top, followed by ""Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo,"" ""Cinderella and Four Knights"" and ""Oh My Venus."" Meanwhile, the most famous actors were, in order, Lee Min-ho, Lee Joon-gi, Lee Jong-suk, Song Joong-ki and Ji Chang-wook. Among actresses, Park Shin-hye received the most votes, with Kong Hyo-jin ranked second and IU, Song Hye-gyo and Hwang Jung-eum rounding out the top five. ""The greatest attraction of Korean dramas is in the creative, well-structured story plot,"" said Kim Cheol-min, head of KOCCA's U.S. office. ""The results prove that K-dramas are expanding internationally, encompassing all ethnic groups."" The agency plans to distribute the collected data to media, academia and other related associations in order to establish policies and marketing strategies. (Yonhap)",,iu
IU to hold solo concert next month,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1136376,2016.11.03 16:20,"Singer-songwriter IU is set to return to the stage next month.　 Known for her girl-next-door image, the musician will be holding a solo year-end concert at Olympic Park’s SK Olympic Handball Gymnasium in Bangi-dong, Seoul from Dec. 3-4. “The upcoming concert is an opportunity to look back on the past 24 years of IU’s life,” according to the artist’s agency Fave Entertainment on Thursday. “She will also be performing never-before-heard tracks.”　 Although she has held concerts abroad in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong in recent months, this will be her first solo performance in Korea since her nationwide tour last year. 　 Focusing on building her acting career, IU played the lead role in hit drama series “Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo,” which aired its final episode Tuesday. 　 IU, who made her debut with the single “Lost Child” in 2008, most recently released her seventh EP “Chat-Shire” last year. 　 Tickets will be available exclusively on ticket.melon.com starting on Nov. 10 at 8 p.m. By Kim Yu-young ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2016/11/03/20161103000270_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
K-pop idols suffering from stress-related illnesses,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1125167,2016.10.23 17:50,"This month alone the local entertainment industry has been hit with a number of K-pop idols suffering from fatigue and other stress-related mental health issues. With all these stars taking time out from their hectic schedules, one question needs to be answered -- where do we draw the line? In a span of three weeks, a member of mega hallyu boy band EXO fainted at Incheon airport, a Crayon Pop starlet suspended all her music activities due to anxiety, and a member of the newly debuted WINNER halted the group’s new album endeavors in order to tend to his “psychological issues.” On Oct. 11, EXO member Lay, along with the rest of his group members, were at the Incheon International Airport getting ready to board their flight to Japan when the K-pop idol suddenly collapsed. Those who saw the incident occur at the airport said that Lay remained unconscious as he was transferred to a hospital. After being rushed to the hospital, the K-pop star’s agency released an official statement saying, “Lay momentarily lost consciousness due to a lack of sleep. Thankfully, the doctor said he will make a full recovery after he gets some rest.” However, the incident led to a massive online outrage by dedicated EXO fans who bashed and lashed out against the entertainment agency for overworking the idols to the point of causing damage to the young entertainers’ health. Following the incident, Lay later went to urge fans not to blame S.M. Entertainment for the incident. “The fainting was my fault, please don’t curse out my fellow company colleagues,” he said in a press conference for his upcoming Chinese drama “The Mystic Nine,” eight days after the incident occurred. “The schedule arrangements were all mostly my choice. I’m the type of person who doesn’t like admitting defeat, so I always try to do everything I can. The agency respects my thoughts.” However, this is not the first time the K-pop star has lost consciousness. A similar incident occurred last May during filming for a Chinese variety show. It was concluded that Lay once again passed out due to exhaustion and fatigue. Earlier this month, both Crayon Pop member Soyul and WINNER member Nam Tae-hyun announced they were halting all of their public appearances and recording sessions. On Oct. 12, YG Entertainment announced that Nam will be suspending his role as a member of the popular new boy band WINNER indefinitely, claiming the young singer is currently seeking treatment for “mental health issues.” Although the agency did not specify exactly what sort of health issues Nam has been diagnosed with, they claimed that his issues were something that he had been dealing with since his days as a trainee, adding that his condition has “taken a turn for the worse.” It has been reported that the singer has moved out of his dorm room at the agency and is back living with his mother and is receiving treatment for his illness. In the case of Soyul, a representative of Crayon Pop’s managing agency stated that she would be suspending all group activities for the foreseeable future as the singer was recently diagnosed with having an anxiety disorder. “Her conditions are worse than expected,” the agency stated, noting that for the time being, Crayon Pop would be continuing as a four-member act. It is certainly no secret in Korea that the training process to debut as a K-pop star is no quick or simple venture. Often referred to as music “boot camp,” K-pop training among some of the nation’s biggest talent agencies is intense, to say the least. And with only a fraction of trainees able to become K-pop stars, the atmosphere among trainees can be fiercely competitive and cutthroat. With popular K-pop reality shows such as “WIN: Who Is Next?” and “Sixteen,” the public eye has been given a rare behind-the-scenes glance at the extreme late hours, stressful pressure and sheer competitive nature of the local music industry. Many ex-K-pop trainees go on to share their various experiences online through various blog postings such as “Confessions of an EX-SM Trainee” and “K-pop Secrets!,” further shedding more light on all the gritty, cut-throat reality of life as a K-pop trainee. “We had all begun to work extremely hard. Education turned out to be our last priority and making an impression on the reps, staff and CEO was (the) first priority,” wrote one former Korean-American ex-YG trainee. “This was a terrible time for me. Friends that I had made were slowly turning to rivals.” “We all began to battle each other and whatnot. I have to say that YG is definitely a serious agency, as in like the competition is dead on, there is no time for laughing and fooling around,” he continued. “Being in an agency that focused mainly on talent made things extremely difficult.” In the past, Girls’ Generation member YoonA went public about her ongoing battles with depression, as well as other famous stars including Park Bom of 2NE1 and Hee-chul of Super Junior, Epik High’s Tablo, who all claim to suffer from depression. Singer-songwriter IU has also gone public with her struggles with bulimia, while f(x)’s Amber, SHINee’s Jong-hyun and MBLAQ’s Lee Joon have all been diagnosed with insomnia.

Vacuum industry Olympics opens in Korea,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1057928,2016.08.22 15:47,"A gathering of professionals from academic and industrial research communities in the fields of materials, coatings and surfaces worldwide opened for an eight-day run in the coastal city of Busan on Monday.

Seoul makes bid to host 2021 World Forestry Congress,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1030271,2016.07.26 16:49,"The Korea Forest Service submitted a bid last week to host the 15th World Forestry Congress in Seoul, officials said. The WFC, also known as the “Olympics of Forestry District,” is the largest international conference where delegates discuss countermeasures for forest maintenance, management and economic problems by sharing knowledge and experience every six years. Being nominated as a host city would imply that the hosting country’s forestry service is globally recognized. The proposal was delivered to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and presented at the FAO Committee on Forestry, where 600 representatives from 120 countries gathered at the FAO headquarters in Rome, Italy, to go over global forest issues and discuss Sustainable Development Goals on the future forestry service from July 18 to 22. Seventeen Korean government delegates were sent there, including Korea Forest Service Minister Shin Won-sop. Minister Shin started the proposal with brief reasons why Seoul is the most suitable city for hosting the WFC in 2021. In a speech, he said that Korea has a successful history in reforestation after the Korean War and is “ready and able” to share its experience and technology to expand the vision for the future of forestry. Rah Seung-yun, a communications adviser for KFS and co-CEO of Oratio, continued the proposal with more detailed explanation on Seoul’s capability as a host city. She said that Korea has successfully launched many international conferences, such as the International Wildland Fire Conference and IUFRO World Congress. Thus, the country is capable of execute efficiently the organization of the WFC, based on its experience. “Current partnership between agencies like FAO and KFS will be bolstered and yield mutual benefits if the WFC is held in Korea,” Rah added during her speech. The KFS further highlighted what it means to hold the WFC in Asia-Pacific, “considering the desirability of regional rotation.” Since the first congress in 1926, the WFC has been held in Asia-Pacific only twice, and the last time was nearly 40 years ago in Indonesia. In reponse to a video shown when the proposal was delivered, many foreign delegates appeared impressed with Seoul’s innovative plan in transforming once barren land into lush, green forest, according to KFS officials. The officials said Korea has promoted various welfare programs that use restored forests, such as operating forests for healing and forest kindergartens, and fostering urban forests in major cities. “We are sharing those policies with countries including Canada, China and Indonesia through exchange and cooperation programs,” a KFS official said. In addition to the proposal, the KFS held a series of bilateral meetings with China, Paraguay and Chile to ask for support, and hosted “Night of Korea” to promote Seoul last Wednesday. The WFC host city will be announced in December at the FAO Council in Italy based on the proposals during the FAO Committee on Forestry.

Liquor brands bet on celebrity endorsements,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1011360,2016.07.05 10:30,"[THE INVESTOR] Liquor companies in Korea, that face restricted advertising regulations, are increasingly relying on celebrity endorsements for higher returns, according to industry officials on July 4. The government has been tightening regulations on liquor ads, revising the law on national health improvement. Recent changes include barring liquor ads on TV from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. to limit minors’ exposure to them. Advertising on radio, the Internet and public transportation are also restricted. Liquor companies are trying to work around these limits by hiring top celebrities as models to leave a strong image in the briefest time with consumers, industry officials said. Song Joong-ki, the lead actor who clinched fame from the drama “Descendants of the Sun,” was recruited by Hite Jinro. The company had already reaped ad effects from another celebrity model, singer IU. Seol Hyun, a member of girl group AOA, was snatched up by Lotte Chilsung Beverage, which is looking for a new model to replace actress Shin Min-ah whose contract expires at the end of this month for its main soju brand. Smaller, regionally based companies have also picked up the trend. Bohae Brewery has hired girl group Girl’s Day, while Muhak signed a contract with actress Park Bo-young. About the only exception is the No. 1 beer company Oriental Brewery, which is sticking to lesser known celebrities and average citizens as its ad models. “Advertisement restrictions on liquor firms are growing heavier, and companies are relying more on celebrities with star power to give them the best results,” an official said. “This marketing tactic will likely continue for some time.” ()",,iu

State insurance to cover more infertility treatments,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/999454,2016.06.26 17:35,"More infertility treatments, including medical examinations, will be covered by national health insurance in Korea starting next year, as part of the government’s measures to boost the nation’s low fertility rate, the Health Ministry announced on Sunday. According to the ministry, the number of Korean couples who sought medical help for infertility increased from 178,000 in 2006 to 215,000 in 2015. Every year, some 200,000 Koreans are newly diagnosed with the condition, which is defined as not being able to become pregnant after a full year of trying. Starting next year, medical costs for infertility tests, such as semen analysis, hormone testing and biopsies, will be covered by the national health insurance. More treatments, such as fertility drugs for women with ovulation disorders and sedative drugs used during an egg retrieval procedure needed for intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization will be covered as well, the ministry said. As part of its demographic policies to tackle low birthrate, the South Korean government has been providing state allowances for Koreans with infertility since 2006. In 2010, the Health Ministry started giving subsidies for those who wish to receive an IUI -- a fertility treatment that involves placing sperm inside a woman’s uterus to facilitate fertilization -- and external fertilization procedures. To qualify for the subsidy, each couple has to earn 150 percent of the national average monthly income -- about 5.27 million won ($4,500) -- or less. For the IUI, a couple can receive up to 500,000 won, which covers about half of the total cost, for up to three procedures. For eternal fertilization, a maximum of 3 million won is given to each couple, according to their household income, for up to four procedures. In general, a single IUI costs about 500,000 won, while a single extra fertilization procedure costs about 1.5 million won. From 2006-2015, a total of 100,993 newborns were born here to parents who received state support for their infertility treatments. The budget for the program also increased dramatically from 31.5 billion won in 2007 to 92.5 billion won this year. Still, a recent study has shown that many couples are struggling with infertility, especially those who have not been able to conceive even after three or four IUI or extra fertilization procedures. The study by Hwang Na-mi from the Korea Institute and Social Affairs found that 81.9 percent of the surveyed 1,063 Korean women who were being treated for infertility were extremely stressed because of the condition. Also, 59.6 percent of them said they felt socially isolated and depressed because of infertility. Another study by researcher Hwang, published in May, found that more than 75 percent of Koreans who received government subsidies for IUI in 2014 had unexplained infertility. The figure is strikingly high compared to the world average -- only about 30 percent of all men and women who get treated for infertility worldwide are diagnosed with unexplained infertility, according to the World Health Organization. The statistics may indicate that infertile Korean couples are not being properly tested -- by not being asked to undergo the required semen analysis or ovulation testing -- before receiving IUI or IVF, researcher Hwang explained. The Health Ministry is also to introduce a three-day vacation for workers who are being treated for infertility, starting next year, officials said. By Claire Lee ()",,iu

[FEATURE] Tackling body shaming in South Korea,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/988126,2016.06.14 16:57,"Alina Shamsutdinova thinks she can’t dress up to her potential in South Korea. The 23-year-old Kazakhstani arrived in Seoul in 2011, as an international student, in hopes to learn about the country of her ethnic origin. Born to third-generation ethnic Koreans in Kazakhstan, she grew up thinking she was beautiful, feeling confident and comfortable in her skin. 　Yet things started to change when she realized some people in Korea didn’t see her the way she saw herself. “Among the things I heard was ‘It’s okay to be ugly, but being fat is unforgivable,’” she said in an interview with The Korea Herald. 　“Another was ‘You’re really lucky that you have a pretty face. Otherwise you would never be able to have a boyfriend.’” 　While she has always considered herself a confident person, Shamsutdinova said a part of her struggled with her self-image during her stay in Korea. She was often told by Koreans that she should lose weight. Most local clothing stores didn’t have any items available in her size. 　When she lost some 10 kilograms by fasting in 2014 -- she only drank water and milk for a week -- she was told by hear Korean acquaintance that she should lose more. Throughout that week, she felt dizzy and weak. Since then, she’s made numerous attempts to lose weight after gaining it back again -- until she recently decided to solely lose weight to be healthier. 　“I think I just tried to follow what others told me, or what the society wants,” Shamsutdinova said on her previous tries to lose weight to look slimmer. “I was young and I thought that was right. I felt that this way I was working on myself when the work should’ve been done from the inside first.” 　Lookism and eating disorders 　While there aren’t a lot of studies available on body shaming in Korea, statistics show that a significant number of Korean women are struggling with their body image and eating disorders. 　In a 2013 study by Samyook University that surveyed 154 female university students in the normal weight range -- meaning their body mass index was from 18-23 -- almost 95 percent of them said they were unhappy with their bodies. Among them, 61.1 percent said they felt the need to lose weight in order to look more attractive. 　Among some 1,796 Koreans who sought medical treatment for bulimia from 2008-2013, almost 94 percent of them were women. Also, women in their 20s and 30s accounted for 66.5 percent of all patients. A number of K-pop stars and celebrities, including IU and Jang Na-ra, have openly admitted that they’ve experienced the eating disorder, which involves binge eating often followed by frantic efforts to avoid gaining weight. And many may be suffering in silence, as statistics released by the National Health Insurance Service do not include those who may have been bulimic, but did not seek professional help. 　Meanwhile, a study last year by Soon Chun Hyang University, which monitored South Korea’s public broadcasters for six months, found that body shaming of plus-size women was prevalent on Korean TV. 　For example, an episode of “Hello,” a talk show on KBS2, featured the story of a young woman who belittled her younger sister, whom she called “fat and short,” when the sibling said she was confident about her own body and thought that she could date anyone she wanted. 　The younger sister said on the show: “My sister said I looked ‘disgusting’ when I wore shorts.” 　The study also found that many TV producers didn’t see the connection between the nation’s prevalent lookism and gender disparity. The researchers asked six TV producers to rate the importance of combating lookism and body shaming on television on a scale of zero to five -- five being the most important. The producers on average rated it 1.5 out of five. 　“I think lookism applies to both men and women (on TV),” one of the surveyed producers told researchers for the study. “I don’t think lookism is part of the gender inequality issue.” 　Body shaming in the education system 　Won Yoo-ri was 17 when she returned to Seoul in 2010 to attend university here after living overseas for 16 years. During her first months back, a middle-aged woman on the street literally gasped when she saw her wearing shorts. 　“Oh my god, when are you going to lose weight? Women must be skinny in order to find men,” the woman, whom she had never seen before, told her. 　From that day on, Won said she was body shamed left and right in Korea, from strangers to friends, classmates and even professors. One of her older classmates once told her that he’d date her if she lost 30 pounds (14 kilograms). She had never been interested in dating him. Once at a restaurant, a server told her that she should stop eating because she had eaten enough. Won also had a professor who told her she would “have it all” if she lost 10 kilograms. 　She said all of these experiences severely affected her self-esteem. 　“In the U.S., I felt that my personality was all I needed and people responded to it,” she told The Korea Herald. “But to come to a country and constantly hear a conversation turn to ‘you should lose weight’ was heartbreaking. That became my identity -- the outgoing fat girl from LA.” 　Pressured by the constant shaming, Won has made a number of efforts to lose weight since 2010. She has sought help at a weight management company. In another try, she ran 10 kilometers a day for two months in the harsh winter weather. “I even considered getting my stomach stapled,” she said. 　The whole point of losing weight was to avoid the shaming and get complimented on her looks, she said. One of her college friends also starved herself for four months -- she’d only eat half an apple and a single chicken breast a day -- to lose weight. In the process, she passed out at least four times. “(I wanted to) finally feel beautiful for once in Korea and meet the standards,” she said. “So I can move on and better myself in other aspects.” 　Ashley Hounsell, a 29-year-old American English-language teacher, has been working at a high school in Seoul for the past six years. She’s witnessed many of her current and former female students who were insecure about their body image. Every year during their health checkup, the scale would display everyone’s height and weight for the whole class to see. “I remember girls telling me they weren’t eating for the week before their school checkup,” Hounsell told The Korea Herald. “When I asked why, they told me because everyone gets to see their weight.” 　Before working at the high school, she taught younger children at a private English-language institution. There, one of her female students, who was 9 at the time, wrote in her diary that she was on a cucumber-only diet because her mother told her she was fat. 　South Korea currently does not offer any educational programs specifically on body image or self-concept for school children. 　“Our gender-equality program for school teachers includes a session about how one should not be discriminated against because of their appearance,” said Lee Myung-eun from the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family’s Gender Impact Assessment Division. 　Fat shaming and fashion industry 　In Seoul, Shamsutdinova only shops in Myeong-dong, at foreign stores such as H&M and Forever 21, because Korea’s homegrown brands simply don’t offer anything available in her size. Once, while looking at a shirt for a friend at a Korean store, a sales assistant grabbed the shirt away from her hands, without even asking. “And then she started saying (in English) ‘(too) small,’ ‘(too) small,’” she said. “I was speechless.” 　Shamsutdinova said even online shops and foreign stores in Korea often don’t have many items for plus-size women. And she’s often unhappy about those that are available -- they are often too baggy or unflattering, and don’t complement plus-size body figures, she said. “Having only a couple of stores where I can buy my clothes isn’t easy,” she said. “It feels like if you are plus size you are not allowed to look good. I can’t be as fashionable as I want to be (in Korea) even though I want to look beautiful.” 　Baek Jae-hwan, who has been running an online retailer specifically targeting plus-size women for five years, said most Koreans tend to think those who dress well are only those who are thin. His shop, www.tongkeungirl.com, is one of very few Korean online stores that features plus-size models for their clothes. One of the models is in fact Baek’s wife, who is also his business partner. 　“My wife has always had a very specific taste in clothes,” Baek told The Korea Herald. “She’s always preferred simple and modern design over something too frilly or dressy. As she couldn’t find what she wanted to wear available in her size, she wanted to find them herself. That’s how we started our business.” 　Baek said he’s received a lot of positive feedback from his customers, who also expressed their frustration over other online stores that feature skinny models when they claim to cater to plus-size women. “One’s body and its size has little to do with his or her ability to dress well. I’ve seen skinny people who dress terribly,” he said. “Being a good dresser means you just understand your body, what works the best for you. I think it’s totally possible for people with all kinds of body shapes to dress well. But I also understand that plus-size individuals have limited options to choose from. And that needs to change.” 　Bringing changes 　Earlier this year, Shamsutdinova participated in a special project called “I am Beautiful,” which featured photographs of 24 individuals who have struggled with self-image and are making efforts to love and accept themselves as they are. 　For her, discovering the existence of plus-size models worldwide, especially Tess Holliday, one of the best known body-positive activists in the U.S., and South Korea’s first plus-size model Kim Ji-yang, made a difference. She has recently accepted that it is not easy for her to lose weight and she would only go on a diet for health purposes, not to meet the beauty standards here. 　While she thinks plus-size models shouldn’t justify obesity and an unhealthy lifestyle, Shamsutdinova said the world needs to see more people like Holliday and Kim to change their views on beauty and women’s bodies. 　“Once I started seeing girls my size in the media, I definitely started to appreciate my body more and accept myself more,” she said. “(Learning about) Kim Ji-yang was just empowering. She looked beautiful. She is Asian like me even though there is a stereotype that ‘Asians are usually slim.’” 　James Turnbull, who writes on Korean feminism and popular culture at his established blog the Grand Narrative, said asking Korean TV producers to notice lookism was like “asking fish to start paying attention to the water.” 　He pointed out that Korea has the highest rate of celebrity endorsements in the world, as roughly 60 percent of all commercials here feature celebrities, as opposed to about 10 percent in most other developed nations. 　“(The South Korean government) can set an example by choosing alternative role models as representatives for its own numerous public campaigns, rather than always going for a young, thin K-pop star,” Turnbull said, when asked what Korea could do to tackle the issue of body shaming. 　Like Shamsutdinova, Won also recently decided to lose weight for her own sake and health, and said she’s never been happier. “A year ago I met my current boyfriend who happens to be Filipino-American,” she said. “Being around him and his friends reassure me and encourage me solely to, perhaps, lose weight to be healthier was my turning point. It really depends on who you surround yourself with.” 　By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com) 　Ashley Hounsell is not her real name.

Actors vie for Song Joong-ki's Asian heartthrob throne,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/989655,2016.06.14 13:49,"Since the smash-hit drama series “Descendants of the Sun” ended its 16-part run, speculation has abounded as to who is to succeed Song Joong-ki -- who played dashing Army Capt. Yoo Si-jin -- as Asia’s next leading heartthrob. 　From medical dramas to period pieces, an ambitious roster of TV shows starring some of the country’s most in-demand male leads are scheduled to launch in the coming months. 　First up is the SBS show “Doctors,” featuring actor Kim Rae-won as a high school biology teacher haunted by his former medical internship, during which he accidentally caused the death of a patient. After meeting student Hye-jung, played by wildly popular actress Park Shin-hye, he is motivated to return to the hospital and become a neurosurgeon. The 35-year-old actor, who previously played a greed-driven prosecutor in the 2014 series “Punch,” will return as a warm character this time round.　 　The KBS2 series “Uncontrollably Fond,” scheduled for a July 6 start, will feature model-turned-actor Kim Woo-bin, 26, in a heart-tickling romance with K-pop starlet and actress Suzy. The show will mark Kim’s first time on the small screen since his role as a bad-boy millionaire in 2013’s “The Heirs,” and feature him as an equally tantalizing tease. 　On July 20, the MBC series “W” will kick off with actor Lee Jong-suk, 26, as the male lead. Lee, who formerly played a tortured genius reporter in the 2014 “Pinocchio,” will return once more as a character with uncommon intelligence -- a mystery-shrouded entrepreneur who previously won an Olympic gold medal, then switches careers to learn computer engineering and founds his own venture company, becoming massively wealthy. 　The later months will see three period pieces. “Moonlight Drawn by Clouds,” scheduled to air Aug. 15 on KBS2, will star “Reply 1988” actor Park Bo-gum, 22, as a young prince in a story of teenage heartache set in the Joseon era. Kim Yoo-jung will play his female love interest who enters the palace disguised as a eunuch. 　The SBS show “Scarlet Heart: Ryeo,” set for an Aug. 29 launch, will detail the story of Taejo Wang Geon, who founded the Goryeo Dynasty in 877. The role of the cold and measured king will be played by Lee Joon-gi, 34, who is known for performances in numerous period pieces including 2005 film “King and the Clown” and last year’s TV series “Scholar Who Walks the Night.” The female lead role will be taken up by singer-actress IU. 　 　Actor Song Seung-heon, 39, is lined up to star in “Saimdang, the Herstory” alongside “Jewel of the Palace” star Lee Young-ae as a famed artist and principled royal standing against the corruption of the Joseon era.

Unexplained infertility high among Koreans: study,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/950383,2016.05.04 16:32,"More than 75 percent of Koreans who received state allowance for insemination had unexplained infertility, a strikingly high figure that may indicate many of them are not being properly tested before receiving the procedure, a study showed Wednesday. The study, by researcher Hwang Na-mi from the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, showed that the proportion of Koreans who received government allowances for infertility treatments in 2014, especially intrauterine insemination and external fertilization, is unusually high compared to the world average. IUI is the deliberate introduction of sperm into a uterus or cervix for the purpose of getting pregnant. Quoting data from the World Health Organization and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the researcher claimed that only about 30 percent of all men and women who get treated for infertility worldwide get diagnosed with unexplained infertility. Meanwhile, 52.8 percent of Koreans who received state allowances for external fertilization, and 77.2 percent of those who received the funds for IUI, had unexplained infertility, the report said. The researcher referred to a 2005 government report which showed that only 21.4 percent of all Koreans with infertility did not know their causes, while 32 percent were caused by men, such as abnormal sperm. In an interview with The Korea Herald, Hwang argued that it is possible that a large number of patients who underwent the procedures may have been either misdiagnosed or not properly tested at all. According to the WHO, a couple is diagnosed with unexplained infertility when the cause of their condition remains unknown even after an infertility work-up, usually including semen analysis in the man and assessment of ovulation and fallopian tubes in the woman. Some of the most common treatment options for unexplained infertility include IUI and external fertilization. “But until 2015, there was no clear definition of what unexplained infertility in Korea’s government guidelines for infertility patients,” she said. “It was only in October of last year that the guidelines specifically stated that those with unexplained infertility are individuals who couldn’t achieve pregnancy for three consecutive years starting from the date that they received their test results - semen analysis and assessment of ovulation and fallopian tubes -- that were normal.” As one of its demographic policies to tackle low birthrate, the South Korean government has been providing state allowances since 2006 for Koreans who suffer from infertility. In 2010, the government started giving allowances to those who wish to receive IUI and external fertilization procedures. To be qualified, each couple has to earn 150 percent of the national average monthly income -- about 5.27 million won ($4,564) -- or less. For IUI, a couple can receive up to 500,000 won, which covers about half of the total cost, for up to three procedures. For external fertilization, up to 3 million won is given to couples, according to their household income, for up to four procedures. From 2006-2015, a total of 100,993 newborns were born here to parents who received state support for their infertility treatments. The budget for the program increased dramatically from 31.5 billion won in 2007 to 92.5 billion won this year. “Right now we have no data to find out whether the patients were informed of other treatment options other than IUI,” Hwang said. “We currently don’t have much data that could explain to us why the proportion of unexplained infertility patients is so high. All I can say is it is highly likely that they were not tested properly or misdiagnosed.

Worldly a cappella group bridges cultures through song,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/907068,2016.03.23 16:19,"It's almost dinner time. A middle-aged Korean man ushers a racially diverse group of young people into a dimly-lit restaurant in Seoul. ""Before college, they were troublemakers. Today, they are Treblemakers. Please welcome them with a round of applause!"" With that cheesy line delivered in somewhat broken English, the college a cappella group walks in, with the 17 members wearing a matching black T-shirt and a pair of blue jeans. The act's opener is a song that apparently starts out as Ariana Grande's ""Focus"" but swerves in and out of ""Gee"" by the South Korean girl group Girls' Generation. A male soloist leads out with the Korean verse, and the female quad backs him with the chorus, ""Gee Gee Gee Gee Baby Baby Baby."" Audience members, mostly 40- and 50-something Korean men in suits and ties, nod in approval, as if the line rings a bell. Afterward, the students go around and introduce themselves, their majors just as diverse as their backgrounds. One of them ticks off his three majors -- voice performance, mathematics and Chinese. Founded at Northwestern University in 2004, Treblemakers is on its first-ever tour, and being the only East Asian interest a cappella group on campus, they've chosen three Asian cities -- Beijing, Seoul and Hong Kong -- as their first destinations. ""We figured since we're an East Asian interest group, our first tour should be in Asia,"" Kate Lee, the team's music director and a senior studying voice performance, music education and sociology, said. ""Hopefully after this, we'll take national tours and maybe travel to other places, but we really wanted to share music with Asia."" And sharing is what they did in Seoul. At the restaurant on Monday, they performed in front of the local Northwestern alumni association, most of the attendees having graduated from a local college and completed their Master's and Ph.D.'s at the Evanston, Illinois school. The following day, the group visited Seoul International School in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, to perform and give workshops on the college experience in the U.S. Then, they put on an hour-long show to the general public in downtown Seoul, an event hosted by the government-affiliated Korea Foundation. Before heading to Hong Kong and back to Chicago, they will hold one more performance at Myungduk Foreign Language High School in southwestern Seoul on Wednesday. Asked if they were familiar with the a cappella scene in Asia, general manager Sam Garcia said besides having performed with two a cappella groups at Peking University in Beijing a few days earlier, their knowledge was limited. But Treblemakers said resolving the lack of information is what inspired the trip. ""That's one of the purposes of our tour -- to experience how a cappella is part of high school or college communities here in Korea, Beijing or Hong Kong,"" Kim Young-joon, a tenor and a senior studying economics, said. ""We're really excited to find out more about it."" Lee chimed in and stressed that they wanted to stay culturally respectful throughout their journey. ""We see it more as a cultural exchange. We're not trying to bring anything here,"" she said. ""We want to share something and take something back."" Although the trip has allowed them to bridge cultures some 11,000 km away from their scenic campus by Lake Michigan, they have also looked inward to do the same. With members from all over the world, including China, Korea and Singapore, they've taught each other lyrics that may be in one's first language but another's second. Gina Strohbach, who has never learned Korean but sang ""Not Spring, Love or Cherry Blossoms"" by the Korean singer-songwriter IU at a fall show, is a case in point. ""We don't assign a song based on, 'Oh, you're the Korean so you'll sing the Korean song,'"" Strohbach, the treasurer and a sophomore majoring in anthropology, said. ""That's one of the things I really like. It's more like the attitude that everyone is gonna learn the language of the song and we're gonna do a wide variety of languages."" Musical arrangements have also defied cultural boundaries and genres. Treblemakers said although they might arrange a K-pop song like K-pop, they could also introduce classical elements, like a round, which staggers two voices singing the same melody, to render an entirely different effect. ""Some of the arrangers have arranged their songs to be similar to the original. Some of us have turned it into a completely different song,"" Kim said. ""It's not necessarily what the song is about, but how we arrange it."" Treblemakers is scheduled to perform next at Chinese International School in Hong Kong on Thursday. After spending three days there, they will fly back to Chicago to start the spring quarter. (Yonhap)",,iu
"[Hallyu power] Pony, trendsetter of K-beauty",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/905550,2016.03.22 16:11,"Celebrity makeup YouTuber talks about beauty blogging, YouTube makeup tutorial production and launch of cosmetics brand Pony -- real name Park Hye-min -- is one of the most popular Korean makeup gurus, with 981,144 subscribers to her YouTube channel. Her makeup tutorials -- in which she demonstrates themed makeup styles, ranging from looks of K-pop female idols and Christmas holiday makeup to everyday makeup for school or work -- have some 700,000-plus views each. 　While her makeup videos are mainly based on Korean styles and Korean cosmetics, they are enjoying growing popularity overseas along with the global ascent of Korean pop culture. 　Her fans are diverse, ranging from hijab-clad Muslim women to K-pop fans trying to emulate the looks of their favorite K-pop stars. She offers English subtitles that are detailed enough for a global audience to follow. Her overseas fans respond by leaving comments in English on her YouTube channel, praising her sophisticated makeup style and easy-to-follow techniques. 　“If there are no English subtitles, I get many comments from foreign viewers requesting them. I think there are more people outside Korea watching my videos than in Korea,” said Pony, in an interview at her studio in Ilsan, Gyeonggi Province, on March 7. 　In Pony’s new studio, which opened in January, hundreds of makeup products that appear in her YouTube makeup tutorials are neatly arranged on a dressing table adorned with glowing LED lights. The shooting takes place in the center of the studio equipped with cameras and other filming and editing equipment that turn Pony’s makeup demonstrations into a well-crafted sequence. 　Pony was an avid beauty blogger with design and editing skills in her early 20s, and has been using her school nickname as stage name ever since. 　She was working as a graphic designer and posting makeup tips online from time to time as a hobby. Using her design sensibility and editing skills, she tried to make her posts as appealing as magazine covers, she said. 　When she posted her portraits with different makeup styles on Cyworld -- a once-popular Korean social networking platform -- people sent her messages, asking her which products she used and how she created those looks. 　“I began to add more information, such as simple makeup tips with the photos,” she said. 　Then she turned her hobby into a profession when, in 2010, she was approached by publishers who suggested she compile her makeup tips and turn them into a series of books. 　“Makeup started getting more fun. I was young enough to try new things. So why not try something new?” she said. 　She published three more makeup books in 2011, 2012 and 2014. Her books have been published in Taiwan, Thailand, China, Indonesia and Japan. One of the series, “Pony’s Special Makeup” (2011) was translated into Japanese, a rare case of a Korean makeup book being released in Japan, where makeup skills are considered to be much more advanced than in any other Asian country. 　In 2013, she launched her YouTube makeup channel, then titled “Pony’s Beauty Diary.” Episodes that featured celebrity makeup makeovers became instantly popular. She re-created the makeup of not only K-pop idols such as members of Girls’ Generation and singer IU, but also global top stars such as Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Kristen Stewart and Fan Bingbing. 　“It takes a lot of practice before the actual shooting of the celebrity makeup style tutorials,” she said. 　The process of making a six-minute tutorial video on a celebrity makeup style takes many more steps than one might possibly imagine. 　She downloads high-resolution photos of celebrities and examines the photos from various angles to figure out what colors and skills are used to create the look. Then she recreates the look on her face, and rehearses more than five times before she is ready to demonstrate for the camera. 　“I have makeup notes. I write details of every makeup style I presented in my books and in makeup tutorials in notebooks, such as what products and colors I used on different parts of the face,” she said. 　She confessed that selecting products is one of the trickiest parts in the makeup tutorial production. “Products I use determine how much my viewers can relate to my makeup video,” she said. 　She seeks to maintain a balance in the use of makeup products, taking into consideration the diversity of the YouTube channel viewers. 　“What I keep in mind is ages and nationalities,” she said. 　“Young audiences prefer affordable beauty items, while viewers in their 30s and older are more curious about global makeup brands at department stores.” 　She mixes affordable and high-end items in her tutorials, targeting both the viewers in their 20s and 30s. 　She sometimes includes products sold outside Korea, such as those available at Sephora, so that her global viewers can easily find the products and follow the steps. 　“Sometimes they complain that it’s hard to find Korean makeup brands in the countries where they live.” 　Pony also tries to present a balanced mix of both strong and soft makeup styles for viewers with different makeup preferences. 　“Mostly, people enjoy watching tutorials showing strong makeup, but then my viewers said they want to see more practical makeup styles. I try to present a variety of looks,” she said. 　Last year, Pony stepped into the fast-changing cosmetics business. She launched her own makeup line through Memebox, a subscription-based cosmetic curation company. Shortly after the release of her makeup line, Pony launched her makeup brand Pony Effect in November 2015. She has introduced basic makeup items such as foundation, powder compact, lip tint, eyeshadow and eyebrow mascara. 　She tried to distinguish her brand from existing brands by including an easy-to-use sponge applicator that she designed. It creates the touch of professional makeup artist, she said. 　“I think makeup should be practical. Every woman deserves a beautiful look and they should be able to create their looks easily,” she added. 　Pony also plans to upgrade her YouTube makeup tutorials with special effects and increase her upload speed to the Internet. 　“I used to do editing all by myself. But now I work with two new staff members. We are preparing for upgraded features for my videos. The videos will be more perfect!” Pony said.

"[Hallyu Power] Digipedi, the duo behind some of K-pop’s oddest videos",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/890685,2016.03.08 15:45,"This is the seventh article in a series that explores the driving forces behind hallyu and the global rise of Korean pop culture. --Ed. 　Seong Won-mo and Park Sang-woo of Digipedi (Digital Pedicure) have risen to become one of the most sought-after K-pop music video production teams, ever since they produced and directed their first music video for Dynamic Duo’s single “Complex” in 2007. 　The two, who have been best friends since elementary school, have taken their airtight bromance and love of art and technology to unexpected success as one of the country’s leading figures in video producing and directing. 　The duo have worked on TV commercials, including local advertisements for big companies such as Beats by Dr. Dre, Samsung and LG Electronics. However the creative minds of Digipedi are best known for their work in the K-pop industry. 　Since their debut music video with hip-hop megastars Dynamic Duo nearly a decade ago, Seong and Park have worked alongside nearly every other big name in the K-pop industry, including Psy, Epik High, SHINee, Orange Caramel, IU, Kara, Zion.T, Busker Busker and EXID. 　Last year alone, the duo was behind more than 15 K-pop music videos including Psy’s highly anticipated “Daddy” and “Napal Baji,” along with Infinite’s “Bad,” Beenzino’s “Break,” Mamamoo’s “Ahh Oop!” and Seventeen and Ailee’s “Q&A.” Digipedi’s music videos have garnered a combined total of more than 205 million views on YouTube. 　“When it came to Psy’s latest music videos, we know he’s this massive hallyu star and it’s not just local fans that are excited and waiting for his new videos. He has fans all across the world watching,” Seong said, during an interview with The Korea Herald at a cafe in Gangnam last week. 　“And although this may have added to our nerves a bit, I don’t think it changed our approach to the production at all,” Park added. “Especially when you compare the nerves and the burden that was on Psy’s shoulders. We did not feel the pressure. Colorful, humorous and memorable were still our main objectives and I think we achieved that.” 　One of the duo’s most famous music videos to date, is without a doubt K-pop girl group Orange Caramel’s 2014 music video “Catallena.” 　In what is still widely considered an unexpected and bizarre concept, the music video features the girl group’s members dressed like pieces of sushi. But the directors’ out-of-the-box oddball thinking paid off. 　Within the first 24 hours of the music video’s release in March 2014, the clip received more than one million views on YouTube. Even those who were not fans of Orange Caramel would have at least seen or heard about the sushi-inspired K-pop video. 　“I think over the year we’ve definitely developed this reputation for coming up with, I guess you could call it unusual concepts and ideas for our videos,” said Park. “I think a lot of people recognized and got a taste of that with Orange Caramel’s ‘Catallena,’ but for us, it is not all about the shock value. I would say that we do really place at lot of emphasis on color. Colors that are eye-popping make for more memorable and stimulating productions.” 　“When it comes to our creative process, we still consider ourselves artists. And while we do receive some input from a group’s managing agency, for the most part, we rely on our own imaginations,” Seong added. “We don’t really have any specific formulas. We sit and listen to the track and from there, inspiration hits and ideas just begin to flow.” 　While their creative process seems arbitrary, Digipedi still manages to crank out an average of three music video productions every month and shows no signs of slowing down. 　The producers recently expanded their megastar client list to include Conan O’Brien, one of the most influential and popular late-night talk show hosts in the U.S. 　While in Korea last month, the American talk-show host took part in a hush-hush collaborative music video project with JYP Entertainment’s head Park Jin-young. Although no details have been made public, Park and Seong confirmed that they were behind the filming of the upcoming video. 　“We can’t release any details, but we did film a music video with Conan O’Brien,” Seong said. 　With hallyu continuing to advance across the globe, Digipedi admits that the possible reactions of international fans always cross their minds now when working on a new project. 　“When we first started our music video careers, hallyu was unheard of and we never really thought about producing something that could translate well on an international level,” said Seong. “Now every time we create a new video, there’s always that thought of hallyu in the back of my mind. I’m not saying that we consider ourselves as having some kind of responsibility to only create ‘foreigner-friendly’ videos, but for sure K-pop’s global popularity is always something we try to keep in mind when producing.” 　“It’s a bit unreal to see our videos on YouTube with comments from people from all over the world and in so many different languages – granted I have no idea what most of them are saying,” Park added with a smile. “But I really think hallyu has changed the game for K-pop and the Korean entertainment industry in a fantastic way.” By Julie Jackson ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2016/03/08/20160308001061_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
"Hip-hop, rap take top trophies at KMAs",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/883556,2016.03.01 18:05,"Hip-hop and rap showed their strength at the 13th Korean Music Awards held Monday at the Guro Arts Valley Theatre in Seoul. Rapper E Sens was the most surprising win of the night, grabbing album of the year for last year‘s “The Anecdote.” The largely autobiographical 10-track album was received with enthusiasm by both rap fans and critics alike, despite the artist being imprisoned for illegal drug use. E Sens is due to be released in October. “The Anecdote” also won best rap and hip-hop album honors. Artist of the year went to rapper Deepflow, whose song “Jakdu” also picked up a trophy for best rap and hip-hop song. Meanwhile, Big Bang was honored with song of the year for “Bae Bae” from their “M” EP last year, as well as best pop song for “Loser” from the same EP and the netizen’s choice award. Four-member band Hyukoh were the only rock musicians to take a top award, recognized as rookies of the year. This year’s Korean Music Awards added a new award for the heavy metal genre, termed the “best heaviness album.” The honor went to thrash metal band Method. The Korean Music Awards, which were first awarded in 2004, were conceived as an alternative to the sales and fan vote-driven systems that dominate most other music awards in Korea. Winners are selected by a panel of music critics, producers and music reporters who judge the works based on musicality alone. The awards cover the rap and hip-hop, rhythm, blues and soul, jazz, folk, modern rock, pop and rock genres.　 The only prizes awarded through public voting are the netizens’ choice awards given to the most popular male artist, female artist and group. This year’s winners were Park Jin-young, IU and Big Bang. Although the Korean Music Awards’ judging system is often compared to that of the Grammys in the U.S., most of the songs that received recognition at the KMAs did not make the major charts throughout the year -- in contrast to the commercial success many Grammy-nominated songs enjoy before being chosen for consideration.

"[M. Veera Pandiyan] Kill the smuggling routes, not the animals",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/875346,2016.02.25 16:40,"It is the fourth most lucrative illegal trade in the world and Malaysia is among its thriving hubs. The global black market for wildlife and wildlife products is estimated to be about $20 billion, ranking below drug smuggling, human trafficking and the illegal arms trade. Over the past four decades, more than 50 percent of the world’s wildlife has been wiped out. In the past, extinctions were largely due to loss of habitat by deforestation and destruction of natural environments, but today, it is also because of the burgeoning illegal wildlife trade. The growing demand for bizarre exotic dishes, trophies and trinkets, and misguided beliefs in traditional cures, are pushing many species to the brink of elimination. Besides being a key link in the animal smuggling route, it is not surprising that Malaysia has also become a major source country for the illicit business. Malaysia ranks 12th in the list of the 17 “megadiverse” countries of the world holding about 70 percent of the planet’s animals and plants over land, freshwater and sea environments. Malaysia has 306 species of mammals, 742 species of birds, 809 species of amphibians and reptiles, 950 species of fish and over 150,000 species of invertebrates, in addition to 15,000 species of vascular plants. But about 14 percent of the mammals are now listed as endangered by the World Conservation Union. More tragically, the Malayan tiger, the national animal featured in the country’s coat of arms, has come under the “critically endangered” IUCN Red List of threatened species. Over the past eight years, the estimated number of tigers in the peninsula has dropped from 500 to between 250 and 340. It has been a dreadful start of the year for the magnificent beast. Since January, poachers have snared and killed two tigers, while a tigress pregnant with two cubs died after being hit by a sport utility vehicle while crossing the East Coast Expressway in Terengganu. In a despicable act of callousness or greed, two motorists who stopped by to gawk at the pitiful creature cut away her fangs before they drove off. Last week, yet another tiger was snared in Tapah, Perak, although the trap, set by an aboriginal, was meant for wild boar. The 170-kilogram male’s right paw was badly injured, making it impossible to be released back to the wild. The tiger, which has since been named “Yeop Tapah,” is likely to spend the rest of its days in a steel cage at the National Wildlife Rescue Center in Sungkai. Another animal on the critically endangered list is the pangolin, or scaly anteater. Its name is derived from the Malay word “penguling,” which means “roll up,” something that the creature does -- into a shape of a scaly ball -- when it is threatened by predators. But its armor is useless against poachers. The insatiable demand for pangolin meat and scales in China is causing the numbers of the animal to drop drastically in Asia, home of four of the eight species. Pangolins have been prevalent in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years and their scales were once also used for armored suits. These days, its meat is also regarded as a delicacy while soup made from pangolin fetus is touted as an aphrodisiac. The pangolin is now the most sought-after mammal in the Asian wildlife trade, and with the drop in the populations across Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos, most of the supply to China now comes from Malaysia and Indonesia. Last Sunday, which also happened to be World Pangolin Day, officers of the Sabah Wildlife Department rescued 25 pangolins and a gunnysack full of the anteater’s scales in Lahad Datu. It was a small success against a losing battle, especially in Sabah and Sarawak. In September last year, Rhishja Cota-Larson, the founder of Annamiticus, an educational nonprofit organization against the exploitation of endangered species, posted a photograph that proved how pangolins were being traded openly. The photos showed a man offering to sell a mother pangolin and its tiny baby at the Sibu Night Market. It is not known if the man was arrested. In Malaysia, like most places in the world, the illegal trade in animals and their parts is still not seen as a crime that is serious enough, especially with the common acceptance of eating bush meat or exotic dishes. But it is this attitude which allows criminal syndicates to use corruption and take advantage of the usually light sentences imposed to keep preying upon wildlife. It is a low-risk business with high returns that leaves only those at the lower levels like poachers and poor indigenous people getting caught while the real crooks who rake in the big bucks get away scot-free. In Malaysia, although Perhilitan now has more powers under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010, it also needs more manpower to be effective in catching poachers and operators of the illegal trade, which is now conducted mostly online, as reported in “Deal Closed in 48 Hours” on Feb. 22. In addition to extending the scope of joint patrols with the armed for¬ces under the ongoing 1Malaysia Biodiversity Enforcement Operation Network, the department’s special unit devoted to investigating online sales of wildlife needs to be beefed up and expanded to all states. Intelligence and public support are the keys to combat the scourge of wildlife trading. As Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora secretary-general John E. Scanlon has described it, the wildlife is the direct result of people’s actions. People are the cause of this and people must be the solution through tackling human greed, ignorance and indifference.

However, his alleged embezzlement and fraud have torn down that image, and it will take Hwang and his business considerable time and effort to recover from the scandal, industrial insiders say. Hwang posted on the company website that he is truly sorry for the situation, but not everything the media has reported is true and he would like to rectify them at a press conference soon. “I will do whatever is in my power to reclaim the damage I have inflicted on many people’s lives,” he said, before disappearing from the public eye. The Mapo police station in Seoul is investigating the case and will decide on referring the case to prosecutors for indictment. This has come as a shock to many people who witnessed the heady rise of the entrepreneur. Hwang in October 2012 established an online shoe store, Shinbal Farm. Before this, he was a popular broadcasting jockey for AfreecaTV, a video-streaming service. He broadcast online games, capitalizing on the emerging e-sports trend in Korea. The company quickly gained attention for its colorful sneakers in trendy designs. Shinbal Farm changed its name to Sbenu ― a compound of “sonic,” his name as a jockey, and “benu,” an immortal bird from the Egyptian myths ― and expanded its presence in the off-line market. Hwang understood the importance of marketing, with endorsements by celebrities ― popular singers IU and AOA to fashion model Song Jae-rim ― and the company even sponsored Hollywood starlet Chloe Grace Moretz’ visit to Korea, filming her trotting around Seoul in Sbenu sneakers. Given his past experience, Sbenu became a title sponsor of a Starcraft online league game. His company even became the official casual footwear partner of popular British football club Manchester United. Hwang was also admired by youngsters for his glamorous lifestyle. He introduced a collection of expensive cars such as the Lamborghini Aventador, Bentley GT and Ferrari 458 on his blog. His love for high-end watches and fashion also created a legion of fans. And these rather excessive marketing strategies worked: Sbenu opened its 100th outlet within two years of operation, posting 50 billion won in sales in 2015, and launched a clothing line for business diversification. Hwang appeared in numerous interviews and lectures, urging youngsters to dream big. He said, “People see me as lucky but I think I am a hard worker.” Things started to fall apart last year when customers claimed that the dyes of Sbenu sneakers rubbed off on other garments or cloths when washing. Some cleaners reportedly refused to take Sbenu shoes for this reason. The company was also accused of copying U.S.-based design firm McGuire Design’s logo for its corporate image. But the real blow was the suppliers’ and franchisees’ claim that Sbenu failed to pay them while spending more than 10 billion won on marketing. The franchisees said Sbenu gave its products to clearance sale stores near their outlets and sold new shoes for a bargain in order to secure cash, which in return has inflicted substantial financial damage to their businesses. One of the suppliers on Dec. 15 raided the headquarters in Seoul while naked, and then hurt himself and threatened the workers to pay him 2.8 billion won the company allegedly owes. But Sbenu’s cash reserves fell to 8.4 million won at one point. Hwang has reportedly sold all his luxury goods. He is now laying low at his office and is avoiding the media or other external contacts. By Bae Ji-sook ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2016/01/19/20160119001082_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Kakao stands to dominate K-pop market with Loen acquisition,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/814191,2016.01.12 17:57,"A seismic shift may be in store for the local entertainment industry after tech giant Kakao’s entrance to the market, upon its acquisition of Loen Entertainment, the operator of MelOn, Korea’s top music-streaming service. 　The big buy, which gives the maker of mobile messenger KakaoTalk a 76.4 percent stake in Loen worth 1.87 trillion won ($1.55 billion) later this month, could open a greater platform for the company to create new music services, on top of access to Loen’s plethora of entertainment content. 　MelOn is already the country’s No. 1 online music-streaming site, controlling about 50 percent of the market with roughly 28 million subscribers, including approximately 3.6 million paid subscribers. The acquisition announced Monday by Kakao, which has roughly 150 million users worldwide, is projected to further increase MelOn’s music streaming monopoly. 　“Once MelOn, which has a market share of more than 50 percent, combines with Kakao’s platform and capital, its monopoly in the music streaming industry will be stabilized and it would be hard for rival music sites to compete,” said one music website employee. 　The music industry here has already been strongly criticized for bifurcating the country’s music content into K-pop music and non-K-pop music, and some music insiders view the acquisition as potentially making it even more difficult for non-K-pop artists, or small-time pop music agencies, to penetrate the market with independent content. 　“When big conglomerates are in charge of distributing content and even control the production platforms of musicians, it will inevitably lead to a big shift in synergy,” a representative of a midsize entertainment agency was reported telling a local news outlet. 　“This makes it nearly impossible for a company like us to grow and establish content independently, unless we move to a big-time music label.” 　By combining forces, Kakao and MelOn are expected to ride K-pop’s popularity in the broader Asian market to further expand and strengthen Kakao’s presence overseas. 　“Music is one of the most loved content genres in the mobile era,” said Kakao CEO Jimmy Rim on Monday. “It is also incredibly powerful in that one song can set trends for an entire generation and highly influence global pop culture,” 　“By combining Kakao’s various platforms and content services and Loen’s leading music content, we expect tremendous synergy that could establish a strong foundation for global expansion,” he added, noting his vision that this new partnership with MelOn would forge the needed momentum for Kakao’s global debut. 　However, aside from dominating online streaming in Korea, Loen Entertainment is also the country’s No. 1 record distribution label and leading managing agency to a number of big-name K-pop acts, on-screen stars, writers and producers. 　The company’s Loen Tree agency is home to popular K-pop starlet IU, while its Starship Entertainment is home to music heavyweights Sistar and K.Will as well as idol boy band Boyfriend. 　Late last year Loen also became the majority shareholder of A Cube Entertainment, buying a 70 percent stake in the company. A Cube is home to Apink and singer Huhgak, and is a subsidiary of Cube Entertainment, one of the country’s biggest K-pop agencies, which manages some of the industry’s top-name acts, including 4minute and Beast. 　In 2013, Kakao made its first foray into the local music market by launching its social networking music service KakaoMusic in collaboration with Bugs Corp. -- Korea’s No. 4 music-streaming site. Following Monday’s announcement, it was revealed that that service will continue after the merger, although many industry insiders remain skeptical as to its continued operations. 　Along with its ventures in the music market, Kakao has established many platforms in the communications and entertainment fields, including KakaoTV, a video sharing platform that offers free Web dramas and video-on-demand movies and that also allows users to watch clips with friends. 　Kakao announced that the initial plan for its music industry endeavors is to fuel demand by adding to existing services and create new music services incorporating social networking platforms.

Seohyun joins star-studded lineup for ‘Moon Lovers’,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/805068,2016.01.06 17:52,"Girls’ Generation’s Seohyun became the latest star to add her name to the cast of upcoming fantasy period drama “Bobogyeongsim: Ryeo (Moon Lovers)” which has already created much buzz with its A-list lineup. The TV drama, based on the 2005 Chinese novel “Bu Bu Jing Xin (Scarlet Heart)” by Tong Hua and its adaptation that aired in 2011, will tell the story of a woman in Seoul who goes back in time to the Goryeo Dynasty. Singer-actress IU has been cast in the role of the leading lady, while the male lead will be played by Lee Joon-ki, who plays a prince. Other actors playing various royal roles include Kang Ha-neul, Hong Jong-hyun, EXO’s Baekhyun, Nam Joo-hyuk and Ji Soo. “Moon Lovers,” which will be completely preproduced, is set to air later this year simultaneously on SBS and in China.

The chart only included full-length albums, rarities in the current Korean music market that is flooded with singles and EPs, and gave credit to artists who crafted records in 2015 based on a firm understanding of their musical identity. Billboard praised the winner “Reboot” as showcasing “the importance of a concept and what happens when an act believes in that concept.” Following the Wonder Girls’ “Reboot,” the list named “4 Walls” by f(x), “Basic” by the Brown Eyed Girls, “The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 2” by BTS, “Wondaland” by hip-hop trio MFBTY, “Chat-Shire” by songstress IU, “The Red” by Red Velvet, “No. 5” by 2PM, “17 Carat” by Seventeen and “Rise as God” by TVXQ.

IU ‘still loves’ song ‘Zeze’ despite pedophilia controversy,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/750841,2015.11.23 16:47,"Singer-songwriter IU stood by a song she wrote inspired by a 5-year-old boy character from a classic novel and for which she was mired in a controversy over pedophilia. At her solo concert in Seoul on Saturday, the 22-year-old singer-songwriter performed the controversial song, “Zeze,” explaining to the audience that she “still dearly loves it.” A track on IU’s latest EP “Chat-shire,” the song is named after the boy protagonist of Portuguese novel “My Sweet Orange Tree.” Its self-written lyrics have been the target of criticism, with some critics viewing them as “hinting at pedophilia.” That the singer had described the character Zeze as “sexy” in a separate interview also became a point of debate. IU was unperturbed, however, as she sang the piece in front of around 6,000 audience members at Saturday’s concert at the Olympic Hall in Seoul, in what was to be the opening of her domestic tour. IU started off the concert with “Shoes,” from her latest mini-EP “Chat-shire,” followed by “Everyone has secrets,” “Obliviate” and “Red Queen,” leading up to “Zeze,” the fifth in the song lineup. People close to IU were present to give her emotional support. IU’s boyfriend of two years, Jang Ki-ha, along with her best friend Yoo In-na and Indie duo group 10cm’s Kwon Jung-yeol were in the crowd. The chanteuse finished off the show by thanking the audience, “As this was the first concert (for ‘Chat-shire’), we prepared hard, and there were things to overcome. I was very nervous but upon coming up to the stage, I saw your smiling faces and felt grateful. You had no worries on your shining faces and that was reassuring.” Following the two-day concert over the weekend, IU will continue on a national tour that stretches to Daegu, Busan, Gwangju and more venues through the end of the year.

‘Man of autumn’ at the peak of his powers,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/725155,2015.11.20 19:16,"Setting off for an interview with singer Choi Baek-ho on a windy late October day, with dry, fallen leaves swirling about my feet, I thought, “What a perfect day for a meeting with Choi.” “Please don’t leave in autumn, but, if you must, please leave in the white winter,” goes a line in Choi’s first hit song from the late 1970s, and he has been known as the quintessential man of autumn ever since. I met Choi at Musistance, an underground music space ― literally underground as it is located in a converted underpass in Ahyeon-dong ― that opened its doors at the end of last year. “It used to be a gathering spot for the homeless in the area. We still get some homeless people coming, not knowing the change,” said Choi, adding that with winter approaching he worries about where those people will turn to for warmth. How this music space for aspiring musicians and indie musicians came about is something of a fairytale, as is the warm, inviting space fully equipped with the latest sound equipment, recording studios, practice rooms and a stage ― any musician’s dream come true. The Culture Ministry approached Choi, who also heads an organization of professional musicians, seeking ways to promote indie music in Korea. Choi proposed creating a space where aspiring and indie musicians would be able to practice, record and perform for a nominal fee. So far, Musistance has organized Independent Project, a contest for independent musicians, and Jugyeongyarak, a contest for amateur bands. A total of 562 teams competed in the Independent Project and at the time of the interview, 10 teams were in the process of recording two songs each for the mid-November final round. Choi, who serves as a mentor to the teams, said, “I see them improve a lot in the process.” Koreans are known for their love of music, but the standard of the amateur bands participating in Jugyeongyarak took even Choi by surprise. “The average age is about 30 and rock is the most popular genre. We had to screen teams that sounded too professional,” said Choi. The final five winning teams of Jugyeongyarak will hold a concert on Dec. 30, a rare opportunity for amateur bands to perform on stage in front of an audience. Choi was 26 when he burst on to the music scene in 1977 with a song that had the mood of a French chanson ― a novelty at the time when the music scene was dominated by traditional Korean pop music. He had written lyrics that people thought were inspired by lost love. “Actually, that song is about my mother. She passed away in autumn and the song is about her. Yes, women did leave me, but not in the fall,” Choi said. After his meteoritic rise, Choi virtually disappeared from the public, reemerging years later in 1995 with yet another hit song, “About Romance,” which is still one of the most popular songs in noraebang 20 years on. If his debut song earned him the label “man of autumn,” “About Romance” made him an icon of middle-aged Korean men, the song their anthem. “That song resurrected me and changed my life completely. The fact that I am still working today, I owe to that song,” Choi said. “About Romance” became a surprise hit when a popular television drama scriptwriter heard it on the radio in a cab, liked it very much, and had the middle-aged male protagonist in her drama sing it in an episode. It caught on like wildfire among the middle-aged men who understood the longing for youthful days and Choi was back in the music spotlight. In the last couple of years, Choi has been collaborating with some of the hot young stars of today, including singer IU and indie band Sweden Laundry. What is it like for the 65-year-old to work with singers from a different generation? “They are not my songs and it is a completely different world. It is like traveling abroad after having only traveled in Korea. I learn a lot about the new feelings, sentiments,” he said. “IU has something I don’t have. Her songs are comforting and easy to listen to, but she knows how to ride the rhythm,” Choi said. “I think singing is 99 percent talent and 1 percent effort,” he added. Choi is also a host of a late-night radio show, which he has been doing for nearly eight years. He doesn’t say much on the show, taking short pauses between songs to read out a message from a listener and offer a short response in his characteristic low, gravelly voice. Sometimes his response to a listener is a “Um, yes,” before he introduces the next song. What explains the long life of a show in which the host does not pretend to entertain? “We play a wide range of music. There is no specific genre, no specific period. And I think people like it for that ― in spite of my voice, which is not easy on the ear,” Choi said. As for his choice of music, he said he goes for “good music,” which he defines as a song created through a lot of hard work. When he is not singing, mentoring, deejaying or playing soccer, Choi paints in his atelier. Before he debuted as a singer as a way to make a living, Choi had planned on studying fine art in college. Today, he often starts painting at dawn and continues for several hours. “I sleep four hours a day. I am a restless person by nature and I need to keep myself occupied,” he said. Trees are the frequent subjects of Choi’s acrylic paintings, the medium he prefers because of the speed it affords. “Painting is difficult. You have to put everything else down and give it your all,” he said. When I ask about his next project, Choi sheepishly takes out a USB stick from his bag. Holding it up, he says, “Movie! I have two scenarios here on the USB that I always carry with me.” One story revolves around a singer working in Misari, an area just outside Seoul famous for its many cafes featuring singers on stage. The other is a pure science fiction. “I was inspired by a Japanese sci-fi comic series. It started in 1987 and there are still only 12 volumes. It took the cartoonist 11 years to come up with volume 11 after publishing volume 10,” Choi said with excitement in his voice. “It has an immense scale,” he said. As for his own sci-fi film, he wrote the story several years ago and is still in the process of polishing it, Choi explained. For the next five years, he sees himself working on his film projects. “This was not in my plan. I am not one for planning. But I am enjoying this work,” he said. “I will be good at it. I am confident,” he said, sounding very much like an excited young boy. As I leave the underground playground for musicians, Choi asks if I can include the need for an elevator at the underground Musistance facility. Currently, it is disabled accessible by chair lifts but a way must be found to install an elevator, he said. “We had a band of disabled people come to practice and it took nearly two hours just to have the band members come down the chair lift one by one. Plus we really need it to move instruments and equipment,” Choi said. By Kim Hoo-ran ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2015/11/20/20151120001375_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
K-pop sweetheart mired in pedophilia controversy,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/733093,2015.11.10 17:53,"IU accused of sexualizing 5-year-old book character in song lyrics Singer-songwriter IU, previously considered K-pop’s sweetheart for her innocent image and vocal talents, has been mired in controversy over allegations of pedophilia in her song lyrics. At the center of the controversy is “Zeze,” a track on the young starlet’s latest album, “Chat-shire,” released last month. The song was inspired by 5-year-old boy character Zeze in the novel “My Sweet Orange Tree,” written by Brazilian author Jose Mauro de Vasconcelos. The song “Zeze,” written from the viewpoint of the orange tree, includes lyrics that some claim are sexually suggestive, such as: “Zeze, hurry and climb up the tree / kiss the leaves,” “If you hurt the tree, bad, bad,” “Take the youngest leaf here / Pick the only flower / Climb up me / Climb up me,” “You’re very naive / but certainly sly,” “You might seem transparent like a young child / but something about you is dirty” and “tomorrow night, will you come see me again.” Explaining the song, the 22-year-old singer has said: “Zeze is innocent but cruel in some aspects. He is a character with many paradoxes, which is why I felt he was charming and sexy.” In the novel, which is featured in the Korean sixth-grade curriculum, Zeze is an imaginative but misunderstood 5-year-old boy who is physically abused by his family and comes to befriend an orange tree. Korean commenters online as well as critics, academics and artists are largely divided over the issue, with some defending the young starlet’s freedom of artistic expression and others claiming a line must be drawn when it comes to literary interpretation suggestive of pedophilia. Dongnyok Publishing Co., the publisher of the Korean translation of “My Sweet Orange Tree,” called IU’s interpretation of the child character “wrong” and raised concerns over a young character being portrayed as a sexual being. “It is a great pity that (IU) considered the 5-year-old Zeze to be a sexual subject. Freedom of expression has to be achieved in light of public sympathy,” the company said in a statement. Some, such as writer and critic Heo Ji-woong, defended IU’s right to freedom of interpretation and secondary creation. “It is not right for a publishing company to offer a strict guideline for literary interpretation,” he wrote on his social media handle, adding, “all literature is continually being newly discovered atop the interpreter’s freedom and capacity.” Novelist Kim Jae-won countered the argument, saying “Taboos exist even in art,” while others pointed out the lack of literary logic in connecting the character Zeze with sexuality. IU has since issued an official apology through social media, saying: “I swear I did not write the lyrics with the intent to sexualize a 5-year-old child.” She further apologized for using the word “sexy” in the context of children, and asked that the character in the song be thought of as inspired by, but independent from, the character in the novel. Even after the apology, outrage persists among some online commenters, who have started a public petition to dispose of all copies of the album. “IU has herself been sexually objectified in the pop industry. ...That does not give her the excuse to sell the sexuality of ... children, who are even weaker than her,” a Facebook user surnamed Han wrote in a lengthy post. Another user, surnamed Kim, pointed to the irony in the public’s willingness to “consume IU’s Lolita-like image” while blasting her for “identifying with” a precocious young character.　 By Rumy Doo ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2015/11/10/20151110001660_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
"S. Korea, China agree to get even tougher on illegal fishing",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/719151,2015.10.30 20:27,"South Korea and China agreed to take even tougher actions to deal with illegal fishing activities to prevent the depletion of fish stocks around the Korean Peninsula, the government said Friday. The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries said the two countries issued a communique earlier in the day in Beijing that aims to better tackle illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities. As of last year 341 Chinese boats have been caught breaking rules. The latest understanding comes after Seoul took flak for not including an IUU clause in the bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) inked earlier in the year. The two sides have been operating a joint fisheries committee for years and there has been a steady decline in illegal fishing activities by Chinese fishermen operating in South Korea's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), although unauthorized operations have yet to be fully controlled. This has hurt the amount of fish caught by South Korean fishermen. Under the latest deal, South Korean authorities will raise the fines they slap on Chinese fishing vessels that violated rules to 300 million won (US$263,400) from 200 million won, and also have the option to directly confiscate the catch from Chinese fishermen instead of handing the matter over to Chinese authorities. In addition, the country will create a database on repeated offenders and provide it to China so they can take necessary action. The two countries then concurred on the creation of a sea check point through which all fishing vessels must cross after catching fish that will make it easier for officials to check if rules were followed. The Chinese side, moreover, agreed to better regulate fishing boats that operate in North Korean waters near the sea demarcation line with South Korea. Such boats have trespassed into waters controlled by South Korea to catch fish and then flee over the demarcation line if they are found to be operating illegally. ""In the past there was nothing South Korea could do about these boats,"" an official said. Besides these measures, South Korea plans to develop a electronic permit system that can be attached to ships operating in South Korean EEZ that will allow authorities to check their identity without having to see paper documents that can be easily forged. The ministry, meanwhile, said Seoul and Beijing agreed on the annual fishing quota within their respective EEZs for 2016 that is unchanged from this year. Under the deal, 1,600 Chinese boats can enter South Korea's EEZ and catch 60,000 tons of fish, while the same number of South Korean ships can do the same in the Chinese waters. South Korean boats, however, rarely venture into the Chinese zone because of low fish stocks caused by excessive fishing. (Yonhap)",,iu
Is the Korean digital music market pushing out artists?,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/718437,2015.10.29 17:10,"Dependence on platforms, charts hindering new songs from reaching listeners This is the second in a two-part series examining Korea’s digital music industry. – Ed. If it’s hard to name more than a few Korean artists who are currently active and not idol stars, K-pop ballad singers or TV discoveries, it’s not because they don’t exist. “There are only two genres in today’s Korean music,” said Shin Dae-chul, head of the Barun Music Cooperative, at a forum in Seoul. “Idol music, non-idol music. The rest is meaningless. ... (The current digital music system) has naturally pushed out consumers in their 40s and 50s, and musicians as well. They can’t work in this system.” Musical artists agree with this. “It’s definitely not a market that’s structured to be favorable for artists,” said the vocalist of an indie rock band, speaking to The Korea Herald on condition of anonymity. The singer said her band, as well as other bands she has spoken to, has had bad experiences with distributors and platforms that were taking artists for granted. “It would be really difficult to get someone on the phone to change incorrect information about us on the site, or to remove our songs altogether.” For a while, she said that her band even considered not distributing their songs in Korea at all. “We don’t even make that much off streaming,” she said, noting that music streaming platforms take 40 percent of the streaming revenue. “We said, we don’t need it, take the songs down.” But there are not many other options for indie artists to make an income, she said. She and industry insiders like Lee Youn-hyuk, head of secretariat at the Record Label Industry Association of Korea, said the way digital music is consumed in Korea is a root cause of why only certain artists can succeed in the digital music environment. “Most people consume music by listening to the top 100 songs on the charts, although that’s difficult to prove quantitatively because every music streaming service is different,” Lee told The Korea Herald in a telephone interview. “Since most people don’t look for songs outside of the top 100, the charts become very conservative. The same songs are consumed over and over again, making it hard for new songs to break in.” As of Thursday, five of the top 10 songs on the real-time charts from Melon, the largest digital music servic provider, are from one album -- IU’s “Chat-Shire,” which was released Oct. 23. Two other songs are from idol stars -- Taeyeon’s “I,” released Oct. 7, and f(x)’s “4 Walls,” released Oct. 27. One song is from a drama soundtrack, and the remaining two are from Lim Chang-jung and Zion.T, both of whom are known for their megahits with each new album. The reason for this pattern of consumption has a lot to do with price. Digital music platforms in Korea all offer unlimited streaming packages at about 6,000 won ($5.25) a month. It is only another 2,000 won to 3,000 won to add unlimited mobile downloads for music. At this price point, consumers do not feel the need to carefully curate their listening choices. “Labels will often talk about switching between distributors in order to gain an edge with platforms, either through playlist recommendations or special mentions,” said Lee. “But even that’s only for artists and labels that have a bit of pull. For new faces, it’s a nonstarter.” While acknowledging the difficulties presented by the current digital market situation, both the anonymous vocalist and Lee noted the artists could also do more on their end to improve the situation. “We write and produce all of our own music, meaning that we sign our own contracts for distribution,” said the vocalist. “That’s the only reason we know all these problems with distribution rights. Most artists don’t know about this kind of stuff.” Lee added that artists in Korea need to study up. “A lot of indie artists abroad do the promotional work themselves. They hire someone to do that for them only when they’ve reached a point in their music where both they and their label can make income together,” Lee said. “You can’t eliminate market economics from music, especially pop music.” “Artists have to know how their music will reach and be consumed by listeners. If they can’t figure it out themselves, they need to know how to find good partners that can help them,” he added.　 By Won Ho-jung ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2015/10/29/20151029001605_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

BoA to kick off 4th season of ‘Hidden Singer’,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/683434,2015.10.01 17:56,"After a ten-month break, JTBC‘s hugely popuar reality game show “Hidden Singer” is returning for its fourth season with singer BoA headlining the first episode. “We weren’t sure that we could come back this year,” chief producer Cho Seung-wook told press on Thursday. “But thanks to the support of those who waited for Season 4 to come back, we were able to be ready by October.” The show, on which established singers are pitted against five fan contestants who are confident they can sing like their idols, has been on the air since 2012, spotlighting 37 singers through three seasons. Past featured artists have included big names like Sung Si-kyung, Baek Ji-young, IU, and Park Jin-young. “Our theme for this season is that this is ‘where singers become true singers.’ Artists get to meet the fans that support them and emulate their singing. They get energized, to become even better singers,” said Cho. According to Cho, the lineup for the fourth season of “Hidden Singer” will include many names that have been on JTBC‘s radar since the show first began. “This season has some singers that we’ve been thinking about since Season 1,” he said, noting that their episodes had been pushed back because “we didn‘t have enough contestants, or their voice was particularly hard to emulate.” Season 4 headliner BoA was also one of those singers that had been placed on hold. “We had a number of timing issues, but this year BoA released her 15th anniversary album and held a concert, which created a nice backdrop for making her the first in our Season 4 lineup.” Cho also said that the preliminary competition for contestants to land one of the five spots on BoA’s episode was one of the fiercest in the show‘s history. “There are so many women from their teens to their thirties who thought of BoA as a role model in pursuing music, or in practicing their singing,” he said. “She’s the original Hallyu star. You‘d think that as a female singer she’d have more male fans, but BoA has a very large female fan base. We had a lot of applicants, and we found the top five.” The show has currently finished taping the first two episodes of the season, with the second episode featuring SG Wannabe‘s Kim Jin-ho. Cho said that a future episode will feature the music of late singer Shin Hae-chul, who passed away due to medical malpractice last year. The fourth season of “Hidden Singer” comes as other countries launch their own version of the show’s format. Thailand has already aired its first season of “Hidden Singer” and received a “good response,” according to Cho. Vietnam is scheduled to begin airing its show in mid-October, and China is slated to start its rendition later this year, or early next year. The first episode of “Hidden Singer Season 4” starring BoA airs on JTBC on Oct. 3 at 11 p.m. By Won Ho-jung ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2015/10/01/20151001001615_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

[Newsmaker] Loudspeakers mightier than the sword,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/638506,2015.08.25 18:11,"Though it came to a close just 15 days after breaking an 11-year hiatus, South Korea’s loudspeaker broadcast along the heavily fortified border proved to be formidable enough to rush a defiant Kim Jong-un regime to the negotiating table and extract concessions. The equipment became idle as of noon Tuesday in line with the two Koreas’ agreement earlier in the day. Pyongyang, for its part, expressed regret over a land mine explosion on Aug. 4 that nearly maimed the legs of two South Korean soldiers. The South Korean military had resumed the broadcasts on Aug. 10 in retaliation against the mine provocation. The North instantly responded with fury, firing artillery shells last week near a loudspeaker erected in a western border town, declaring a “quasi-state of war” and forward-stationing offensive assets and troops in full combat readiness. The apparatus, an apparent source of great sensitivity to the North, had been disassembled and reinstalled according to the relations between the two Koreas since it was introduced in 1962. Before the latest installment, the loudspeakers were pulled out in 2004 as a result of cross-border military dialogue, but were reinstalled in 2010 at 11 spots along the Military Demarcation Line after the communist regime’s deadly sinking of the South’s Cheonan corvette. They were not used at the time. Through them, the South resumed broadcasts of the “Voice of Freedom” show, a rare source of outside news and music for North Korean frontline troops and residents of border regions caged up in the reclusive society. The programs, both before and after the 11-year hiatus, included news of the executions of North Korea’s elite military executives and other power struggles within the top echelons, information about the lives of the South Korean middle class, regional and global issues including human rights and lighter content, such as weather forecasts and music. The program would resonate across the border for three to four hours a day on an irregular basis. Many defectors who resettled in the South have testified that they had first come to know about the South and the outside world through the broadcasts, which can travel as far as 10 kilometers. This means that those walking down the streets of the North Korean border city of Gaeseong may hear the sounds seeping out of the speakers run by the 1st Infantry Division headquartered in Paju, Gyeonggi Province. On Monday afternoon, the broadcast aired nonstop with detailed news of the North’s mine attack and the two Koreas’ exchange of fire, as well as criticism of Kim as a “childish, insecure despot.” “The North Korean army ran away after clandestinely launching a torpedo and plating mines because it knew that it will certainly lose in a head-to-head showdown. It’s sticking to shameful means,” a newscaster said, urging the listeners to “wake up and not to waste their beautiful youth as a slave of the dictatorship.” The program carried four main themes, each aimed at promoting freedom and democracy, illustrating South Korea’s political and economic ascent, recovering national unity and revealing the reality of the regime, according to Seoul’s Defense Ministry. Among the songs most recently played were “Heart” by IU, “Genie” by Girls’ Generation, “Bang Bang Bang” by Big Bang and “Between You and I” by Noh Sa-yeon, officials said. “The content and scripts change every day, though the main topics stay the same,” a ministry official said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. “We try to portray as realistically as possible the South Korean middle class and give the North Koreans hopes for peace and prosperity, while dealing with familiar issues such as friends and hometown and introducing our culture and popular K-pop.” ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2015/08/25/20150825001610_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

Expats jump into Asia's tech hubs,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/593228,2015.07.20 19:51,"Asia is currently the world’s fastest-growing region, and foreigners are beginning to spot opportunities to found their start-ups in Asian countries. “What I’m seeing is a real increase in entrepreneurship and a real increase in mobility, especially among younger entrepreneurs,” said Peter Wall, cofounder of Hubud, a coworking space in Bali, Indonesia. However, it is not easy to set up a foreign start-up across the region. While some hubs, like Singapore, are keener to globalize and attract foreigners, others have a lot of red tape and legal barriers. South Korea has not been the most accommodating place for foreign start-up entrepreneurs either, with complicated visa processes and quotas on foreign employees, as well as a lack of public funding. Despite varying difficulty levels by region, many foreigners are still willing to realize their start-up goals in Asia. “I have this theory that the more difficult it is to do things, the more resourceful you become and the more successful you become,” Wall said. The Korea Herald analyzed 10 regions across Asia on start-up conditions by comparing several key factors, such as start-up trends, incorporation costs and foreigner employment conditions, that would affect foreign entrepreneurs’ ability to found start-ups in the area. Japan The advantages of setting up in Japan are its huge market, solid infrastructure and world-leading robotics industry, says Chiew Farn Chung, the Malaysia-born cofounder of education technology company ClassDo in Tokyo. “The infrastructure is insanely good, the opportunity here is seriously large. You can actually do a lot with the really fast broadband speed,” he added. Foreigners can also set up a company in Japan even without permanent residence through an investor visa or consultant visa. However, Japan’s high corporate taxes and language and cultural barriers may be drawbacks for aspiring foreign entrepreneurs. “As a foreigner, it would be hard to get people to trust you and to work with you, and to invest in you, especially if you don’t speak Japanese,” Chung said. Japanese engineers are less willing to leave their cushy jobs and jump into start-ups in general and, as a foreigner, it would more difficult to earn their trust for them to make that jump. Chung added that the Japanese government barely provides funding or support for foreigners, and when they do it is “more of a hassle more than anything.” Additionally, many Japanese companies do not have global aspirations as the Japanese market is big enough for them. Language: Japanese Costs to incorporate: 1 yen of capital (but should invest 5 million yen, or $40,000, if looking to apply for an “investor/business manager” visa) and 150,000 yen-240,000 yen in fees. Foreigners must appoint a local resident director of any nationality. Hiring foreigners: Foreigners with permanent residence and spouse/child of Japanese citizens or permanent residents can be hired for any job. Foreigners with other residential statuses can only work in a limited number of job categories (includes “skilled labor” and “engineer”). Foreign students cannot work in Japan. Visa: Applicants must first secure office space and have at least 5 million yen ready in hand to invest or hire at least two full-time workers before applying. China China is the second-biggest start-up market and the leading “mobile-first” (first encounter with Internet via mobile) market in the world, said William Bao Bean, partner at global accelerator program Chinaccelerator in Shanghai. “There’s a lot of innovation coming up in China, which is particularly useful in (introducing products to) other emerging mobile-first markets,” he added. There are foreign start-ups across many different industries, such as games, education, business-to-business and hardware. Bean said foreign start-ups in China are mostly concentrated in big cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, although there is a small number of start-ups for gaming in Chengdu and for hardware in Shenzhen. Foreigners do not need a visa to set up and can later obtain work visas through their own company. However, setting up in China is heavily dependent on hiring agents, which is not legally required but “you’d be an idiot not to use one,” due to their ability to circumvent many start-up restrictions. “In China, there is always a way,” Bean said. The Chinese government forbids foreign companies from entering certain areas such as Internet video streaming, payment and media, and there is also a quota on hiring foreigners based on start-up capital, where 100,000 yuan ($16,000) provides visas for five to six foreign employees, and companies must bring in 1 million yuan worth of foreign capital over the next 20 years. Setting up a foreign company in China takes six weeks and costs $10,000, but most circumvent this by registering as a local company via partnership with another local company, which takes half the time and costs $9,000. Another difficulty is competing with Chinese start-ups, as teams often work 72 hours a week with barely any time off for holidays, while international start-ups operate with standard Western-style working hours. “The local competition is so fierce and the international people don’t understand the local market,” he said. Foreign start-ups may also find it difficult to navigate the different user expectations for mobile applications in China, as Chinese apps tend to have more functionalities than Western apps. Languages: Mandarin, Cantonese Costs to incorporate: Setting up takes six weeks and costs $10,000; most circumvent this by registering as a local company via partnership with another local company, which takes three weeks and costs $9,000. Visa: 100,000 yuan provides visas for five to six foreign employees, and companies must bring in 1 million yuan worth of foreign capital over the next 20 years. Foreigners do not require a visa to set up the business, and can later obtain a work visa through their own company. Singapore Companies with global aspirations that want to start out in Asia should try out Singapore, said Maria Kuvshinova, cofounder of Clubvivre, an on-demand chef platform. “Singapore also holds language advantages, as all media is in English,” Kushinova added. Low taxes, transparency and a preexisting entrepreneurship culture have earned Singapore the reputation as the No. 1 place for foreign start-ups in Asia. Singapore is also multicultural with a 39 percent foreign population, which is advantageous as an entrepreneur. “You don’t have to travel anywhere ― everybody is here already,” she said. Processing applications for start-ups is quick and easy, and everything can be done online. However, the cost of living in Singapore is higher than that of most other places in Asia, and foreign employers also need a local partner to register for a business. There is also a quota for hiring foreign talent, which differs by industry. Companies must also pay a “foreign worker levy” for every foreign employee they have, the cost of which also depends on their number and skill level ― putting smaller start-ups at a disadvantage. The government also provides subsidies, but most of them only apply to local companies. Additionally, competition in Singapore is severe for all businesses. “The sunny island really isn’t made for lazy people,” she said. Languages: English, Tamil, Malay, Mandarin Costs to incorporate: Registration fee of S$300 ($220) to the Singapore Registrar of Companies, Minimum paid-up capital for registration is S$1. Paid-up capital (also known as share capital) can be increased after incorporation. Foreigners who don’t reside in Singapore need a local resident director. EntrePass one-year visa is for eligible foreign entrepreneurs with $50,000 in paid-up capital in a local bank and at least 30 percent of company shares. Hiring foreigners: Quota varies by industry. Companies must also pay a monthly levy for each foreign worker. Taiwan Start-ups are uncommon in Taiwan and its prevailing culture does not produce many assertive and risk-taking workers, said Rui Ma, partner of 500 Startups, a seed accelerator program that invests in tech start-ups. However, Ma said that Taiwan has a stable and well-educated engineering workforce, and some of the most active users on social media and high penetration of e-commerce: The Taiwanese Institute for Information Industry predicted in May that Taiwan’s e-commerce market would reach around $32.57 billion this year. “It is on par with Korea and Japan in terms of technology infrastructure, but is cheaper to start a business (in),” she said. Jeffrey Ling, founder of Entrepreneurs Society of Taiwan and Taiwan Country Manager of Korean start-up Toss Lab, Inc, added that the country had a geographical advantage. “It has strong ties to several countries in Southeast Asia, making Taiwan very centrally positioned as a starting point for expanding into other parts of Asia,” he said. The Taiwanese government also launched an entrepreneur visa program for foreign entrepreneurs this March. However, Legislation can also be difficult to navigate as some papers lack an equivalent English version. “There is still no one-stop shop when it comes to information gathering and completion of official procedures,” Ling said. Languages: Mandarin, Taiwanese Hokkien, Hakka Chinese Costs to incorporate: Registration fee: NT$450 ($15) plus 0.025 percent of the company’s authorized capital (minimum T$1,000) No minimum capital requirements for foreigners, but T$3 million annually for work permit and alien registration card Visa: Foreign professionals with at least a bachelor’s degree do not need work experience to join qualifying start-ups. Thailand Thailand’s start-up scene has only been active since 2012, but is already affordable and friendly toward foreigners and tourists, said Amarit Charoenphan, cofounder and co-CEO of Hubba, a start-up coworking space in Bangkok. “Generally, the environment has been hassle-free and welcoming for expats,” he said. Thailand also provides tax incentives and easier work permit processes for tech start-ups. However, a new start-up environment means consumers still have very simple demands despite seeing a boom in social media, as well as a lack of sustainable talent. “There’s not enough available talent pool versus the amount of companies that are out there,” Charoenphan said. Additionally, issues such as payment and logistics are problematic. “They’re building a company based on creaky infrastructure, poor governance (and) law.” Several restrictions for foreigners also exist, such as not being able to hold over a 51 percent stake in a company, as well as having to hire one Thai employee for every foreign one. The Thai government also struggles with a centralized agency to assist start-ups, as tech falls under four different ministries. “You can imagine how messy that is. It’s not easy to consolidate using different agencies,” he said. Language: Thai Costs to incorporate: 0.55 percent of capital for private limited companies. Hiring foreigners: One foreigner for every 2 million baht ($320) of fully paid-up registered capital (up to 10 foreigners). Many sectors are reserved for Thai nationals, with foreigners restricted in the types of business they can run. Permits issued for specific hours and types of work; entire process must be renewed annually. Applications must be in Thai. Visa: Foreigners working in Thailand must have a work permit and the applicant must hold a valid “non-Immigrant” visa at the time. Hong Kong Hong Kong is an optimal place to start a business due to its proximity to mainland China with fewer market and information restrictions, said Simon Galpin, director-general of Invest Hong Kong. Hong Kong has been seeing growth in start-ups from around the world across various industries, particularly in e-commerce, financial technology and hardware. Low taxes, minimal government interference and simple incorporation processes are also an advantage. Setting up a business takes an hour to complete, with only HK$1 ($0.13) required for minimal capital and a director who doesn’t have to reside in Hong Kong. English is also well-spoken in the area. “Hong Kong is a city where East meets West. Local people get along well with expatriates.” Galphin said Hong Kong does not have any foreign employee quotas or any other restrictions, and that set-up costs and procedures are the same for every applicant. “Hong Kong’s free market mechanism means that everybody is treated the same in the market,” he said. The only drawback, Galphin said, may be the competitive atmosphere which foreigners may not be used to. “Businesses need to have very effective marketing plans and cost models in order to survive,” he said. Languages: Cantonese, English Costs to incorporate: About $1,200. Must have at least one director, one local corporate secretary and a physical location in HK, no capital share required. Founding a local company (via partnership) costs $200-$300. Visa: Employment visas for skilled professionals such as software engineers, doctors and research and development specialists. Supplementary Labor Scheme for semiskilled professionals such as technicians. Indonesia “The best thing about Indonesia is that anything is possible. The worst thing about Indonesia is that anything is possible,” said Peter Wall, cofounder of Hubud, a coworking space in Bali, Indonesia. Indonesia, especially in cities like Jakarta and Bali, has become a booming start-up market in the last few years for both foreigners and locals. The Indonesian tech scene also has high levels of English proficiency and people are generally welcoming to foreigners. Current start-up trends for both locals and foreigners are payments solutions, e-commerce and mobile. “The foreign start-ups in Bali tend to work on a global scale and global idea rather than an Indonesian idea,” Wall said. Unfortunately, there is a lot of red tape for foreigners in Indonesia. Firstly, start-up companies are not yet categorized as to whether foreigners can own them completely. “It’s a new industry so we’re not even on the category,” Wall said. Additionally, the incorporation process is difficult, costs much more for foreign companies compared to locals and, according to Indonesian market entry services Indosight, takes around 10 weeks. The Indonesian government mostly views foreign workers as temporary workers to be replaced by local Indonesians in the long run. The government also constantly changes its labor laws, which makes running a start-up difficult. “The work permit situation has constantly been in flux over the last few years, so that’s made it difficult for Indonesian-based foreign companies,” Wall said. Although the Indonesian foreign work permit is for one year, Wall said the government has only been issuing six-month permits recently. “It seems like the rules change frequently and it’s hard to keep track of exactly what’s happening,” he said. Language: Indonesian Costs to incorporate: $1 million over one to three years, with 25 percent in paid-up capital. Hiring foreigners: Only foreigners deemed “experts” in their field can work in Indonesia. Companies employing foreigners must pay $100 per month through the Manpower Ministry. Visa: Need physical office and proof of investment, and must submit investment reports every three months until receiving an “IUT” permanent business license.

‘The Producers’ set to be full of fun and laughs,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/496629,2015.05.11 20:49,"Asian heartthrob Kim Soo-hyun returns to small screen as clumsy rookie TV producer Celebrities switch places with the production crew in the new comedy-drama “The Producers,” as four top-tier stars ― Kim Soo-hyun, Cha Tae-hyun, Gong Hyo-jin and IU ― portray the hectic lives of broadcast television producer-directors. Dubbed “the most anticipated show of 2015” by industry insiders, the new KBS drama will take us behind the scenes, revealing all the craze of overnight editing and endless meetings that go into producing variety shows, and promises light-hearted fun and laughter on the way. The drama marks actor Kim Soo-hyun’s return to television after a one-year hiatus since the mega-hit drama “My Love from the Star.” In complete contrast to his role as charismatic alien Do Min-joon, this time, Kim will play a principled, book-smart rookie producer named Baek Seung-chan, who is painfully inarticulate, clumsy and not at all street-smart. “Everybody was a rookie at some point in their lives,” said Kim in a press conference in Seoul on Monday. “So my goal is to let people relate to my character and remember that time.” “He’s entirely clueless,” said Kim on his endearingly awkward role. “But he tries so earnestly not to be clueless, but that ends up irritating his superiors even more.” In the show, Baek is constantly berated by Tak Ye-jin, the temperamental producer of popular music program “Music Bank.” Played by actress Gong Hyo-jin, Tak gives rookie employees a hard time with her straightforwardness, but is ultimately “human,” said Gong, and does her fair share of comical blundering. “It’s the most aggravated, neurotic role I’ve ever taken on,” said the actress famed for sparking romantic chemistry in dramas like “Pasta” and “It’s Okay, That’s Love.” “In the first episode, there are almost no scenes of (Ye-jin) smiling. She’s dissatisfied with everything, always telling people what to do ... but she’s imperfect and human, and writer Park Ji-eun makes her so charming.” Alongside Gong’s character will be the hot-headed but soft-hearted variety show producer Ra Joon-mo, played by actor Cha Tae-hyun, who is well-loved for comic roles in box-office hits such as “My Sassy Girl” (2001). It was easy for the seasoned actor to imagine himself on the other side of the scene. “I’ve done so many things during the course of my career in the entertainment industry ― I’ve been a singer, an emcee, I’ve done radio and variety shows. I realized I’ve absorbed so much from all these experiences without even thinking about it,” said Cha. Completing the star-studded cast will be singer-actress IU, who will play the haughty pop diva Cindy ― nicknamed “ice princess” for her complete emotional command and icy demeanor. The singer said she observed and took tips from fellow singers to prepare for the role, but was also surprised at how similar the character was to her real-life self. “Everyone has that irritated, touchy side to them,” she said, explaining that she was able to relate to the character’s biting attitude. “But Cindy is not all mean. The more I study her, the more I learn that she’s an innocent soul.” IU added that she is writing a song based on the character. The drama has numerous references to real producer-directors like Na Young-seok and celebrity cameo appearances, including singer-producer and chief of JYP Entertainment Park Jin-young.

Will ban on underage alcohol model reduce underage drinking?,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/491136,2015.05.07 20:40,"A heated debate is intensifying in the alcoholic beverage industry as a revised bill to ban models aged 24 or under from appearing in liquor advertisements is awaiting final approval from the National Assembly. The controversial bill is dubbed by news media as the “IU law,” referring to popular singer-songwriter IU. The 22-year-old has been starring in Chamisul soju ads since late last year. The debate started in 2012 when a ruling party lawmaker proposed a revision to the national health promotion law to ban celebrities aged 24 or less from appearing in alcohol ads. Offenders would face up to a one-year sentence or a 10 million won ($9,180) fine. The bill gathered and was out of the public’s focus for years, until the parliamentary health and welfare committee unexpectedly decided to have it passed. The age of an adult as stated by the civil law is 19, so those who have reached the age can legally purchase and consume alcoholic beverages. But the youth act defines ‘youth’ as those aged between nine and 24. So, should the bill be enacted, young adults aged between 19 and 24 will be allowed to drink alcoholic beverages but cannot promote them in the market. Also, the revision bill would be at odds with the regulations on televised commercial deliberation, which states that those aged 19 or older can star in alcohol ads. Despite controversies, advocates of this bill claim that underaged drinking models may have a negative influence on teenage drinking and thus should be restricted. “Countries such as the U.S. and Britain already have similar bans, and they stop people aged 25 or less from starring in liquor ads,” said an aide to the ruling Saenuri Party lawmaker Rep. Lee Elisa, the initiator of the bill. But Lee’s team admitted that the corresponding overseas regulations are nonbinding and self-regulatory. Attempting to add momentum to the faltering bill, a number of conservative Christian civic groups held a rally in front of the National Assembly earlier this week, demanding quick parliamentary approval. “The frequent appearance of young adults in drinking ads may have a negative impact on teenagers, who tend to value their peers,” said an official of the Civil Solidarity on the Prevention of Addiction. Alcohol manufacturers, however, remained poised, especially as the legislation and judicial committee spoke against the idea, claiming that the effect of the ban was uncertain. The excessive restriction may also infringe on the models’ freedom of occupation, according to the committee. “Even if the law revision did take place, it will take months until actual effectuation,” said an official of Hite Jinro, the nation’s second-largest alcohol company. “Our contract with IU will end by then in any case so we have time to watch the legislative moves and decide on our next action.” Hite Jinro is the manufacturer of Chamisul soju, as well as Hite beer, which had hired figure skating star Kim Yu-na back in 2012, when she was in the disputed 19-24 age group.

Korea removed from EU illegal fishing list,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/468993,2015.04.21 19:03,"The European Union has removed South Korea from its preliminary list of illegal fishing countries, the Ministery of Oceans and Fisheries said Tuesday. “The ministry will thoroughly administer to ensure that illegal fishing activities do not cause any international distrust and concern again,” said Vice Minister Kim Young-suk. Korea was placed on a blacklist that names nations for illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, or IUU, in 2013 after the EU detected Korean vessels operating illegally in West African waters, particularly those off Sierra Leone. The EU pointed out that Korea lacked the efficient control, monitoring system and deterrent sanctions that were in place around illegal fishing. Curacao and Ghana were also put on the preliminary IUU state list for the same issues. To stamp out illegal fishing activities, Seoul government revised its law on deep-sea fishing twice in 2013 and January this year, which included raising the maximum fine for IUU fishing to three times the value of the catch from illegal fishing, according to the ministry. Korean fishing vessels now carry a tracking device known as a vessel monitoring system, which allows satellites to track their movements. Korean officials monitor VMS from a 24-hour monitoring center that opened in May 2014. In February, the United States, which had included Korea on its own list of IUU countries in 2013, also delisted Korea. Once a country is officially named an IUU state, the country’s fishery products may be barred from U.S. and European markets while their vessels are believed to be engaged in IUU fishing and may also be prohibited from making port calls in those regions.

‘Wondaland’ stands strong on music charts,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/429085,2015.03.24 18:39,"“Wondaland,” the first studio album from hip-hop group MFBTY, has made a strong showing on the music charts, nearly a week after its release on Thursday. MFBTY, composed of female rapper Yoon, her husband and rapper Tiger JK and Bizzy, topped the Kakao Music chart for the fourth week of March with one of its lead tracks “Hello Happy.” The other two lead tracks ― “Bang Diggy Bang Bang” and “Make It Last” ― also made it to the top three of the chart. MFBTY achieved rare success as a hip-hop group on the music chart, which is normally dominated by veteran balladeers such as IU, Lee Sun-hee and Lee Seung-chul. The triple lead tracks also ranked in the top 10 of other local music charts, including Daum Music and Cyworld Music, for five straight days so far. The hip-hop trio’s musical “experiment” is winning positive feedback, such as they skillfully fused their own distinctive melodies into tracks of various genres on the album. The 16-track album features a slew of big-name artists from different backgrounds, including rocker Jeon In-gwon, balladeer Yoo Hee-yeol, idol group BEAST member Yong Jun-hyung and BTS leader Rap Monster. MFBTY was formed in 2013 to create “fun music”, with the group dropping its debut album “Sweet Dream” the same year. Yoon and Tiger JK married in 2007 and have a seven-year-old son named Seo Jordan.

Jacobs School orchestra makes Asian debut in Seoul,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/426370,2015.03.22 18:13,"Internationally regarded as one of the world’s most renowned musical institutions, members of the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University’s chamber orchestra made their way to Seoul this week for the ensemble’s first ever concert in Asia since the establishment of the school more than a century ago. In honor of the many close ties that the School of Music continues to maintain with local Korean universities, the chamber orchestra ― made up of 36 musicians, including two faculty members and six native Koreans ― performed at the Seoul Arts Center’s IBK Chamber Hall on Saturday night in front of members of the public and local IU alumni guests. “The Jacobs School of Music is widely considered as one of the finest institutions for the study of music in the world, and many of the most gifted faculty and students have come from Korea,” said Indiana University president Michael A. McRobbie. “South Korea is also home to some of IU’s strongest institutional partnerships. IU is proud to partner with Ewha Womans University, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul National University, Yonsei University and other Korean universities on a wide range of academic endeavors.” This week the school signed a friendship agreement with the SNU College of Music looking to further foster musical cooperation between the two music schools with the initiative of offering both opportunities to exchange faculty and students as well as to collaborate on international music projects. “Of all the countries that have students at Indiana University, after America, the most important for us is South Korea,” Gwyn Richards, dean of the Jacobs School of Music. “Of all the students in the Jacobs School of Music, 8 percent are from Korea.” In the chamber orchestra’s first Asian concert, the local audience was offered a rare glimpse in the world of classical music performance ― a conductorless orchestra. “One things that makes our orchestra unique is that there’s no conductor,” Richards said. “The students have to really focus on their interaction with each other ... they have to listen, they have to make eye contact. What we like about this is that it makes the students take on more responsibility because they have to lead.” “We thought it might be a good thing to bring to Korea because it’s not common,” he added. The orchestra’s near two-hour long performance featured Rossini’s Overture to Il signor Bruschino, Mozart’s Symphony No. 35 and Aaron Copland’s Suite from Appalachian Spring. In a tribute to the ensemble’s inaugural performance in Korea, the chamber orchestra ended the night with ""Springtime in my Hometown,"" an arrangement that quoted the melody of one of the nation’s most beloved folk songs ― “Arirang.” By Julie Jackson ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2015/03/22/20150322000037_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
2NE1 snags Billboard’s best K-pop album pick of 2014,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3631033,2014.12.14 21:04,"As the countdown to 2015 approaches, the assessment of the year’s best songs, albums and industry newcomers is in full swing. Rounding out the year, Billboard’s top picks of the 10 best K-pop albums of 2014 land the feisty K-pop icons of 2NE1 the crown. The ladies’ second full-length album, “Crush,” was praised for cleverly exploring hybrid genres including reggae and R&B and landed them at the No. 1 spot, beating out other much awaited K-pop heavy-weight comebacks such as Seo Taiji and Rain. The magazine referred to opening the album with its eponymous single, which is not the album’s lead track, as a sign that although the group’s sound is maturing, the ladies have not forgotten where they come from. “ ... opening the record with ‘Crush,’ with its bewitching Middle-Eastern vibe and aggressive attitude similar to their signature hit “I Am the Best” proved that the girls know where their roots lie and they’re happy to treat fans while still evolving as artists.” According to Billboard, “Crush” debuted at No. 61 on the Billboard 200, marking the highest chart position and biggest sales week for a K-pop album ever. The album was released on Feb. 27 and came nearly four years after the group’s first full-length album, “To Anyone.” In somewhat of a surprising twist, taking second place on Billboard’s stamp of the year’s best K-pop albums is a band that would not even be labeled as a K-pop act by locals. Popular indie band Nell beat out the likes of K-pop starlet IU for the No. 2 spot with the band’s latest sixth full album, “Newton’s Apple.” Coincidentally released on the exact same day as 2NE1’s album, the magazine referred to Nell’s record as the strongest Korean rock album of the year. “ ... ‘Newton’s Apple’ highlights Nell’s vocalist/chief composer Kim Jong Wan’s clever and honest songwriting skills. ... All the lyrics are wrapped in warm, lush arrangements and instrumentals that enchant the listener simply by themselves,” Billboard wrote. With IU and Seo Taiji taking the third and fourth spots, respectively, rounding out the rest of the Top 10 lists are HA:TFELT (known best as Yenny from the Wonder Girls), Taeyang of Big Bang, B.A.P., Epik High, CNBLUE and Rain’s “Rain Effect.” As for Billboard’s list of the year’s 20 best K-pop songs, Beast took the top spot with the boy band’s single, “Good Luck,” followed by Seo Taiji & IU’s “Sogyeokdong” and G-Dragon & Taeyang’s “Good Boy.” Of course, no Korean music chart would seem complete without one of cheekiest faces of K-pop. Despite his fading presence from the mainstream international spotlight this year, Psy has still managed to infiltrate the magazine’s year-end round-ups with the artist’s 2-year-old viral phenom single “Gangnam Style” being ranked at No. 14 of the year’s most streamed songs. Psy was also listed as the 15th most streamed artist of 2014, beating out global superstars Chris Brown, Eminem, One Direction and Maroon 5.

Romania plugs in music diplomacy,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3630559,2014.12.07 20:55,"The Romanian Embassy in Seoul let music speak the spirit of their national day celebration. The sound of music that filled the reception hall at JW Marriot Dongdaemun last Monday did more than words could do, striking a chord of freedom and unity with the guests. “Anniversaries are opportunities for honoring happiness and recalling memories. It is also an occasion to validate the essence of our ideals,” Romanian Ambassador to Korea Calin Fabian said in an opening speech. “Anniversaries are of a special nature, for contemplating what has been left behind and prospecting our future challenges.” The ambassador left the remainder of the evening to Romanian pianist Ilinca Dumitrescu and bassoonist Vasile Macovei, who played scores of Chopin, Saint-Saens, Porumbescu, Enescu and Popovici. The National Day of Romania, which is celebrated on December 1 every year, marks the union of Transylvanian province into modern Romanian state. On December 18, 1918, an assembly of ethnic delegates congregated in the city of Alba Iulia and decreed the “fundamental principles of the new Romanian state,” which were based on the values of local democratic autonomy and equality for all nationalities and religions. “We also want to jubilate the strategic partnership between Romania and Korea. Twenty-five years after the 1989 Romanian Revolution, we will continue to rely on one another for mutual support and friendship,” Fabian added. The Romanian Revolution in December 1989 paved the way for the country’s return to democracy and European values, ending 24 years of brutal communist rule under dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. More than 1,100 people died during the revolutionary bloodshed that erupted across the country over a week, before Ceausescu and his wife Elena were captured by the military, summarily tried and executed by a firing squad. Romanian history was filled with rich layers of Roman, Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian imperial legacies before the communists took power, Fabian said in an interview with The Korea Herald at the embassy in Seoul. “Erasing and rewriting our original heritage was the first grand project of the communist regime, which sought to replace it with a totalitarian, linear narrative of socialist progress and victory,” he added. Fabian said that Romania, which suffered from the most authoritarian form of communist rule, went onto a wholesale embrace of western liberal values and neoliberal economic policies. “We had to negate our downtrodden past to the same degree that our people’s heritage was appropriated and abused by Ceausescu.” However, filling the vacuum of communist legacy with the “new system of fair competition” was neither possible nor desirable, Fabian stressed. “When I was a geology professor at the University of Bucharest, one of the first things the faculty decided to do was lay off all staff and rehire them, to start clean without communist vestiges. But we quickly realized that this was impossible, as the people under the old system had all the means and knowledge of education.” Fabian emphasized that healing the society’s wounds and reestablishing institutions based on democratic values has been a long and agonizing process. The executive, judiciary and legislative powers of the state which were coalesced by the “cult of personality” surrounding Ceausescu had to be disembodied to establish checks and balances. “Even our darkest days are part of our everyday consciousness after all these years. The key was not to resort to extremism on either side, but to tread the middle ground through compromise and understanding,” the ambassador noted.

S. Korea moves to intensify penalty against illegal fishing,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/283635,2014.11.25 10:55,"South Korea is moving to significantly strengthen its penalties against illegal fishing by its vessels in high seas that include more than doubling its minimum fine for pirate fishing, a government official said Tuesday. Under a revision to the law on deep-sea fishing, already submitted to the National Assembly, the country seeks to increase the minimum fine for illegal fishing to 500 million won (US$448,350), according to the official from the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. ""Maintaining a constant watch against illegal fishing in high seas is not easy as such activities are done in distant waters,"" the official said, asking not to be identified. ""The most effective way to prevent repeat offenses is to increase punishment."" The move also comes as South Korea seeks to erase its name from the European Union's preliminary list of illegal fishing nations. Its efforts have so far included boosting the maximum fine for illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing from 30 million won to 200 million won, along with a fine of up to three times the value of the catch, which had not existed until the latest revision to the law on deep-sea fishing was legislated in July 2013. Under the newly proposed revision, the country again seeks to increase the minimum fine to five times the value of the catch resulting from IUU fishing, according to the ministry official. The United States has also included South Korea on its preliminary list of IUU countries, but its latest report, published last month, noted the efforts taken by the South Korean government may effectively curb illegal fishing. Both the U.S. and the EU are expected to announce their final lists of IUU countries early next year. Once a country is officially named an IUU state, the country's fishery products may be barred from the U.S. and European markets while their vessels believed to be engaged in IUU fishing may also be prohibited from making port calls in those regions.

Sashimi trend pushing ...bluefin tuna to extinction,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/277995,2014.11.19 21:01,"SYDNEY (AFP) ― The Pacific bluefin tuna, a fish used in sushi and sashimi dishes, is at risk of extinction as the global food market places “unsustainable pressure” on the species and others, a conservation body warned. The bluefin tuna joined the Chinese pufferfish, American eel, Chinese cobra and Australian black grass-dart butterfly on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s “red list” of threatened species. The updated list was released by the IUCN at its once-a-decade World Parks Congress in Sydney as it called for better management of protected areas, where some of the decline in species levels has taken place. “Each update of the IUCN ‘red list’ makes us realize that our planet is constantly losing its incredible diversity of life, largely due to our destructive actions to satisfy our growing appetite for resources,” IUCN’s director-general Julia Marton-Lefevre said. “But we have scientific evidence that protected areas can play a central role in reversing this trend,” she added. For this year’s list, the IUCN assessed 76,199 species, with 22,413 judged to be under threat. The Pacific bluefin tuna moved from the “least concern” threat category to “vulnerable” as the species is threatened with extinction due to its use in Asia’s sushi and sashimi markets, the Swiss-based group said. As most of the fish caught are juveniles that have not yet reproduced, the population has dropped by 19-33 percent over the past 22 years. It called for fisheries to implement conservation and management measures for the Western and Central Pacific Ocean.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2014/11/19/20141119000287_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
[Herald Review] Seo Taiji induces ’90s nostalgia with lavish ‘Christmalowin’ return,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3633328,2014.10.19 20:38,"Seo Taiji, one of the country’s most influential musical figures and ’90s icons, finally made his long-awaited return to the music scene with his extravagant live production of “Christmalowin,” the singer’s first concert performance in five years. In commemoration of his upcoming ninth full-length album, “Quiet Night,” Seo’s comeback show at the Jamil Sports Complex’s Olympic Stadium was anything but quiet on Saturday evening. Under the hybrid theme of both Christmas and Halloween, the concert venue offered the rare spectacle of people dressed up in Santa outfits mingling with those who chose the dark side of the spectrum, dressed like not-so-bedazzling witches and bloody creatures that looked to be inspired by “The Walking Dead.” Although the show got off to a bit of a rough beginning, with Seo not taking the stage until an hour after the concert was originally scheduled to start, as soon as the singer hit the stage and opened with the past hit single “Moai,” the crowd seemed to lose all track of time and simply reveled in his presence. After his opening song, K-pop starlet IU took to the stage for a performance of their recently released collaboration track “Sogyeokdong.” Seo followed this with a performance of another of his new singles, “Chirstmalo.win.” Including the aforementioned two new tracks, Seo performed six songs off his latest nine-track album, which is scheduled to be released in its entirety on Monday. As soon as the show began, there was no denying that the music icon kept his promise of creating a blockbuster-like concert atmosphere. Decked out with a giant Jack-o’-lantern and with candy cane-shaped figurines riddled about, the extravagant stage looked like something straight out of Tim Burton’s “The Nightmare Before Christmas.” It was evident that Seo spared no expenses for his highly anticipated comeback in a show that had no shortage of visual effects, flashing lights, beautifully timed fireworks, blazing flames and a booming sound system like none other ― the vibrations from the subwoofers actually tickled one’s skin throughout the night. In order to ensure the best sound quality for the large-scale concert performance, representatives of Seo Taiji Co. had previously revealed that they sought the expertise of famed audio technician Paul Bauman, who has worked on live shows for renowned artists such as Bob Dylan, Madonna, Radiohead, David Bowie and others. From hip-hop to hardcore rock to ballads, the 42-year-old former Seo Taiji and Boys’ leader is arguably one of the industry’s most eclectic singers, often credited as the most influential figure in the development of Korean popular culture and the K-pop genre. Aside from Seo’s new singles, the ’90s icon also took the audience back more than two decades to his Seo Taiji and Boys days, bringing back nostalgic memories of the young superstar with his baggy pants and beanie cap producing songs going up against “the man” and calling out for political and social reform. On Saturday he sang the group’s popular single “My Everything” ― the first time he has performed the song in 22 years. Near the end of the show, up-and-coming local rap stars Swings and Vasco joined Seo on stage, where the trio performed Seo Taiji and Boys’ most iconic hit singles: “Come Back Home,” “Class Idea” and “Hayeoga.” The singer capped off his epic 90-minute comeback concert with a picturesque display of fireworks and an encore performance of “Take Five.” By Julie Jackson ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2014/10/19/20141019000038_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Seo Taiji reveals personal side on TV,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3632758,2014.10.12 20:35,"Less than a week before legendary ’90s K-pop icon Seo Taiji is slated to perform his highly anticipated comeback concert on Saturday, the singer continues to prep and hype the public with his return to the limelight. Seo appeared on the popular KBS2 TV program “Happy Together 3” last week, giving the public a rare glimpse into his personal life as he talked about the birth of his daughter and his surprise marriage with the lesser-known actress Lee Eun-seong last year. Following the announcement of his long-awaited return to the public eye, the singer has been dominating music headlines over the past several months, publicizing random sneak tidbits of his upcoming album “Quiet Night,” and a large-scale concert performance. After his months of hinting, Seo finally unveiled both versions of “Sogyeokdong,” the prerelease singles off his soon-to-be-released ninth studio album. It was previously announced that the single would come in two versions; the first version of the track was performed and sung by popular K-pop starlet IU and was released online on Oct. 2, while the second version, sung by Seo himself, was released 10 days later on Friday. The vintage-sounding electronic pop song features the artist’s classic soft-spoken ballad vocals and in just two days, the track’s music video had racked up more than half a million views on YouTube. Seo and IU’s agencies said they had been secretly working on the track for months, trying to keep fans in the dark as much as possible about the collaborative project. IU’s version went on to top all nine major online music charts shortly after its release, while Seo’s release marks a comeback after a five-year hiatus. The 42-year-old former Seo Taiji and Boys’ leader, who is often credited as one of the most influential figures in the development of Korean popular culture and the K-pop genre, is now gearing up for what is expected by many to be one of the biggest K-pop concerts of the year. Seo’s concert will be held in Seoul on Oct. 18 at the Jamsil Sports Complex’s Olympic Stadium. The show is said to be a Christmas-Halloween theme fusion concert titled “Christmalowin,” with Seo Taiji Co. officials previously stating that they are pulling out all the stops for the upcoming concert, which they have referred to as a “blockbuster” event. Last week, officials revealed that IU will also be joining Seo on stage for a collaborative performance of the two’s “Sogyeokdong” single. Although his “Quiet Night” album is not slated to be released until Oct. 20, the singer is expected to perform the tracks of his new album live at his concert for the first time, as well as perform some of Seo Taiji and Boys’ most iconic hits such as “Come Back Home,” “Hayeoga” and more. Following the Seoul concert, the musician is expected to host a number of concerts nationwide.

U.N. forum to discuss DMZ biodiversity,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3632333,2014.10.07 21:15,"The United Nations biodiversity conference underway in Pyeongchang, Gangwon Province, is set to highlight the ecosystem in the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas. One of the key global symposiums on environmental cooperation, the international DMZ forum is scheduled to convene Wednesday at the Alpensia Convention Center in Pyeongchang, according the Korean secretariat of the 12th meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity. “Four parties will propose a sustainable development model by adopting a declaration of cooperation on the conservation of border areas including the DMZ,” said local secretariat director general Kim Sang-hoon. He said the parties are the organizing committee, the Ministry of Environment of South Korea, international organizations and regional countries. Among the speakers will be Environment Minister Yoon Seong-kyu, Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae, National Institute of Ecology president Choe Jae-chun, CBD executive secretary Braulio Ferreira de Souza Dias and IUCN Biodiversity Conservation Group global director Jane Smart. National Institute of Ecology president Choe Jae-chun will deliver a speech on the values and implications of Korea’s DMZ conservation. In his press release, Choe stressed “the DMZ is no longer a land of the Koreans only. It belongs to humanity and shares the right to enjoy the benefits that are gained through protecting biodiversity.” He said that “if the unification process is hastened without proper preparation for the protection of its wildlife, the DMZ will lose its merit as a rare repository of biodiversity.” Choe aims to make the DMZ project an agenda of the Presidential Committee on the Preparation for Reunification: “The 12th CBD meeting could provide us with an excellent opportunity to promote the concept and plans for the establishment of the DMZ Eco-Peace Park.” Green Belt Germany director Kal Frobel is scheduled to compare the DMZ and German Green Belt during his speech. “Both GGB and DMZ, which are linear structures created for political or military reasons, have been for long untroubled by human land use,” Frobel wrote in his research report. “As a result, these borders ― despite their horribleness to people ― became irreplaceable retreats for biodiversity.” He added the DMZ also mirrors a typical and broad variety of Korean landscapes, from the coastal ecosystems and mountains in the east to the wetlands and estuaries of the Hangang and Imjingang rivers in the west. UNESCO Regional Science Bureau for Asia and the Pacific deputy director Shahbaz Khan said the needs for transboundary conservation have also been raised due to the development of conservation concepts and practices. Hahn Kwang-bok, president of the Korea DMZ Institute, is to deliver a presentation on the past, present and future of the zone. “The DMZ reveals how human beings, ruined by war, with persisting interference from the Cold War, coexist with nature,” Hahn wrote in his report. Catholic University of Korea professor Cho Do-soon plans to propose that both the North and South Korean sides of the DMZ, each with an area of 500 square kilometers, be designated as a nature preserve by the natural monument system of both the North and the South. “Also we have to try to establish one or several national parks comprised of the DMZ and nearby civilian control zones,” Cho said in his press release. Hallym University professor Kim Chae-han believes that “This biodiversity preservation is not the intended purpose of the DMZ but rather a positive manifestation of the military confrontation.” In his media release, Kim said that many environmental activists are afraid that the DMZ ecosystem will be destroyed by the frequent exchanges that may result from inter-Korean reconciliation or even reunification. Meanwhile, in her keynote speech at the 69th U.N. General Assembly on Sept. 24, 2014, President Park Geun-hye declared her plan to build a world eco-peace park in the DMZ. She said that this park would become the starting point to reconnect nature and a people who have been divided for over 60 years. She then made a plea for support from the U.N. and the international community. About 20,000 participants are expected to attend the 12th meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity, slated for Sept. 29-Oct. 17. The Korean secretariat predicts that the number of participants will surpass that of previous conventions: around 16,000 in Hyderabad, India, in 2012 and 13,000 in Nagoya, Japan, in 2010. The Convention on Biological Diversity was signed by more than 150 nations at the Rio “Earth Summit” in 1992 to propel sustainable development. The coming Pyeongchang Road Map will include enhanced mechanisms for technical and scientific cooperation, capacity-building, financial resources, and the integration of biodiversity into development plans and other national processes. To facilitate the implementation of the road map through strengthened technical and scientific cooperation, South Korea plans to propose a BioBridge Initiative, effectively linking technological and scientific capacities as well as financial resources in advanced countries to the need for science and technology in developing countries.

The meetings were held at 1:30 p.m and 6 p.m., and the 5,000 and 10,000 tickets alloted for the events sold out quickly, according to Jung’s agency FNC Entertainment. The fan meeting started off with a performance of Jung’s self-composed song “Feeling.” During the show, Jung sang various songs requested by his fans prior to the event, including other songs written by Jung such as “Monday,” “Try Again, Smile Again,” “Because I Miss You” and “You’ve Fallen for Me” from the original soundtrack of his drama “Heartstrings.” Jung also put on special events for his fans, imitating romantic scenes from “Heartstrings” and showing video clips of greetings from his celebrity friends, including singer IU, Lee Joon of MBLAQ and actress Yoon Eun-hye. The 25-year-old heartthrob gained fast popularity worldwide by appearing in both dramas and music. His group CNBlue recently released its album “Wave” in Japan, which instantly topped the Oricon chart upon its release. Jung is also currently acting in tvN’s drama “The Three Musketeers,” playing Park Dal-hyang, one of the main characters.

Asians eating anteaters to extinction: conservationists,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3824106,2014.07.29 20:36,"The scaly anteater, which looks like an artichoke with legs and a tail, is being eaten out of existence as its tasty meat is served up at banquets across Asia, conservationists said Tuesday. The mysterious mammal, also known as a pangolin, is the prey of poachers with more than 1 million believed to have been snatched from the wild in the past decade. “In the 21st century we really should not be eating species to extinction ― there is simply no excuse for allowing this illegal trade to continue,” said Jonathan Baillie, cochair of the pangolin specialist group of the IUCN Species Survival Commission. “All eight pangolin species are now listed as threatened with extinction, largely because they are being traded to China and Vietnam,” he said in an statement from the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The illegal trade is flourishing for, besides being a luxury food, pangolin scales are also used in Chinese medicine to treat conditions such as psoriasis and poor circulation. In fact, this scaly anteater has become the world’s most illegally traded mammal, which has led the IUCN to step up conservation efforts in Asia and also Africa where traders are turning to meet the growing demand. “A first vital step is for the Chinese and Vietnamese governments to conduct an inventory of their pangolin scale stocks and make this publicly available to prove that wild-caught pangolins are no longer supplying the commercial trade,” said Dan Challender, the other cochair of the specialist group based at the Zoological Society of London. Conservationists want to save the pangolin from the dinner table and the annals of extinction as they are highly evolutionarily distinct. Extinction would wipe out 80 million years of evolutionary history. (AFP)",,iu
EU delays decision on Korea’s IUU fishing status,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3823780,2014.07.24 21:08,"The European Union’s legislative commission on Wednesday postponed its decision on whether to designate South Korea as a country conducting illegal deep-sea fishing on the heels of heightened efforts from the local government to hold off related sanctions. “After the European Commission had warned three countries ― Curacao, Ghana and South Korea ― that they were not doing enough to fight illegal fishing in November 2013, it will now grant each country an extra six months. The Commission will review their progress made at the end of this period,” the EU said. Given another six months, Korea may be able to “improve the situation” and possibly even deter the EU-led sanctions against fishery product exports to EU member states that would lead to losses exceeding $100 million per year, the commission said. In November, the country was issued a preliminary identification, indicating that it was accountable for illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities in West African waters. If designated an illegal fishing nation, Korean vessels would be prohibited from entering EU state ports, in addition to being subject to an export ban. Experts also said the designation could trigger other countries including the U.S. to follow suit. The U.S. has put Korea on its preliminary list of illegal fishing states and is expected to make a final decision in October. Since June, when an EU delegation visited here for a final review, local authorities have been working to fight illegal fishing. They recently prosecuted 22 Korean vessels believed to have conducted illegal fishing activities, while also tightening the Distant Water Fisheries Development Act. Under the revision, illegal fishing can result in a fine of up to 5 million won ($4,900), while ship operators would lose their licenses if caught a third time. By Bae Ji-sook ()",,iu

g.o.d. makes grand return with new LP ‘Chapter 8’,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3638515,2014.07.08 20:21,"Veteran idol group sweeps local charts with new album Veteran K-pop idol group g.o.d. unveiled its much-anticipated LP “Chapter 8” on Tuesday, officially marking the return of the five original members and their reunion after being apart for 12 years. Immediately upon its release, the new album swept the nation’s music charts. Title track “Story of Our Lives (feat. Megan Lee)” became the No. 1 song and several others made the top 10 list on major music websites such as Melon, Bugs Music, Naver Music and more. “Chapter 8” was released in commemoration of g.o.d.’s 15th anniversary. The album was co-produced by renowned producer Double Kick and g.o.d. vocalist Kim Tae-woo. They chose to present music that is “truly representative of g.o.d.” and “able to appeal to people of all ages,” according to g.o.d.’s agency SidusHQ. Numerous tracks on the album bring back the group’s original sound and signature musical colors, defined by the soaring vocals of Kim Tae-woo, Son Ho-young, Danny Ahn and Yoon Kye-sang alongside Park Jun-hyung’s unique rapping. One of four lead singles “Story of Our Lives,” featuring vocalist Megan Lee from MBC’s “Star Audition: The Great Birth,” is a warm tune about expressing due appreciation for family, whom many tend to forget as they get on with their lives. The opening instrumental track “5+4+1+5=15,” recorded by the Czech National Symphony Orchestra, looks back on g.o.d.’s musical history. Excerpts from past hits including “Sky Blue Balloon,” “Dear Mother,” “I Love You and Remember,” “Lie” and “Road” can be heard alongside witty narrations by g.o.d. members. Another lead single “Saturday Night” is an upbeat song filled with pop-groove sounds reminiscent of “Friday Night” from the group’s second album “Chapter 2.” “An Ordinary Day,” originally recorded on the group’s 6th album without Yoon Kye-sang, was remade for the new album, this time including all five original members. “Sing For Me” is a collaboration between g.o.d. and popular vocalist IU, showcasing sweet melodies, vocal harmonies and playful narrations. “The Lone Duckling” and “Sky Blue Promise,” g.o.d.’s chart-topping tracks revealed last month prior to the LP’s release, are included on “Chapter 8” as well. Given the album’s high popularity and heightened interest from a large number of fans, SidusHQ said the group may appear on-screen over the next few weeks. “g.o.d. may potentially be making television appearances after wrapping up their Seoul concerts,” said the agency. “The members will most likely feature on music programs, though not music ranking programs.” Meanwhile, g.o.d. will kick off its nationwide 15th anniversary reunion concert tour with two performances on July 12 and 13 at the Auxiliary Stadium at Sports Complex in Jamsil, Seoul. The five idols will continue with performances in Gwangju on Aug. 2-3, Busan on Aug. 15-16, Daegu on Aug. 23-24 and Daejeon on Aug. 30-31. Pop group g.o.d. (Groove Overdose) is considered one of the most famous K-pop boy bands in South Korea. The group first debuted in 1999 with the single “Dear Mother” and shot to stardom with major hits such as “Lie” and “One Candle,” garnering a large number of fans at the time. Yoon Kye-sang left g.o.d. in 2002, after which the remaining four members released a seventh studio album “Into the Sky” in 2005 and parted ways the following year to pursue individual careers under separate management agencies.

Faith trumps birth control in U.S. ruling,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3637911,2014.07.01 21:06,"Washington (AFP) ― Family-owned private companies can deny birth control coverage in their employee health care plans, the U.S. Supreme Court said Monday in a ruling seen by some as a victory for religious freedom. In a 5-4 decision, the court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby, an Oklahoma-based chain of arts and crafts stores whose devout Christian owners, the Green family, balked at implementing the contraception portion of President Barack Obama’s health care reforms. “Our family is overjoyed by the Supreme Court’s decision,” said Hobby Lobby co-founder Barbara Green as anti-abortion activists cheered the outcome at the Supreme Court steps. “The Court’s decision is a victory not just for our family business, but for all who seek to live out their faith,” added Green in a statement. It was the first legal test of specific provisions of the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, which seeks to extend health insurance to all Americans ― and which the Supreme Court in 2012 deemed constitutional. Under Obamacare, religious employers ― notably the Roman Catholic Church, which fiercely opposes contraception ― don’t have to include birth control in their employee health care plans. The Obama administration had argued that Hobby Lobby, as a corporation with 500 stores and 13,000 employees nationwide, couldn’t claim a similar exemption due to the religious beliefs of the Green family that owns it. “Today’s decision jeopardizes the health of the women who are employed by these companies,” said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. “As millions of women know firsthand, contraception is often vital to their health and well-being.” Central to Monday’s ruling was the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 law that bars the federal government, from doing anything that “substantially burdens” an American’s right to exercise their faith, without a compelling reason, Had they refused to comply, Hobby Lobby and a second plaintiff, a Pennsylvania wood-working firm owned by a Mennonite family, would have faced fines as stiff as $1.3 million a day. “If these consequences do not amount to a substantial burden, it is hard to see what would,” said the ruling, written by Justice Samuel Alito, which defined Hobby Lobby as a “closely-held” business firmly in the hands of the family that built it. In a strongly-worded dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said Congress didn’t adopt the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as a way to accommodate the beliefs of profit-making corporations. “Until today, religious exemptions had never been extended to any entity operating in ‘the commercial, profit-making world’,” she said, a view that her two fellow female justices shared. Mark Rienzi of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the law firm that represented Hobby Lobby, noted that the ruling concerns “small” family-owned companies, not large corporations. “Over the past few years, the court has been very strong on religious liberties,” the lawyer added in a conference call with reporters. But Elizabeth Wydra, chief counsel of the Constitutional Accountability Center, said Monday’s ruling could open a legal can of worms, as well as deny birth control coverage to “tens of thousands” of American women.” “While the court purports to limit its ruling to closely-held corporations on this issue only, the majority opinion invites a number of ‘me, too’ religious objections by other companies on matters ranging from antidiscrimination law to other medical procedures such as blood transfusions or vaccinations,” she told AFP. Obamacare mandates coverage for 20 forms of birth control, but the Greens strongly objected to four ― two types of morning-after pills and two types of intrauterine devices, or IUDs ― which they considered akin to abortion. Earnest said Obama “believes that women should make personal health care decisions for themselves rather than their bosses deciding for them.” He also called on Congress to take action to help women get essential services that may have been ruled out by the court’s ruling. Hobby Lobby ― which, unusually for an American retailer, closes its stores on Sundays ― credits “God’s grace and provision” for its economic success.",,iu
Emperor penguins waddling to extinction due to global warming,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3823533,2014.06.30 19:32,"PARIS (AFP) ― Global warming will send Antarctica’s emperor penguins into decline by 2100, scientists projected Sunday, and called for the emblematic birds to be listed as endangered and their habitat better protected. The world’s largest penguin species came to global fame with a 2005 documentary, “March of the Penguins,” portraying their annual trek across the icy wastes, and the 2006 cartoon movie “Happy Feet.” The new study sheds light on the birds’ reliance on sea ice for breeding and raising their young. The ice also protects their prey ― fish and krill ― by maintaining the food chain. Declining sea ice caused by climate change would place all 45 known emperor penguin colonies into decline by 2100, according to the population simulation. “At least two-thirds (of colonies) are projected to have declined by (more than) 50 percent from their current size” by the end of the century, said the paper published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Dynamics differ between colonies, but “the global population is projected to have declined by at least 19 percent,” after growing 10 percent up to 2048, it added. The team said colonies located between the eastern Wedell Sea and the western Indian Ocean will see the biggest declines, while those in the Ross Sea will be least affected. In fact, the Ross Sea penguin population will continue to grow until 2100, after which the trend will reverse. “Our results indicated that at least 75 percent of the emperor penguin colonies are at least vulnerable to future sea ice change, and 20 percent will probably be quasi-extinct by 2100,” the paper said. Given these findings, the emperor penguin “is fully deserving of endangered status due to climate change,” the team said ― referring to the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species. The bird is currently listed as “stable” by the IUCN’s species bible.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2014/06/30/20140630000359_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

[Lee Jae-min] A red card from Brussels?,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3823181,2014.06.24 20:44,"As the Europeans fumble for a red card, Korea is mounting all-out efforts to avoid it. All government agencies are being mobilized to talk the EU out of issuing a red card. The issue at hand is IUU (Illegal, Unreported or Unregulated) fishing, and the EU still seems skeptical of Korea’s plan to eradicate it. A yellow card was already handed to Korea in November last year when Brussels included Seoul on its preliminary list of IUU fishing countries along with Ghana and Curacao, a Dutch island in the West Indies. Brussels has been of the view that Korean fishing vessels have been engaged in IUU fishing activities while the Korean government has looked the other way. IUU fishing is an illegal fishing activity which is by far the worst type of human maritime behavior universally condemned by the global community. In FAO jargon, IUU is public enemy number one. The EU delegation’s visit to Korea in mid-June was to confirm if a red card should be issued to Korea for failure to respond to IUU fishing activities. A red card here would mean an import ban for Korean fisheries products and a port entry ban for Korean vessels, a significant blow to the Korean fisheries industry. Furthermore, the negative publicity would be immense: The country will be branded as a hub for destructive fishing. A final decision by the EU will be issued by September this year. Although largely unknown to the general public, 2013 was the year that set off an alarm for Korean distant water fisheries activities. In January 2013, the United States issued a list of 10 IUU fishing countries including Korea. The EU then followed in November by designating Korea, though preliminarily, as an IUU fishing country along with Ghana and Curacao. Among a dozen or so countries listed on the U.S. and EU lists, Korea is the only major fishing country. By all accounts, Korea’s name just stands out from the pack and cries for attention. As has been observed by domestic media on the occasion of the EU delegation’s visit ten days ago, the issue is not merely about the possibility of a reduction of exports as a result of an EU import ban. The real and long-lasting damage is the negative image to be imprinted from this final designation of IUU fishing. Few realize how damaging it is to carry the tag of an IUU fishing country. Some NGOs almost treat this activity as on par with modern-day piracy in that it extorts crucial maritime resources from developing countries. There is no question that IUU fishing is one of the major culprits of the global depletion of fish stocks. It is also absolutely unquestionable that global efforts to combat IUU fishing cannot be delayed any longer. Time is running out fast. Also, it is a pity that Korea has not done its homework since 2011 when this issue first surfaced. No one would dispute the fact that Seoul needs to take this issue seriously and find a way to enforce its laws effectively. That said, however, it begs a question why Korea is the only major fishing power that has been included on these IUU lists, while other major fishing countries are left out. This is difficult to reconcile with recently released reports that discuss IUU fishing activities of other major fishing countries as well. Merely canvassing anecdotal evidence of IUU fishing of a country followed by some unilateral sanction may not be sufficient to offer an accurate picture of the problem. Rather, a global scheme to detect and eradicate IUU fishing should be explored. In the meantime, watchers are holding their breath waiting for a final decision from the EU after the recent verification visit. Whatever decision the EU makes will also significantly affect that of the United States.

"Ulala Session song featuring late Lim, IU out next week",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3823116,2014.06.24 20:33,"A new single will be unveiled next week sung by Lim Yoon-taek, the late leader of male vocalist group Ulala Session, that was recorded before his death. The upcoming song is a collaborative track by the five original members of Ulala Session ― consisting of Lim, Kim Myung-hoon, Park Seung-il, Park Kwang-sun and Koonzo (who joined the group in 2012) ― and popular female singer IU. The single contains the voice of Lim, who passed away last year after battling gastric cancer for several years. Titled “Anxious Heart,” the collaboration is a bright and harmonious song that fuses the different vocal colors of Ulala Session and IU, according to Ulala Company. It was recorded back in 2012, while Lim was receiving treatment and fighting cancer, according to officials. Though the song had been scheduled to release in 2013, it was put on hold indefinitely following Lim’s death in February 2013. The song’s producer, The Lyrics, decided to delay the track’s release to the following year, in the hopes that Lim’s passion for music would not be tainted by commercial concerns. The new single is slated to hold a special meaning for many fans of Lim and Ulala Session, given that it is Lim’s last official track recorded before his death. Ulala Session rose to prominence after winning Mnet’s audition program “Superstar K” in 2011. The group impressed viewers with its soulful vocals and impressive performances, becoming the talk of the town during the show’s running.

[Editorial] Illegal fishing,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3640976,2014.06.11 20:25,"Korea should avoid being stigmatized It is lamentable that Korea faces a ban on exporting its fish and fishery products to member countries of the European Union for its failure to fully cooperate in fighting “illegal, unreported and unregulated” fishing. Last November, the European Commission preliminarily identified Korea as a noncooperating country in fighting IUU fishing, citing its failure to properly monitor its fishing fleet, punish vessels engaged in illegal fishing and enact robust fisheries laws. An inspection team from the commission came to Korea earlier this week to evaluate the nation’s vessel monitoring system and check whether its sanctions against illegal fishing operators were in compliance with international standards. Based on the team’s findings, the commission will make a final decision in September. Korea would suffer serious economic and diplomatic losses should the commission brand it as a noncooperating country. First, Korea would be banned from exporting fish and fishery products, amounting to $100 million a year, to EU countries. On top of this, Korean vessels would be denied access to EU ports. Furthermore, the commission’s decision could have a negative effect on the United States’ evaluation of Korea. The U.S. issued a yellow card to Korea in January last year ahead of the EU and is to announce its final decision early next year. More than anything else, the IUU fishing country designation would be a humiliating stigma to Korea, given its high profile in the global economy. To avoid being stigmatized, Korea has taken a set of measures since early last year. For instance, it revised the Distant Water Fisheries Development Act in July last year, following recommendations from the EU. This year, Korea launched an advanced vessel monitoring system. All of the nation’s 339 distant fishing vessels have been equipped with an electronic device so that the Fisheries Monitoring Center in Busan can keep track of them. But these efforts have failed to impress EU officials. The European Commission reportedly remains unconvinced of Korea’s commitment to combating IUU fishing. So Korea’s fishery officials proposed tougher sanctions against illegal fishing operators and other improvements to the EU delegation, which wrapped up its on-site inspection Wednesday. Whether Korea’s last-ditch efforts will work or not remains to be seen. Korean officials may feel hard done by. But they have no one but themselves to blame. They had enough time to address the problems but failed to do so. Korea should redouble its efforts to fight illegal fishing as it depletes fish stocks, hurts the marine environment and jeopardizes the livelihoods of vulnerable communities.",,iu
Korea-EU ties can control IUU fishing,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3640691,2014.06.08 21:17,"The delegation from the Directorate General for Maritime and Fisheries of the European Commission is scheduled to visit Korea on June 9 for an on-site evaluation mission on the country’s control system over South Korean-flagged distant water fleets. The visit is expected to influence the European Union on determining whether to designate South Korea as a non-cooperating third country in the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated, also known as IUU, fishing. The European Union issued a Commission Decision giving Korea a “yellow card,” preliminarily identifying the country as a non-cooperating third country, last November. The European Union has been concerned that Seoul has not been proactive in bringing IUU fishing activities under control, and the country’s passive response to the issue could lead to the inflow of illegal fishing products into the European markets. If South Korea gets IUU acknowledgement, its fish products will be banned from sales or distribution in EU member states, which have been upping efforts to prevent illegal fishing that is destroying the marine ecosystem and distorting the market. The European Union and South Korea have engaged in close cooperation to eliminate IUU fishing through formal and informal correspondences, bilateral consultations and field inspections. Korea has taken various actions, including amending its Distant Water Fisheries Development Act, taking into serious consideration the recommendations made by the European Union. Seoul also had all of the country’s distant water fishing vessels, totaled at 339, fitted with a functioning vessel monitoring system, or VMS, and in March opened the Fisheries Monitoring Center that incorporates the country’s advanced IT technology to monitor the activities of these vessels. A vetted expert of the IMCS Network, a law enforcement official from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a scientist from the New Zealand Institute for Water and Atmosphere recently visited the FMC and commented that the Center has sufficient capabilities, comparable to those of European countries, to monitor and control IUU fishing activities. In an effort to settle the European Union’s concern that Seoul has been ineffective in deterring IUU fishing activities by Korean vessels in West African waters, the Korean government imposed administrative sanctions against 22 Korean vessels based on reports from the European Union and the Environmental Justice Foundation. Based on the “three-strike” rule, the owners of the sanctioned vessels would lose their fishing licenses if violations occured twice more. All these changes have been a good example of controlling IUU fishing activities through cooperative governance between a fishing nation, a coastal state and an NGO. We believe that the measures will help eliminate IUU fishing in the waters of West Africa. It seems that nearly all of the European Union’s recommendations on prevention, deterrence and elimination of IUU fishing have been accomplished. I believe this reflects the country’s genuine commitment to the fight against IUU fishing. I hope South Korea and the European Union can build a strong partnership to put an end to IUU fishing, and work together on improving relevant international fisheries norms.

[Band Uprising] Ten travel enthusiasts take globe-trotting to new level,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3639992,2014.06.01 20:05,"The Tourist releases 2nd full album, ‘Guidebook to Excitement’ As the Korean music market begins to receive more international recognition, the local band scene is looking to rise up and represent the next generation of Korean music. This is the 14th installment of a series of interviews with Korean rock, acoustic and alternative bands. ― Ed. What initially started out as a band of four musically inclined travel-lovers unexpectedly transformed into the now, 10-member local indie band “The Tourist.” Meeting a majority of their newest members online via social networking sites, the band is a unique collaboration of vocalists, musicians, an engineer, travel photographer, music video director and even an illustrator. The group also includes a number of composers ― two of whom used to write music for popular K-pop acts TVXQ and IU. “We are all just people who love to travel,” said producer Kim Dal-woo during an interview with some of his bandmates at the Sony Music Korea office in Seocho-gu. “Eventually we all got together and decided make music about traveling and that’s how ‘The Tourist’ came to be.” The band’s love of exploring new places, both abroad and locally, is the catalyst behind its music, which needless to say, has to do with the feelings and experiences one may encounter while traveling. The Tourist debuted in April 2012 with its first single “Spring + Romance Part 1” and has since released a steady slew of albums and EPs, including the band’s first eponymous full album in November that same year. The bandmates stated that they strive to release a new single every one to two months and the newly released “Guidebook to Excitement” is the group’s second full studio album. It is comprised of a collection of previously released singles plus one new song. “I think the main differences between our first full album and this second one that we just released is, the first album really focused more on emotion, while our second album really emphasized traveling scenery,” said Kim. The music video for The Tourist’s newest single “Delayed” was filmed while some of the group members were traveling in Macau, China. The basic premise of the song touches upon the notions of delaying love; taking too many detours and missing out on the chance of meeting one’s true love. “Delayed” also marked the group’s fourth music video that the members filmed overseas. The Tourist previously released videos shot throughout Japan including Yokohama, Kyushu and Akita. Aside from the band’s slated theme of travel, one of the main attributes that allows The Tourist to stand out from other local indie bands is the amount of effort and detail that is placed upon every one of the group’s songs. With a professional illustrator, photographer and video director as part of the band, The Tourist presents music that is not only pleasing to the ear, but music that is visually stunning. The band’s physical album is filled with picturesque travel photos, and with every single the members release is also an accompanying music video. “My most memorable travel experience was when I went to Lake Louise in Canada, it’s where I proposed to my wife,” said Kim. “So in memory of this, the music video for the third track on our album was shot with a lakeside background.” All ten members each have their individual role that allows the band to create music to the artistic extent thus far, and continue to strive toward in their future releases. And in the true spirit of traveling, the members state that they never go somewhere for the specific intent of writing a song; rather they enjoy the moments away from home and use the memories and experiences to inspire their music. “The thing with us is, we never write or work on songs while we are traveling around individually,” said vocalist Park Hye-soo. “When we are on our travels, we just simply enjoy the experience.” “I, personally, while I’m traveling may sometimes jot down some of my thoughts and on occasion just use my phone to record various sounds, that way I can listen to them when I come back home and it can transport me back to the same feelings I was having,” said Kim. “But honestly, when you think of the term ‘travel’ in a broader sense, to me it refers to more than just going a distance,” Park added. “Even going someplace nearby your house or in your neighborhood can become a sort of travel experience.” The Tourist will be holding a solo concert at the Seongsu Art Hall in Seongdong-gu from July 25-27.

Eyelike: IU returns with Korean classics,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/119921,2014.05.30 20:47,"Old classics never get old IU “A Flower Bookmark” (LOEN Entertainment) In her new covers album “A Flower Bookmark,” IU leads listeners down memory lane through calm and acoustic reinterpretations of hits from the 80s and 90s. For every track, IU keeps a careful balance between preserving the song’s original sentiments and altering the original with her own color and arrangements. Age does not seem to preclude the 21-year-old singer from reviving old classics released even before she was born. The lead single “My Old Story” is a remake of the 80s singer-songwriter Cho Duk-bae’s original, which portrays a boy reminiscing about a past love. IU sings yearningly as if she is reciprocating the boy’s original message. A mix of piano, strings and accordion imbue the song with an analogue feel. IU’s arrangement of the late Kim Gwang-suk’s “Flower” features a slow classic guitar tune alongside the young singer’s intensely poignant vocals. On the other hand, “Pierrot Laughs At Us” on her album has a lighter, groovier melody that adds a jazzy touch to the original sung by Kim Wan-sun. “The Meaning Of You” is a true mix of the old and the new, as Sanullim’s vocalist Kim Chang-wan, who sang the original, is featured alongside IU. A special narration by Clone is featured in “Boom Ladi Dadi” as well. All in all, IU’s new covers album provides a pleasant, calming respite from the mainstream music of today’s times. (jiyoung.sohn@heraldcorp.com) Mariah Carey an elusive, uneven chanteuse Mariah Carey “Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse” (Def Jam) Mariah Carey’s latest album kicks off in wonderful and typical Mariah form: She sings a song that immediately pulls you in, which has ranged from a killer club jam to a searing slow song in the past. “Cry,” a torching, emotional tune, is the song that does its job on “Me. I Am Mariah ... The Elusive Chanteuse.” You feel like you are about to experience musical bliss, and most of the time Carey has been able to hit it out of the park. But like many veteran all-stars, there comes a time when singers make more errors and can’t score a hit like they used to. Sadly, that is what is happening with Carey. The batch of tracks on her 14th record are enjoyable, but they don‘t have the pizazz and spark of her past albums, including 2009’s “Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel,” her worst-selling album, though musically it was one of the year’s best works. “Elusive Chanteuse” borrows from Carey’s earlier work ― and while the powerful singer still has the vocal chops, her songs find her looking too much to the past. (AP) A winning set by John Fullbright John Fullbright “Songs” (Blue Dirt/Thirty Tigers) The 12 songs on John Fullbright’s “Songs” are so sturdy they need little adornment, and many are performed solo on piano or guitar, which makes them easy to underestimate. That would be a mistake. These songs capture the world through the eyes of a 26-year-old, with all of its complicated contradictions. As such they‘re modest and ambitious, bold and shy, intimate and grand. They’re conversational, confessional and confident, free of frills and full of good advice. As a bonus, one of them rhymes “Fauntleroy” with “La-Z-Boy.” These songs have been performed in coffeehouses and at festivals, on a cruise ship and at the Grammys pre-show, where Fullbright‘s studio debut competed against Mumford & Sons, Bonnie Raitt and others. Their descendants date to the 1970s, when singer-songwriters ruled the pop charts, and also the 1930s, when timeless tunes came from an Oklahoma troubadour named Woody Guthrie.

[Editorial] Disgraceful label,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/111087,2014.05.19 20:21,"Korea shouldn’t remain an illegal fishing country Korea has long been bothered by illegal fishing by Chinese vessels in its seas. The increase in the number of Chinese boats illicitly entering the country’s exclusive economic zone amid the loosening surveillance following the April 16 ferry disaster has further exacerbated public sentiment here. But Koreans have been largely unaware that their nation is also facing mounting international criticism for its involvement in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. The European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, is set to decide on whether to designate Korea an illegal fishing country by the end of next month. In November last year, Korea was placed along with Ghana and Curacao on the list of noncooperating countries pursuant to the commission’s regulations. The final designation, which many experts here see as quite likely, would block exports of fisheries products produced or processed in Korea to EU member states and ban Korean fishing vessels from entering any European port. In January 2013, Korea was one of the 10 nations that U.S. fisheries authorities accused of engaging in IUU fishing. Illegal fishing has in recent years come to be seen as a cause of serious economic and environmental damage on a global scale. Researchers estimate that illegal operations account for about 20 percent of the annual fish haul across the globe. The proportion rises to 40 percent in the sea off the West African coast, where many Korean fishing vessels operate. International efforts to curb IUU fishing continue to be strengthened as the practice mainly affects less-developed coastal countries, which lack effective means to protect their marine resources. Being designated an illegal fishing country by the EU would result in additional losses for Korea’s fisheries industry. But the more serious consequence of the disgraceful status might be significant damage to the image the country has tried to build of a major economic and cultural powerhouse seeking to increase its contributions to the global community. Further international embarrassments may be the last thing Koreans want after their view that the country was close to joining the ranks of advanced nations was shattered by the ferry disaster, in which the ignorance of safety rules and poor rescue work resulted in the loss of more than 300 lives. Though belated, the government has taken the right steps to strengthen regulations on illegal fishing, including enforcing stricter penalties and establishing a surveillance center to monitor operations by all Korean vessels in foreign waters. As some experts here note, there may be some questions that can be raised about the legality of the EU move. But Korea first needs to improve regulatory measures to match international standards in a clear and objective fashion. Then the country might be in a position to make an effective counterargument during international arbitration if the EU goes on to finally confirm its illegal fishing activities.",,iu
IU sweeps charts with covers album,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/108447,2014.05.16 19:59,"Popular singer IU is sweeping the local music charts with her first covers album “A Flower Bookmark,” which was officially unveiled Friday.

Rookies brighten up local charts,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3710741,2014.04.27 20:36,"The K-pop scene has come to a virtual standstill since the April 16 sinking of the ferry Sewol, but two rookie acts are creating some excitement in charts. High4, a four-member boy band, retained the top spot on major digital music charts on Sunday, with its debut single “Not Spring, Love or Cherry Blossoms.” Featuring popular singer IU, the song is a sweet, mid-tempo ballad about loneliness during the blossoming season. As of noon Sunday, it topped Melon, the country’s most popular real-time digital music chart, followed by “200%” by Akdong Musician, another rookie group. On Mnet and other charts, High4 is vying with Akdong Musician for the top spot. The top spot on the Naver chart went to “A Thousand Winds,” a song by pop-opera singer Lim Hyung-joo dedicated to the victims of the ferry disaster. High4, composed of two vocalists (Kim Sun-gu and Baek Myun-han) and two rappers (Yim Young-jun and Alex), is scheduled to release its debut album in May.

Top stars to hold slew of intimate spring concerts,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3643827,2014.04.22 20:28,"As the weather begins to brighten and the promise of greener pastures is just around the corner, a handful of popular artists have organized a series of concerts, moving away from the typical overcrowded, flashy K-pop stage settings. Shin Seung-hoon, IU, Lena Park and other stars will be performing a series of intimate concerts on small stages across the city to usher in the spring. Veteran singer Shin, oftentimes dubbed the “King of Ballads” in Korea, has announced that he will be holding a string of live performances next month at the LG Art Center in Gangnam-gu. The veteran balladeer reentered the limelight as a judge on the TV audition program “Voice of Korea” and released his latest EP “Great Wave” last October, his first album in four years. The upcoming concert series, titled “The Shin Seung-hoon Show ― Limited Edition II,” will be held from May 6-11. Only 1,000 tickets will be sold for each show in order to provide fans with a cozier setting. In preparation for her remake album of past hit singles, K-pop starlet IU is also putting on a series of small concerts this spring. “Fans will be able to meet IU and her colorful music in a fresh, outdoor setting while enjoying the spring breeze,” said the singer’s agency LOEN Tree. “We are preparing a new type of performance where the musician can deliver her sounds more intimately.” The singer will hold a total of eight concerts, titled “Just one more step ... just that,” at Sogang University’s Mary Hall from May 22-June 1. Korean-American ballad singer Lena Park will soon be releasing her newest EP “Syncrofusion” and returning to the stage with a series of live spring shows. Park’s album was originally scheduled to be unveiled last week. However the release date has been pushed back due to the Sewol ferry sinking incident. Although the official release date has not yet been announced, Park is still expected to perform at the Samsung Card Hall at the Blue Square theater in Yongsan-gu starting May 9.

Is Moldova next on Putin’s list of targets?,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3643994,2014.04.21 20:47,"The newly appointed defense minister of Moldova ― the charming but intermittently hapless ex-Soviet Republic stuck between Ukraine and Romania ― is a sturdy-looking ex-prison official named Valeriu Troenco. He seemed, from a slight distance, to be an affable fellow, but he was deeply, dismissively uninterested in answering a question that I asked him after his swearing-in ceremony. The ceremony was held in the presidential offices. While on a trip to Moldova and Ukraine earlier this month, I was invited to witness this stripped-down affair: a line of middle-aged, sagging bureaucrats standing impassively during a set of blessedly brief remarks; a piped-in version of Moldova’s national anthem (in English, more or less, “Gentle Dniester, which in ripples/Carries morning star’s flickers,” etc.); a brief, awkward, bent-knee kiss of the flag and swearing of an oath to defend the nation. That is not an easy thing to promise. It can be safely assumed that Russia, which seems intent on swallowing Ukraine, also has certain designs on Moldova. After a round of Champagne toasts, Troenco was off, but I caught up with him in a hallway. This is the question he didn’t seem to appreciate: “How many troops does Moldova have?” He looked at me for a long moment. “4,000, 5,000.” Two questions quickly sprang to mind, neither of which I asked. The first was, “Which one ― four thousand or five thousand?” It seemed like a substantial difference. The second was, “That’s all?” Instead, I asked Troenco this: “Given the current situation in the region, and given that Russia already has two thousand troops in Transnistria” ― a breakaway Leninist rump state on the far side of the Dniester River whose independence is only recognized by three other breakaway Russia-centric faux states ― “are you actually equipped to defend your country?” He answered: “We are going to get ready. That’s my job ― to get ready.” Then he hustled away, presumably to get ready. Later that afternoon, I went to the main government building, on the central square of Chisinau (the city better known in Russian as Kishinev). The seat of government is an immense Soviet-era structure of drafty, high-ceilinged offices and endless hallways that seem to be straight out of “The Shining.” I went there to ask the prime minister, Iurie Leanca, about the same topic: Are you ready for what may be coming? “Honestly, what we don’t count on is to be ready to resist militarily some outside intervention,” he said. “Look at the Ukrainian example. The Ukrainian army is much bigger than the Moldovan one. It’s not a feasible solution. What we count on is a de-escalation of the situation, to hope that everyone, especially in the east, understands that this tension isn’t good for anyone. So I hope that this” ― Russia’s slow-motion dismantling of Ukraine ― “is just a one-time episode.” Does he actually believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin will stop at Ukraine? He demurred. He knows he walks a knife’s edge ― every word he utters is studied carefully in Moscow. But he went on to take note of a troubling trend: a pronounced increase in the tempo of Russian troop “exercises” in Transnistria, which sits just an hour away from Chisinau. Transnistria, which has a population of roughly 500,000 (no one knows for sure, and the Transnistrian government, which is suspected of being controlled by the Kremlin, is uninterested in authorizing a rigorous census), maintains its own army and police detachments, which receive aid and support from Russian troops that never left. “The Russian army is trying to learn how to cross the Dniester River in a few minutes,” the prime minister told me. Even though he refuses to speculate about Putin’s designs, I suspect Leanca understands that Moldova is facing an existential crisis. I suspect he believes that Putin has designs on Moldova because most everyone in Moldova ― even the leaders of the Communist Party (it is still, rather unbelievably, called the Communist Party in Chisinau) ― believes that Putin sees it as part of Russia’s birthright. The Communists naturally believe that this is a legitimate feeling on Putin’s part and so would like to lead Moldova back into Moscow’s orbit. The prime minister heads a pro-Western coalition facing a difficult election this fall. If he ― and the European Union and Washington ― pay insufficient attention, Moldova will find itself in Putin’s column. The consequences will be disastrous not only for Moldova, but also for the future of democracy in Europe. “Some people say that there is an opportunity in any crisis, so this crisis is, of course, bad for us, our feelings and sentiments, but there is a positive aspect to this,” the prime minister said. “One basic problem we have, the same as Ukraine, is that we are in a gray neighborhood,“ unlike Romania, which, after the collapse of the Communist bloc, joined NATO. ”We need to have answers now not just for Crimea or Transnistria. The immediate response to our problems is for the EU and the U.S. to come forward with a vision to integrate Moldova into the EU. It means supporting Moldova more.” The U.S., which has only recently woken to the threat facing Ukraine, has been even slower to appreciate Moldova’s equally precarious position. Barack Obama‘s administration is moving now to bring Moldova into the Western fold. The EU is, in tentative and not entirely confidence-building ways, also trying to signal to Putin that Moldova is not his for the taking. After a week in Moldova and western Ukraine ― more posts on that coming soon ― it seemed unlikely to me that Putin had internalized the message.

IU to return with first remake album,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3643092,2014.04.10 20:22,"Popular singer-songwriter IU will make a return next month with her first remake album and a series of concerts. The album will be her first remake since her debut in 2008. It will feature reinterpretations and rearrangements of past hits through IU’s signature vocals and musical sensibilities. The singer-songwriter will also stage a series of concerts, titled “Just one more step ... just that,” at Sogang University’s Mary Hall. Unlike IU’s previous concert last year, which was marked by a flashy stage design and visuals, the upcoming concerts will focus on communicating with the audience in a more intimate setting. “Fans will be able to meet IU and her colorful music in a fresh, outdoor setting while enjoying the spring breeze,” said the singer’s agency LOEN Tree. “We are preparing a new type of performance where the musician’s sounds can be delivered more intimately.” IU debuted on the local music scene at the age of 15 and shot to stardom with her resonating vocals and distinct tones, producing many hits including “You and I,” “Nagging,” “Good Day,” “Boo” and “Someday.” She released her third studio album, “Modern Times,” in October 2013. The jazzy lead single “Red Shoes” and several other tracks from the album swept major music charts in Korea. IU’s self-written single “Friday” also enjoyed high popularity upon its release in December last year, while her latest composition, “Not Spring, Love or Cherry Blossoms,” a duet with rookie boy band High4, tops local real-time music charts. IU will perform eight live concerts at Mary Hall from May 22-June 1. Ticket sales will begin at 8 p.m. on April 17 through Interpark.

Scientists analyze genome of vulture for first time,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3697387,2014.03.31 21:05,"Korea scientists successfully analyzed the genome of the cinereous vulture, a large bird of prey found across Europe and Asia, for the first time, the Science Ministry said Monday. The findings are expected to offer clues on the genetic structure of the bird, scientifically known as Aegypius monachus, such as why it does not contract diseases from eating rotten meat. Scientists took blood samples from two live vultures and performed an analysis of the first whole genome and transcriptome of the birds by using Next Generation Sequencing ― a type of DNA decoder ― and bioinformatics technology. Bioinformatics involves using a computer to analyze and process huge amounts of biological data. Through five-month-long genome sequencing, researchers identified 200,000 unigenes, genome fragments that each has unique characteristics. They said these are “candidates” that could be identified as genes with further analysis. Scientists found that the bird’s genes related to immunity and gastric acid secretion were unusual compared to other animals. This can explain why the bird, both a hunter and a scavenger, is not affected by pathogenic bacteria after ingesting decayed meat. They also found that vultures became genetically separate from falcons about 80 million years ago. According to the researchers, the bird carries out a crucial ecological role by eating animal carcass. This prevents the bacteria from the dead bodies from infecting other animals or humans. But vulture populations have been decreasing due to the diminishing number of dead livestock, coupled with the increase in poisonous chemical substances that have been released into the wild. Researches said there have not been enough studies on the ecological role and biological uniqueness of the birds. “Genome analysis of the vulture will provide ground-breaking information toward research of the bird,” said project leader Paek Woo-ki of the National Science Museum, saying the study will be a milestone in efforts to preserve the vultures. The cinereous vulture is categorized as “near threatened,” according to “The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. In Korea, it is considered an endangered animal and is designated as a national monument. The research was conducted by the National Science Museum, the Cultural Heritage Administration, Theragenetex Bio Institute and the Korean Bioinformation Center of the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology.

[Lee Jae-min] Korea and illegal fishing,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/28203,2013.12.25 19:59,"The European Union’s preliminary designation of Korea as a country failing to meet its international obligation to fight illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is an embarrassing development. Although at this time this is meant to be a warning signal only from the EU to push Korea to take remedial action as quickly as possible, it is also probable that the warning turns into an official designation in the future, which may lead to the import ban by the EU of the fisheries products from Korea. Given the global stigma associated with IUU fishing, the EU’s recent designation of Korea as such raises a flag that a serious action needs to be taken domestically. This is yet another dent to the image of the country, after the United States’ similar designation of Korea in January this year. With “yellow cards” from the two major countries, Korea’s position in the international forums discussing this issue will become more precarious: Combating IUU has been one of the top priorities of the international community for the past decade, spearheaded by FAO and relevant NGOs. As previously noted in this column after the U.S. designation, the IUU fishing has been criticized by the world community for a long time because of its devastating effect on global fish stocks. It is indeed alarming that both countries, in the same year, have designated Korea as an IUU-prone country. Korea hurriedly amended its law (Ocean Industries Development Act) in July as a preemptive measure against a likely EU designation, but it apparently did not work. The core criticism from the EU is that Korea has not fulfilled the international obligation to require its vessels to install a device called a vessel monitoring system, which tracks the location and activity of vessels engaging in fishing activities in the high seas. The amendment becomes effective as of Jan. 31, but the mandatory installment of the VMS has been deferred until July 30, 2014. Reportedly, this deferral has been the main reason that prompted the EU’s inclusion of Korea on the IUU country list. Korea’s slow implementation of VMS requirements is indeed noteworthy considering the intensity of international attention to this very matter. The nature of the equipment being discussed makes the slow implementation more perplexing. VMS is a readily available electronic tracking device costing $3,000 to $5,000 per ship. Foreign observers who know Korea as a country saturated and obsessed with information technology would find it puzzling that the country is dragging its feet in installing this particular type of maritime electronic device. Korea’s slow implementation of this simple requirement can hardly find good excuses. The IUU activity is a global problem. It is taking place in many countries ― that is why a global undertaking is called for in the first place. Questions are thus being raised if “singling out” Korea has been somehow motivated by an ulterior motive. Competition is intense between Korean vessels and European fishermen in seas off West Africa, where illegal fishing poses a peculiar problem because of its massive scale. Critics argue that the EU’s specific interest as well as an environmental concern may have been reflected in blacklisting Korea. In any event, just how much emphasis some countries put on this particular issue when they deal with Korea is evidenced by the report that the United States is going to raise fishery subsidies ― of which IUU is the core component ― as one of the key outstanding issues to be discussed with Korea in advance in the context of Korea’s participation in the TPP negotiations. To Korea, then, addressing this issue almost becomes a membership fee for the mega-FTA. This means that this issue will stay with us next year and perhaps for many more years. As many of us know, the best way to save Korea from any further embarrassment and to avoid other countries’ using this as a card against Korea is to implement these international obligations as promptly as possible. Korea is already paying a high price.

African elephant survival tops agenda at Botswana talks,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/26449,2013.12.02 20:06,"JOHANNESBURG (AFP) ― African ministers and experts are meeting this week in Botswana to chart ways to stamp out a spike in elephant killings fuelled by a growing demand for ivory in Asia. “Poaching of elephants and associated ivory trafficking remain of grave concern,” said Richard Thomas, spokesman for the animal conservation group Traffic. The three-day meeting that opened on Monday in Gaborone has been organized by the Botswana government and the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Poaching has risen sharply in Africa in recent years and the illegal ivory trade has tripled since 1998, according to the United Nations Environment Program. Large-scale seizures of ivory destined for Asia have more than doubled since 2009 and reached an all-time high in 2011. The meeting expects to adopt a pact that will commit signatories, including the biggest ivory markets, such as China, to demonstrate political will at the highest level in the fight against poaching and ivory trafficking. IUCN said increasing poaching levels and loss of habitat are threatening the survival of elephants in central Africa as well as in previously secure havens in west, southern and east Africa. There are less than half a million elephants left in Africa compared with 1.2 million in 1980 and 10 million in 1900. Poachers are becoming more sophisticated, using helicopters and automatic weapons as the price of ivory on the black market shot up tenfold in the past decade to more than $2,000 per kilogram. The tusk of an adult 30-year-old elephant can weigh around 20 kilograms, according to experts. “The situation is dramatic,” said Stephanie Vergniault, who founded the charity SOS Elephants in Chad. She warns that “in 10 years there will be no African elephants.” Most of the ivory ends up in the Middle East and Asia, particularly in Thailand and China. Beyond worries of the species‘ survival, elephant poaching has given rise to security and terrorism concerns. Proceeds from ivory are believed to be financing groups such as Somalia’s Al-Qaeda linked Shebab, Uganda‘s Lord’s Resistance Army and Sudan‘s Janjaweed militia, according to conservation charities. The Gaborone meeting is a follow-up to the Bangkok talks held in March under the aegis of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora at which eight countries were accused of failing to do enough to tackle ivory trafficking. Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda as well as transit countries Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, and top markets China and Thailand were identified as making insufficient efforts to curb the trade. The next CITES meeting takes place in July and will “decide whether the eight countries are to face disciplinary measures,” said IUCN’s global species specialist Lynne Labanne. All countries have to undertake to work together to curb the slaughter of elephants because “one country cannot fight trafficking alone”, and penalties must be toughened, said Maine Sebogo, head of the global conservation group WWF in Botswana. “We must go beyond speeches and move on to take concrete action,” said Congolese Minister of Forestry Henri Djombo. There is also a need to take urgent action to protect the elephants in previously safe zones of eastern and southern African countries. Hundreds of elephants were this year poisoned in Zimbabwe for their tusks. South Africa, which is already buckling under an unprecedented wave of rhino poaching, has so far been spared of elephant killings, but it is worried. “Ivory poaching is now a reality in countries north of our border, including northern Mozambique,” said General Johan Jooste, who heads the anti-poaching task team at South Africa‘s famous Kruger National Park. “We are hoping to use the expertise we have gained in fighting rhino poaching to confront ivory poachers,” he said. Ivory trade is banned under the CITES. The illegal ivory trade is estimated to be worth up to $10 billion a year. Elephant tusks are used to make ornaments and rhinoceros horns are used in traditional medicine.",,iu
S. Korea displeased with illegal fishing nation designation by EU,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/25708,2013.11.26 22:06,"South Korea on Tuesday expressed its displeasure with the European Union's preliminary designation of the country as an illegal fishing nation, noting it has already revised law to intensify fishing regulation set to go into effect early next year, according to a ministry official. ""South Korea has consistently sought to react to various issues raised by the European Union since last year, and the result of such efforts was the revision to the law on deep-sea fishing, which was legislated in late July,"" an official from the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries told reporters. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the EU's preliminary designation of the country as an IUU (illegal, unreported and unregulated) fishing country Tuesday came despite EU's awareness that the country's ""necessary regulations (to curb IUU fishing) are now in place and ready to go into effect early next year."" Under the revised law on deep-sea fishing, all South Korean vessels engaged in overseas fishing must be equipped with a tracking device known as vessel monitoring system starting in July 30 after a six-month probation period following the enactment of the revised law on Jan. 31, 2014. The country will also set up a fishing monitoring center to keep a close watch on all overseas fishing by South Korean ships, a key issue raised earlier by the EU, according to ministry officials. Another issue raised by the EU had been South Korea's penalty against IUU fishing, which currently is a fine of less than 5 million won ($4,717). Starting Jan. 31, the maximum fine for IUU fishing will be raised to three times the value of the catch from illegal fishing. For now, EU's preliminary designation will have little impact on the country's fishing activities, let alone its exports of fishery products to EU member states, which amounted to $107.6 million in 2012, the ministry officials said. EU regulations only stipulate that countries preliminarily designated IUU fishing nation must work with the EU to avoid official designation. The ministry officials said the country's new and strengthened measures against illegal fishing that are set to go into effect next year should be enough to meet all EU criteria to have the country taken off the short list for official IUU designation.

Annual MAMA promises another star-studded night,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/25515,2013.11.20 20:02,"Legendary music icon Stevie Wonder, internationally recognized music acts Ylvis of Norway and Icona Pop from Sweden, and Hollywood celebrity starlet Paris Hilton are all on the guest list for the upcoming fifth annual Mnet Asia Music Awards in Hong Kong on Friday. One of the most anticipated awards ceremonies in Asia, MAMA attracts some of the top names in the K-pop and Korean entertainment industry; however, officials at CJ E&M have stated that it is continuing its attempts to turn the awards ceremony into a more internationally recognized event. “As Stevie Wonder’s appearance this year demonstrates, 2013 MAMA is much more than a simple music awards show, but a true festival uniting Asia through music and culture, and promoting a message of hope throughout the world,” said Mnet production director Shin Hyung-kwan in a press release. The awards show recognizes the year’s most popular music acts and gives fans the opportunity to vote for their favorite nominated artists. Some of this year’s nominees include G-Dragon, Psy, Cho Yong-pil, Lee Seung-ki and Lee Seung-chul battling it out for male artist of the year. Meanwhile, Baek Ji-young, Sunmi of Wonder Girls, IU, Ailee and Lee Hyori are contending for the title of this year’s best female artist. Other nominees of the night include 2NE1, Girls’ Generation, Sistar, 4minute, f(x), EXO, SHINee, Shinhwa, Infinite, Lee Hi and Crayon Pop. Since the worldwide online fan voting period opened on Oct. 24, more than 10 million people in 191 countries have cast votes for their favorite Korean artists, according to an Mnet official. Chinese fans accounted for nearly half of the votes at 48 percent (approximately 4.5 million votes), followed by Korea at 13.5 percent, Taiwan at 6.8 percent, Malaysia at 5 percent and Thailand and the United States at 3.8 and 3.7 percent, respectively. “The number of participants in the online voting confirms the interest and anticipation of MAMA,” said Shin. “We hope to put on fun performances audiences around the world can enjoy.” The 2013 Mnet Asia Music Awards will take place on Nov. 22 at the Hong Kong Asian Expo Arena and air in more than 93 countries across Asia, Europe, North America, Africa and Oceania.

IU’s star continues to rise,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/25224,2013.11.19 19:21,"Singer-actress cements leading lady status with new TV drama Singer IU is returning to the small screen hot on the heels of the release of her chart-topping third full length album, “Modern Times.” As she sets to crown her new album’s launch with a concert this week, IU is also taking the next step to leaving her days as a supporting actress behind with a lead in KBS’ “Bel Ami.” In two years, IU has managed to leap from her endearing first supporting role as a dorky singing ingenue in KBS’ “Dream High” to leading lady status, first as the plucky heroine in the weekend drama “You Are the Best!” and now as the self-described “quirky” and “playful” Bo-tong in the upcoming “Bel Ami.” Some might question her decision to tackle a second heroine while still supporting her album. IU, however, said, “I felt I could do both.” “I was into the second week of activities for my new album when I received the synopsis, and it was great fun to read,” the 20-year-old singer-actress explained as to why she could not turn down the opportunity despite its overlap with her singing schedule. IU’s latest role, which she describes as a mash-up of her “Dream High” character and her “You’re the Best!” heroine, is a left-of-center, near-geek girl who pines for a handsome ladies’ man-in-the-making, played by hallyu star Jang Keun-suk. In the drama ― which is based on a comic book series ― Jang’s hero, Dokgo Mate, makes his way up the social ladder with the aid of 10 well-heeled women who are enamored with his striking good looks and charm. One can only guess that as he dates a string of wealthy socialites, Dokgo will eventually see the true swan in Bo-tong’s ugly duckling. Jang, himself, already sees the real thespian in IU. “She is like a veteran actress who has been honing her craft for years,” Jang, 26, said of working with her at the drama’s press conference on Monday. Since IU made her debut in 2008, she has proven herself well-steeled for all the fame and success that has come her way, displaying an even-keeled ability to intercept most any question with earnest, sometimes unexpected, answers. At the press event, IU answered questions regarding what kind of men she finds charming with ease, saying, “A man of many talents, and I do not mean someone who can carve out a lucrative career for himself, per se.” After a pause, she added, out of left field, “Like a guy who is exceptionally gifted at playing a short bamboo flute?” Amidst all the fun and laughter, IU shed some light on how she has kept it together throughout her rise to stardom. “After debuting I think it was smart to use a stage name,” said IU. “I can separate my personal from my public life.” The starlet, who turned 20 this year, elaborated that as IU, she has grown wiser and increasingly thoughtful about her work life. Conversely, as Lee Ji-eun, IU said she has been able to increasingly simplify her private life, dwell less on matters and stay true to her emotions and her personal relationships. “I think that is good,” she said. “Bel Ami” starts airing Nov. 20 Wednesday and Thursday nights on KBS 2 TV at 10 p.m. By Jean Oh ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2013/11/19/20131119001258_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

"잇따른 표절 논란, 한국가요계 위기",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/24695,2013.11.12 15:07,"최근 힙합 뮤지션 프라이머리를 비롯한 국내 가수들이 잇따른 표절 의혹에 휩싸이면서 한국 가요계가 과거부터 지금까지 끊이지 않는 표절 논란에 곤욕을 치르고 있다. 많은 이들은 이러한 표절 논란이 향후 국내 가요계에 어떤 영향을 미칠지에 대해 의문을 제기하고 있다. 프라이머리와 방송인 박명수가 팀을 이뤄 최근 방송된 MBC 무한도전의 자유로 가요제 참가곡으로 선보인 ‘아이갓씨(I Got C)’는 국내 음원차트 1위를 휩쓸었다. 하지만 얼마 지나지 않아 네티즌들은 프라이머리의 ‘아이갓씨’가 프로듀서 데이비드 슈울러스가 작곡한 네덜란드 가수 카로 에메랄드의 ‘리퀴드 런치(Liquid Lunch)’와 눈에 띄게 유사하다는 점을 지적했다. 과거 케이팝 그룹 빅뱅의 리더 지드래곤과 솔로 디바 이효리 등의 경우에서도 볼수 있듯이 이러한 표절 시비는 한국 가요계에선 낯설지 않은 광경이다. 프라이머리는 이로써 올해 가요계를 강타한 가수 아이유, 로이킴과 함께 표절 의혹 리스트에 올랐다. 네티즌은 아이유의 정규 3집 앨범 ‘모던타임스’ 타이틀 곡 ‘분홍신’이 독일그룹 넥타의 ‘히얼즈 어스(Here’s Us)’와 매우 흡사하다며 표절을 의심한 바 있다. 두 곡의 유사성을 보여주는 비교 동영상이 네티즌들에 의해 유트브에 게재되기도 했다. 엠넷 ‘슈퍼스타K 4’ 우승자인 가수 로이 킴의 ‘봄봄봄’ 또한 인디 뮤지션 ‘어쿠스틱 레인’의 데뷔 싱글 ‘러브 이즈 캐논(Love is Canon)’의 우크렐레 버젼과 유사하다는 이유로 표절 시비에 휘말렸다. 로이킴이 표절 논란에 휩싸이자 CJ E&M 측은 표절을 당한 건 로이킴이라며 반박했다. 실제로 표절 시비가 불거진 우크렐레 버젼은 로이킴의 ‘봄봄봄’ 발표 후 약 한달 뒤에 한국저작권위원회에 등록된 것으로 알려졌다. 국내 가수들의 표절 논란이 잇따르자 샘플링의 의미와 샘플링과 표절의 차이점이 이슈가 되고 있다. 이에 대해 AMP 미디어의 프로듀서 브라이언 박은 “샘플링은 곡 발표 이전에 원곡의 가수로부터 허가를 받는 것”이라고 설명했다. 그는 “표절이란 상대의 곡을 베껴 다른 이들이 알아차리지 못할 것을 바라는 거나, 또는 눈치채지 못하도록 곡을 변형하는 것이다. 반면 샘플링은 애초에 원곡의 아티스트에게 허가를 받는 것이다“라고 두 단어 사이의 차이를 명확히 했다. (임우정 인턴기자 / 코리아헤럴드) <관련영문기사> Netizens cracking down on plagiarism scandals plaguing K-pop world The recent charges of plagiarism involving local hip-hop artist Primary has brought the Korean music industry’s notorious past and ongoing allegations of plagiarism to the fore. Many are now questioning how these accusations will impact the future of the industry. Thanks to the infinite capabilities of the Internet, netizens have been exposing supposed plagiarism. “As bad as an accusation of plagiarism can be, the resolution of plagiarism in Korea might actually be far worse,” said one industry insider. “A false claim can seriously damage a person‘s career while a true claim can be very difficult to collect any sort of financial damages for.” The single “I Got C” was produced by Primary along with comedian Park Myung-soo for the newly released album “Jayuro Music Festival” by the members of popular MBC variety program “Infinite Challenge.” The single became a big hit, topping the local real time music charts. However, soon after the song’s release, netizens revealed that Primary’s track, along with several other tracks previously produced by the artist, bore striking resemblances to songs produced by David Schreurs. Schreurs produced Dutch singer Caro Emerald’s “Liquid Lunch,” from which the Korean hip-hop artist is accused of lifting the melody. “These days, there are more and more overseas producers, composers and songwriters expressing interest working with Korean music artists,” said the industry insider. “Although such international collaborations are becoming more commonplace in the industry, any time a high profile plagiarism case emerges, it never looks good.” The K-pop industry is no stranger to copyright infringement allegations, with some of the most notorious cases involving some of the nation’s biggest acts, including Big Bang leader G-Dragon and solo diva Lee Hyori. This year alone Primary is merely joining a list of other stars such as IU and Roy Kim, whom netizens have accused of having tracks that sound far too similar to other artists’ work. Netizens have raised plagiarism allegations against K-pop star IU’s lead track “The Red Shoes” from her recently released third studio album “Modern Times.” They claim the track sounds strikingly similar to German duo Nekta’s “Here’s Us,” an electro-jazz pop track released in 2009. Some netizens went as far as to compile a YouTube comparison clip of the two songs played back to back, with others even overlapping the tracks so listeners could hear them simultaneously, highlighting the similarities. Earlier this year Superstar K4 winner Roy Kim also found himself swept in a sea of plagiarism controversy surrounding his debut single “Spring Spring Spring,” which spent three weeks at the top of the Billboard K-Pop Hot 100. Online communities began posting comments after the single was released in April, accusing Kim of plagiarizing indie singer Acoustic Rain’s ukulele version of the song “Love is Canon.” After the news came to light, representatives of CJ E&M made a counter claim stating that it was Kim, in fact, whose work was being plagiarized. It was later revealed that the version of “Love is Canon” was in fact registered with the Korea Copyright Commission nearly one month after Kim’s “Spring Spring Spring” was released. There is also the issue of sampling, a common practice in hip-hop music, and how it differs from plagiarism. “When you sample something, you’re giving credit and getting permission from the original artist before the song is released,” said producer Bryan Park with company AMP Media. “Plagiarism is copying someone’s song and hoping no one notices or changing the song so that no one will notice. Sampling is, from the beginning, giving credit to the original artist and getting permission. It’s all about credit and permission.” By Julie Jackson ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2013/11/12/20131112001106_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

Park Ji-yoon’s ‘Mr. Lee’ conquers music charts,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/22941,2013.10.22 18:58,"Veteran singer Park Ji-yoon’s newly released “Mr. Lee” has pushed aside tracks by IU and Busker Busker to rank No. 1 on eight major music charts including Olleh, Daum, Bugs and Naver. The track ranked No. 2 on Melon and Cyworld. “Mr. Lee” is a track off the EP “Mr.” which was released online Monday. Park also held a showcase commemorating her comeback on Monday where she performed her song for the first time. The track was composed by hip-hop artist Primary and features rapper San E. Considering the track beat hit songs by Busker Busker, IU and K.will in the charts, this marks a good start to the singer’s new beginning at Yoon Jong-shin’s agency Mystic 89, which she joined earlier this year.

Eyelike: IU impresses on ‘Modern Times’,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/23035,2013.10.18 20:03,"IU impresses on ‘Modern Times’ IU “Modern Times” (LOEN Entertainment) IU, known for her “younger sister” image and songs, has shed her cutesy pop cocoon for a more mature look and sound. “Modern Times” has a total of 13 tracks with genres that range from pop, folk, jazz and swing to bossa nova and Latin. Title track “The Red Shoes” showcases IU’s vocals in a cabaret-style setting, complete with blaring horns and lively percussion. Like many of the tracks on the album, vintage sounds and modern effects are put together artfully, forming a fresh but familiar compilation of songs. “Modern Times” has a distinct carefree feel that is reminiscent of jazz during the Roaring Twenties. “Everyone has Secrets” features Brown Eyed Girls member Ga-in and is a bossa nova number that mixes the two singers’ voices well. “Walk with Me, Girl” features veteran singer Choi Baek-ho and provides an interesting traditional Korean-sounding vocal into the mix. “A Gloomy Clock” features SHINee’s Jong-hyun and is one of the most modern-sounding tracks in the whole album. The track provides listeners with an interesting array of bubbling, ticking, whistling and xylophone sounds, making for a playful song. By Cha Yo-rim (yorimcha@heraldcorp.com) Miley Cyrus‘s new album shows promise Miley Cyrus, “Bangerz” (RCA) Cyrus’ “Bangerz,” her fourth album, is a collection that marks the 20-year-old‘s musical breakthrough. The former “Hannah Montana” star kicks off the 13-track set with “Adore You,” a downbeat song about love. Other tracks that follow with that energy -- “Wrecking Ball,” “My Darlin” and “Somewhere Else” -- capture a more mature, nuanced side of Cyrus that we haven’t seen much of -- and that‘s a welcome change. When she explores the different emotions of her character and doesn’t play the caricature that she‘s become, you’re able to appreciate Cyrus as an artist. The Britney Spears-assisted “SMS (Bangerz)” and the Pharrell-produced “(hash)GETITRIGHT” are addictive, feel-good, up-tempo pop tunes; “FU” -- guess what it stands for -- has Cyrus semi-angry over a dramatic beat, and it makes for an overall punchy and amazing track; and “4x4,” featuring Nelly, is a pop-twang adventure. Even “Do My Thang” -- where Cyrus isn‘t too convincing as a rapper -- sounds good thanks to the groovy hook that she sings, and will.i.am’s Southern hip-hop-flavored beat. (AP) McCartney stays fresh, familiar on ‘New’ Paul McCartney “New” (Hear Music) For his 16th solo record, and first of original material in six years, Paul McCartney turned to a team of four hot producers to come up with something “New.” The result is both fresh and comfortably familiar. McCartney, a master of the catchy three-minute pop song, isn‘t reinventing himself here as the title may suggest. Just try listening to “On My Way to Work” or “Queenie Eye” without bobbing your head along to the beat. Really, love him or hate him, few can pump out these types of ditties quite like McCartney. Still, he’s no Bob Dylan. There are flirtations with material with some gravitas here, but it‘s just that -- a flirtation. Much of the credit for the success of “New” goes to McCartney’s four producers -- especially Paul Epworth (Adele) and Mark Ronson (Amy Winehouse). The other two, Giles Martin and Ethan Johns, are the sons of famous Beatles producers George Martin and Glyn Johns. While the multi-producer approach could have resulted in a hot mess, the end result is surprisingly cohesive, modern-sounding and, most of all, fun to listen to.

"Reporter, blogger arrested for spreading false rumors online",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/22470,2013.10.14 22:03,"A local daily reporter and a blogger were arrested for spreading false rumors about a TV announcer's personal life, prosecution officials said Monday, in yet another case of online libel leading to criminal charges. The Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office said the two face defamation charges for their online postings. They had claimed that Hwang Soo-gyeong, an announcer with state-run broadcaster KBS, was caught having an affair, and that her prosecutor husband was going to divorce her. The couple had sought an official investigation on the source of the rumors in order to press charges. They filed a separate petition for compensation and correction from cable channel TV Chosun for reporting the rumors as factual news. In May, Singer IU and her agency had pursued criminal punishment against internet rumormongers who said she was about to get married. The parties reached a settlement last month on the condition that the man who started the rumors serve 200 hours of community service. (Yonhap News)",,iu
NGO accuses Korean vessel of ‘pirate’ fishing in West Africa,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/22497,2013.10.10 20:00,"An international environmental group accused a Korean trawler of illegal fishing in waters off West Africa. The Environmental Justice Foundation, a London-headquartered nongovernmental organization, told The Korea Herald that the Kum Woong 101 ship has sent to Busan its catch from illegal, unreported and unregulated operations within Sierra Leone’s Inshore Exclusion Zone on Sept. 18-19. It cited satellite images and its positioning system. Busan-based Kum Woong Fisheries Co., the owner of the ship denied the claim. It said the 85 tons of fish were caught and handed over in waters off Guinea Bissau with a legitimate license. But as its captain and chief engineer became ill, Kum Woong 101 had to enter the Freetown port in Sierra Leone where better medical services were available. The EJF said the 470-ton trawler sailed on Sept. 20 to Guinea’s Exclusive Economic Zone and passed its shipment onto a Dutch cargo boat named Holland Klipper in breach of the African country’s regulations. The ship’s captain has confirmed to the U.K.-headquartered organization by satellite phone that 4,385 cartons had been transshipped from the Korean ship, which is forecast to arrive at Busan in about three weeks. “The catch was the product of our work over the past six months in Guinea Bissau ― not Sierra Leone ― we usually get 3-4 tons a day at best,” managing director Chun Hyo-yul said. “But we’ve paid a fine of $70,000 for violating local fisheries law such as arbitrarily entering the port and operating in Sierra Leone’s IEZ. The boat is currently operating in Sierra Leone since we’ve acquired a license there in the meantime.” After local authorities and the EJF’s complaints, the firm is to submit explanatory materials to the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries as early as Friday. The ministry said it has also requested related information from the governments of Sierra Leone, Guinea and the Netherlands through diplomatic channels. “We’re looking into the case and plan to take appropriate measures depending on the results,” a ministry official said. The West African coast has seen massive foreign trawlers sweep up hundreds of tons of fish a day and export their illicit catch to Europe and Asia at the expense of local fishermen with much smaller boats. Even with a license, the trawlers are supposed to stay outside a 12-mile limit but come closer at night, taking advantage of the poor countries’ lack of resources to monitor or police their waters. A series of Korean vessels have been identified fishing illegally in West African waters in recent years, prompting international criticism and government action. In its 2013 report to Congress, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce designated Korea as one of 10 countries engaged in IUU fishing activities along with Colombia, Ghana, Tanzania and Venezuela. The African Development Bank said last year that the continent lost 1 million tons of fish every year due to overfishing and bad governance in the fisheries sector, which accounts for 10 percent of global losses. If properly managed, fisheries can provide more jobs and more income, and feed up to 20 million malnourished people in the developing world, it said. “IUU fishing vessels undermine marine ecosystems, fish stocks and are responsible for high mortality of species including turtles and sharks,” the EJF said in a statement. “This is a key time because Korea has recently been under pressure as a result of the illegal activities of its fleet and there are suggestions that Korea could face trade sanctions from the European Union for its role in illegal fishing in West Africa and beyond, if improvements aren’t made.” By Shin Hyon-hee ()",,iu

한국 원양어선 서아프리카 불법 조업 논란 재점화,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/22275,2013.10.10 17:26,"영국의 한 국제환경단체가 한국 원양어선이 지난 9월 아프리카 연안에서 불법조업을 하고 수산자원을 남획했다고 주장해 또 다시 논란이 일고 있다. 런던에 본부를 둔 NGO인 환경정의재단은 위성 사진과 자동위치추적시스템을 근거로 부산 소재 원양업체인 금웅수산의 ‘금웅101호’가 지난 9월 18-19일 시에라리온 연안에서 허가 없이 조업을 했다고 코리아헤럴드에 밝혔다. 포획물은 다음날 기니의 배타적경제수역(EEZ) 내에서 ‘홀란드 클리퍼’라는 네덜란드 냉동화물선으로 환적되었고 3주 후 부산항에 도착할 것이라고 이 단체는 주장했다. 금웅수산은 불법행위 주장을 부인하고 있다. 이 업체의 천효열 상무는 코리아헤럴드와의 전화 통화에서 “그 85톤의 고기는 적법한 허가를 받아 지난 6개월 동안 기니비소에서 수확 및 환적한 것”이라고 밝혔다. 그는 “다만 선장과 기관장이 건강이 급격히 악화되어 비교적 의료시설이 잘 되어 있는 시에라리온의 프리타운항에 임의적으로 입항할 수밖에 없었다”고 해명했다. 또한 “무허가 입항, 어업관리 및 IEZ조업불가 등 수산업 위반 명목으로 7만 불의 벌금을 물고 그 사이에 조업권을 획득하여 ‘금웅101호’은 현재 시에라리온에서 조업중”이라고 말했다. 금웅수산은 이르면 내일 소명자료를 해양수산부에 제출할 계획이다. 해양수산부 관계자는 현재 “외교채널을 통해 관련자료를 시에라리온, 기니, 네덜란드 정부에 요청한 상태”라면서 “조사 결과가 나오면 그에 따라 적절한 조치를 취할 계획”이라고 덧붙였다. 최근 라이베리아와 시에라리온 등 서부 아프리카 연안에서 한국을 포함한 외국 대형 원양어선들의 불법 조업과 무분별한 남획으로 수산자원이 고갈되어 왔다. 이들 나라에서 수산물은 주요 식량자원이며 생계 수단이다. 조업권을 가진 트롤선들은 원칙적으로 12마일 바깥에 있어야 하지만 주로 감시가 소홀한 야간에 연안으로 진입해 조업한다고 당국과 NGO들은 말한다. 지난해 아프리카개발은행은 불법어업으로 빼앗기는 아프리카의 수산자원이 연간 100만t으로 전 세계 불법어업의 약 10%에 달한다고 발표한 바 있다. 지난 2011년 인성실업의 남극해 이빨고기 불법조업을 계기로 올해 초 미국 상무부가 한국을 10개 IUU(illegal, unreported and unregulated) 어업 국가 중 하나로 지정하면서 국내 업계에서 자성의 목소리가 높아지고 있다. EJF는 “IUU어업은 해양생태계와 어장을 약화시키고 거북이와 상어 같은 종의 높은 개체군 감소의 원인이 된다”고 말했다. 또한 “자국 선박의 불법어업으로 인해 압력을 받아온 한국에게는 지금이 중요한 시기”라며 “만약 개선점이 마련되지 않는다면 한국은 EU로부터 서아프리카의 불법어업으로 인한 무역제재를 받을 수도 있다”고 경고했다.

IU “Modern Times” Twenty-year-old K-pop starlet IU will be shifting gears to a more mature and sophisticated sound and image with her upcoming third full album “Modern Times,” which will drop on Oct. 7. The soon-to-be-released 13-track album (which includes one bonus track) is said to feature songs of a wide variety of genres including swing, folk, bossa nova, Latin pop and more. “Modern Times” also contains two of the singer’s self-composed singles, titled “Voice Mail” and “A Day I Hate.” IU recently released a teaser clip of one of the singles from the new album titled “Between the Lips (50 cm).” The track has a European-style burlesque jazz sound to it, which is a big shift from the young singer’s K-pop roots. T-ara “T-ara’s Effect” Despite the controversy that surrounded the K-pop idol group T-ara over the past year regarding member Hwa-young’s decision to leave the group because she was allegedly bullied by the other members, the remaining members are returning to the scene with the upcoming album “T-ara’s Effect.” Although rumors circulated that newest group member Dani would make her official debut with T-ara through the new album, the group’s agency Core Contents Media announced that this will not happen quite yet and that T-ara will be promoted as a six-member band for the time being. “T-ara’s Effects” is slated to be released on Oct. 10. Nine Muses More than three years since their debut, the ladies of Nine Muses are finally gearing up to release the group’s first full studio album. The yet-to-be-titled album is scheduled to be released sometime next month. The women of Nine Muses made their debut back in 2010 with the track “No Playboy” from the group’s first single “Let’s Have a Party.” Since its debut, the group has released a string of singles but was oftentimes overshadowed by other more popular releases. In January, Nine Muses released its comeback single “Dolls” and landed a spot on the top 10 list of several local real-time charts, marking the group’s first strong release. The girls later released the sexy, electro-pop follow-up single “Wild,” along with the accompanying EP in May. Kim Jae-joong Idol star Kim Jae-joong of the JYJ trio is making his return as a soloist with the announcement that he is planning to release his first solo studio album at the end of October, according to a representative at C-JeS Entertainment. In January, Kim transformed himself into a rocker for the release of his solo debut EP album “I.” The five-track album topped the weekly charts in Korea as well as breaking the record for preorders in Japan. It has been reported that the artist’s first full studio album will be another rock-type album and Kim will be going on tour after its release. Although the star’s agency did not reveal the locations of the tour, it was announced that tour would not be exclusive to Korea.

올 가을 무슨 노래 들을까? 가요계 ‘별들의 전쟁’,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/20620,2013.09.25 17:01,"올 하반기 가요계는 아이돌 그룹부터 베테랑 싱어송라이터들까지 별들의 전쟁이 될 전망이다. 지난해 독특한 어쿠스틱 사운드로 큰 사랑을 받은 버스커버스커는 25일 2집을 발표함과 동시에 주요 음원 사이트 상위권을 휩쓸어 가을의 포문을 열었다. 음반을 낼 때마다 주요 차트 1위를 석권한 아이유는 10월 7일 3집 '모던 타임즈(Modern Times)'를 발표한다. 여타 아이돌 가수들처럼 ‘좋은 날’ , ‘BOO’ 등 대중적인 노래도 소화했지만, 종종 TV 프로그램에 기타를 들고나와 노래를 부르던 아이유는 이번 앨범에 양희은, 최백호 등 세대를 넘나드는 뮤지션을 피처링에 참여시키며 더 과감한 도전을 펼쳤다. '강남스타일'과 '젠틀맨'으로 역시 음원 강자로 우뚝 선 싸이도 연내 새 음반을 예고했다. 당초 이달 발매를 목표로 했으나 음반 작업 상황으로 인해 다소 미뤄진 상태다. 소속사인 YG엔터테인먼트 관계자는 ""지난여름부터 작곡가 유건형 씨와 함께 미국에서 음반 작업에 매진하고 있다""며 ""신곡 작업이 완성되는 시점에 맞춰 10월, 11월 등 글로벌한 출시 일정을 잡을 계획""이라고 전했다. 전속 계약 분쟁을 마치고 1년 만에 컴백하는 그룹 블락비가 오는 10월 2일 세 번째 미니앨범을 선보인다. 지난 23일 온라인에 먼저 공개한 수록곡 '빛이 되어줘'는 리더 지코가 만든 노래로 이날 일부 음원차트 1위 등 주요 차트 10위권에 진입했다. 뒤를 이어 10월 10일 걸그룹 티아라가 새 앨범으로 컴백한다. 팀멤버들의 탈퇴로 각종 구설에 올랐지만 그간 중독성 강한 노래로 음원차트 정상을 찍은 저력이 있고 새롭게 6인조로 컴백하는 만큼 화제성은 여전하다. JYJ의 김재중도 10월 말 솔로로 첫 번째 정규 앨범을 선보인다. 지난 1월 발표한 미니앨범 '마인(MINE)'이 록 장르임에도 리패키지 앨범을 포함해 20만 장의 판매량을 기록하며 탄탄한 팬덤을 자랑했다. 이번 앨범에는 한층 대중적인 록을 선보일 예정이어서 음원 차트 선전도 기대해볼 만하다. 이들은 앞서 후배들보다 음원 차트에서 다소 약세였지만 올해는 상반기 조용필, 이승철 등 중견 가수들의 앨범이 대중적으로 재조명 받은 해여서 새로운 돌풍이 기대된다. 계절적으로도 이들의 감성적인 음악이 맞아떨어지는 시기다. 신승훈은 10월 중순 미니앨범 '그레이트 웨이브(Great Wave)'를 낸다. 지난 2008년부터 시작한 3연 작 미니앨범 시리즈 '쓰리 웨이브스 오브 언익스펙티드 트위스트(3 waves of unexpected twist)'의 완결판이다. 소속사인 도로시컴퍼니 관계자는 ""녹음 막바지 단계로 믹싱, 마스터링 작업을 남겨뒀다""며 ""많은 시도와 변화, 다양성을 강조한 앨범""이라고 설명했다. 11월이 되면 이적이 5집을 낸다. 지난 2010년 4집 '사랑'을 발표한 이후 3년 만의 새 앨범이다. 이적은 최근 자신의 홈페이지와 트위터를 통해 앨범 작업 상황을 공개하고, 뮤직비디오 제작 현장 사진을 올려 궁금증을 유발했다. '토이'란 이름으로 앨범을 내는 유희열의 7집도 11-12월 중 출시된다. 지난 2007년 발표한 6집 '땡큐' 이후 6년 만에 발표하는 정규 앨범인 만큼 심혈을 기울여 작업 중으로 여느 때처럼 다양한 객원 보컬을 기용할 예정이다. <관련 영문 기사> Stellar lineup set to rock Korean music scene South Korean singers, from idol groups to veteran singer-songwriters, are set to liven up the music scene here with a slew of new albums set for release before the end of the year.

The group has been ranked fairly high on the local music charts with hooks and the new title song reportedly has a catchy melody. Block B, another idol band with a tough year, comes back to the stage on Oct. 2. The boy band has ended a year of legal battles over an exclusive contract with its former agency and unveiled “Be the Light,” one of the tracks, prior to the release of its third EP album, on Monday.

Masters of sentimental ballads which are suited for the fall and winter season also joined the lineup. Shin Seung-hun, nicknamed “the prince of ballads.” returns with EP “Great Wave” in October. The 45-year-old veteran signer highlighted diversity and new approaches to music through the album, according to Shin’s agency Dorothy Company. Fans of the project group Toy have waited six years for new songs after its sixth album “Thank you” in 2007. You Hee-yeol who leads the group is said to be working with various guest vocalists as usual. The musician has not yet elaborated on details, but it is only known that the album will be released within this year. Solo artist Lee Juck showed glimpse of the making process for his fifth album, which planned for release in November via Twitter. Lee gained popularity since his debut in 1995 in the duo Panic.

Roy Kim denies plagiarism accusation,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/16105,2013.07.16 20:07,"Singer Roy Kim’s agency on Tuesday denied rumors that Kim plagiarized a song by another musician while writing his debut single “Spring Spring Spring.” “After consulting several experts on the matter, we came to conclude that it is not plagiarism,” CJ E&M, the 20-year-old singer’s agency, said in an official statement The agency added that Kim and other artists who participated in the composition of the song had never listened to “Love is Canon” by indie artist Acoustic Rain, which Kim is suspected of copying. On Monday, the Internet swarmed with rumors that “Spring Spring Spring” from Kim’s first album “Love Love Love,” copied “Love is Canon.” The allegation was first raised in April. The first verses of the two songs follow similar melody lines, fueling speculation that Kim might have stolen the melody from the underground musician, who released the song last year. Kim’s fans and critics were at loggerheads online over whether the singer had copied the main theme of the acoustic ballad. Some online observers bombarded Kim’s radio program with requests for “Love is Canon.” “If you really did not copy his song, then please play this song,” wrote one netizen. It was revealed later in the day, however, that the song in question by Acoustic Rain was a variation of the original version. An official at the Korea Music Copyright Association told The Korea Herald on Tuesday that the ukulele version was registered in May this year, well after Kim had released “Spring Spring Spring” on April 22. It seems unlikely that the dispute will settle soon as many continue to question whether Kim’s song copied the key melody of the original “Love is Canon.” Some online users made a website called “Ro-jin-yo,” meaning “We demand the truth from Roy Kim” and demanded that the singer tell the truth about the alleged plagiarism.

U.N. to discuss further sanctions against N. Korea in July,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/13762,2013.06.20 10:46,"The U.N. committee on sanctioning North Korea plans to discuss as early as next month whether to impose further penalties against North Korea for carrying out its third nuclear test in February, sources with direct knowledge of the committee said Wednesday. During a meeting, the North Korean sanctions committee chaired by Luxembourg's Ambassador Sylvie Lucas put forth reports on its activities with regard to its latest sanctions and recommended blacklisting four more North Korean institutions and eight individuals, according to the sources. The four candidate entities for the blacklist are the North's newly created Ministry of Atomic Energy Industry, the Munitions Industry Department of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, the State Space Development Bureau, and Hesong Trading Corp. The individuals include the atomic energy industry minister, four senior officials at the Munitions Industry Department, two officials of the space development bureau and an official of the trading company, the sources said. The committee also aims to blacklist three non-Koreans -- Aleksandr Viktorovich Zykov from Kazakhstan, and two citizens of Ukraine, Iurii Lunov and Igor Karev-Popov -- for being involved in North Korea-related arms deals, they added. Part of the recommendations echo those from the report drawn by its monitoring group last month, which called for sanctioning a total of 15 North Korean entities and individuals, along with the three from Eastern Europe. ""Member states are scheduled to begin discussions around July on whether to put more North Korean institutions and individuals on the sanctioning list,"" a source familiar with the issue said, adding it will be ""up to the council whether it follows the recommendations."" ""The committee encouraged not only 15 security council members but all U.N. member states to actively and voluntarily implement those measures against North Korea to make them more effective,"" another source said. In March, the U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2094 to punish Pyongyang for its underground nuclear test on Feb 12, calling for the international community to toughen sanctions on the communist country and blacklisted 19 North-based firms and 12 figures. Under the resolution, U.N. member states are required to put tighter restrictions on North Korea's financial activities and conduct thorough inspections of air and sea cargo headed to the country.

'연기하는 아이돌' 랭킹 탑 7,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/13375,2013.06.12 14:20,"스크린에서 맹활약하는 아이돌들을 보는 것은 이젠 놀랄 일도 아니다. 그들에 대한 대중의 시선은 곱지 않았고, ‘연기자’ 보다는 ‘연기돌’ 이라는 수식어가 줄곧 따라다녔다. 그런 편견과 시선을 극복하고 ‘가수’와 ‘연기자’로써의 입지를 굳히고 있는 아이돌을 만나보자. 1. 박유천(JYJ) 2010년, 박유천이 처음 연기를 하겠다고 선언했을 때 사실 많은 사람들이 큰 기대를 갖고 있지 않았다. 하지만 그는 KBS2 드라마 “성균관 스캔들”로 브라운스크린에 첫발을 들이는 순간부터 이선준역을 훌륭하게 소화해냈다는 평을 들었다. 대중성을 지니면서도 너무 뻔하지 않은 캐릭터를 표현할 수 있는 퓨전 사극이라는 장르를 선택한 것은 어찌 보면 그에게는 최선의 선택이지 않았나 싶다. 차기 작품은 로멘틱 코미디 같은 말랑말랑한 소재로 안정적인 길을 선택했을 수도 있지만, 박유천은 기대와는 달리 정통 멜로 드라마를 택했다. 이다해와 호흡을 맞췄던 MBC 드라마 “미스 리플리”에서 진정한 연기자로 인정받을 수 있는 기회를 얻었고, 작년에 출연했던 SBS 드라마 “옥탑방 왕세자”와 올해 초 종영된 MBC 드라마 “보고싶다” 또한 그의 무한한 잠재력을 입증할 수 있는 작품이었다. 그는 연기 데뷔를 한지 3년만에 완벽한 연기로 호평을 받으며 KBS 연기대상, 백상예술대상, MBC 연기대상, SBS 연기대상까지 4관왕을 차지했다. 2. 이정신(CNBLUE) KBS2 주말드라마 “내 딸 서영이”가 처음 방영됐을 때, 이정신의 표정과 몸짓 하나 하나에서 그가 아무 경험 없이 처음 연기한다는 티가 조금씩 묻어 났다. 그는 잃을 것이 없었기에 남들보다 더 열심히 했고, 초반에 보였던 어색함을 뒤로한 채 50부작이 진행되는 동안 몰라보게 발전한 연기실력을 보여줬다. 발전보다 진화했다는 표현이 더 어울릴지도 모르겠다. 게다가 천호진, 김혜옥 같은 베테랑 연기자들을 옆에 두었으니 그 또한 시작하는 연기자에게 얼마나 좋은 환경인가. 이정신이 속한 CNBLUE의 나머지 멤버 3명이 먼저 연기를 시작했었던 것 또한 큰 자극이 됐을 것이라 생각된다. 그룹 리더 정용화는 이미 SBS 드라마 “미남이시네요”와 MBC “넌 내게 반했어”로 연기 호평을 받아왔기에 팀에서 마지막으로 연기 출사표를 던진 그에겐 부담이 더 컸을 것이다. 결과적으로 “내 딸 서영이”는 이정신에게 다양한 연령층의 팬을 확보함과 동시에 그룹 내에서 베이시스트로써의 존재감을 더 부각시킬 수 있는 계기를 마련해 주었다. 3. 아이유 2011년 KBS2 “드림하이” 방영 이후로 아이돌들의 스크린 진입이 그 절정을 달했다. 드림하이에서 이미 2PM 택연, 우영, 티아라 은정, 미쓰에이 수지까지 아이돌들이 대거 출동 했고, “드림하이2”에서는 티아라 지연, 씨스타 효린, 가희, 에일리등이 연기에 도전하게 됐다. 드림하이 시리즈가 배출한 가장 성공적인 스타는 단연 아이유와 수지다. 아이유의 비중이 많지는 않았지만 “드림하이""는 아이유의 연기 생활에 초석이 되어줬다. 현재 방영되고 있는 KBS2 주말 드라마 “최고다 이순신”에서는 ’캔디'같은 캐릭터로 많은 사랑을 받고 있다. 연기력에 대한 평은 엇갈리고 있지만, 아직도 20회나 넘게 남았기에 그녀의 발전하는 연기실력을 지켜보는 재미도 쏠쏠할 것 같다. 앞으로의 스크린 행보가 더욱더 기대되는 아이돌이다. 4. 서인국 서인국이 오디션 프로그램을 떠나 가수로써 무대에 섰을 땐 그닥 많은 주목을 받지 못했다. ”남자의 자격” 같은 예능에 출연하는 노력에도 불구하고 “슈퍼스타K에 나온 걔”라는 수식어가 꽤 오래 갔다. 데뷔한지 3년 뒤에 정은지와 함께 tvN “응답하라 1997”에 출연하면서 서인국의 운명은 바뀌기 시작했다. 드라마로 생긴 90년대 열풍을 타고 비로서 “슈퍼스타K에 걔”가 아닌 서인국이란 이름을 찾으며, MBC 주말드라마 “아들 녀석들”에서 연기자로써의 명성을 다지고 1년만에 가수의 자리로 돌아왔다. 5. 배수지(미쓰에이) “첫사랑” 아이콘으로 우뚝 선 수지. “드림하이”에서 연기에 발을 들였을 때만 해도 그녀가 2012년 ‘박스오피스 퀸’이 되리라고 누가 예상 했을까. 이용주 감독의 “건축학개론”은 411만명이 넘는 관객을 몰고 수지를 스타덤에 올려놓았다. 아직도 수지를 볼 때마다 영화 OST인 “다시 사랑한다 말할까”가 흘러나오는 것만 같은 기분이 든다. 그녀는 데뷔작의 영향을 아직도 받고 있긴 하지만 첫 결과가 너무 성공적이었던 탓일까? 작년에 방영됐던 KBS2 “빅”과 MBC “구가의 서”에서는 기대했던 만큼의 성과는 못보이고 있다. 그래도 당분간 다른 여배우들과 아이돌들이 수지의 “첫사랑 아이콘”을 넘보기는 힘들 것 같다. 6. 최시원 최시원은 슈퍼주니어로 데뷔하기 전 KBS2 “부모님 전상서”에 출연하면서 연기자로써 먼저 얼굴을 알렸다. SBS 드라마 “천일의 약속”과 KBS2 드라마 “엄마가 뿔났다” 같은 수많은 히트작을 배출했던 김수현 작가의 드라마에서 연기의 첫발을 들인 그는 스크린과 TV를 오가며 필모그래피를 쌓았다. 그러던 그는 작년 11월부터 방영했던 SBS “드라마의 제왕”에서 제대로 빛을 내기 시작했다. 4차원적인 한류 스타 캐릭터를 소화해내면서 연기자로써도 전혀 손색없는 모습을 보여줬다. 연기에 지속적인 관심을 보여온 최시원이 진정한 “드라마의 제왕”이 될지는 지켜볼 일이다. 7. 김동완 김동완 또한 신화로 데뷔하기 전 MBC 드라마 ”산""에서 연기를 시작했다. 신화로 활동하는 와중에도 지속적으로 스크린에 얼굴을 비추며 경험을 탄탄히 쌓았다. 특유의 ‘스마일 페이스’로 2002년에는 KBS2 “천국의 아이들”에서 주인공 기호태 역을 맡았고 그로부터 4년 뒤엔 박선영과 함께 KBS2 “슬픔이여 안녕”에서도 주연으로 출연했다. ’1세대 아이돌‘인 그는 오랜 노력 끝에 비로소 2011년 MBC 광복절 특집 2부작 “절정”이라는 작품에서 이육사 역을 연기하게 됐고 이 드라마는 휴스턴국제영화제(WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival) 특집극 부문에서 대상을 받았다. “절정”이 김동완에게 기존 연기 스타일을 더 다듬고, 연기자의 타이틀을 거머쥘 수 있는 하나의 전환점이 되어주지 않았나 싶다. 석지현 기자 (monicasuk@heraldcorp.com) <관련 영문 기사> Top 7 idol-turned-actors There was a time when critics were not so generous in apprasing idol stars who took to acting on the big or small screen. While that prejudice is still alive, many of them have successfully overcome criticism to grow into full-fledged actors. 1. Park Yu-chun Not many people had high expectations for Park Yu-chun in 2010 when the singer said he would start acting. Park made his first appearance on the small screen with “Sungkyunkwan Scandal” and excelled at portraying Lee Sun-joon in the fusion historical drama. The selection of genre for his acting debut was perhaps an ideal one, as fusion historical dramas have historically had mass appeal. Park could have chosen the safe path of acting by choosing a romantic comedy as his follow-up project. Against his fans’ expectations, he decided to go for melodrama. With “Miss Ripley” costarring Lee Da-hae, he built his reputation as an actor. The last two dramas he starred in -- “Rooftop Prince” and “Missing You” -- also confirmed his talent for acting. Just three years into his acting career, the JYJ member garnered four major acting awards, in the KBS Drama Acting Awards in 2010, Paeksang Arts Awards and MBC Drama Awards in 2011, and SBS Drama Awards in 2012. 2. Lee Jung-shin It was evident at the beginning of “My Daughter Seo-young” that Lee Jung-shin was starting from scratch. Beginning from zero, he had nothing to lose, and he had veteran actors such as Chun Ho-jin and Kim Hye-ok as mentors. Leaving all the awkward reactions and facial expressions in the earlier part of the story, his acting skills remarkably improved through the 50-part series. Competition between the CNBLUE members could have been the strongest motivation for the bassist. All four band mates have experience in acting including leader Jung Yong-hwa, who played in “You’re Beautiful” and “Heartstrings.” With “My Daughter Seo-young,” the musician gained wider recognition as an actor as well. 3. IU The influx of idols in the K-drama sphere reached its peak in 2011 when “Dream High” first hit the airwaves. TV screens were brimming with young artists such as Taecyeon and Wooyoung of 2PM, Eunjung of Tiara and Bae Suzy of MissA. IU did not have many scenes in her debut drama but she made a stepping stone of it and landed her first lead role in “You’re the Best, Lee Soon-shin.” Already a successful singer, IU’s acting success is likely to be judged by her current drama and the next role. 4. Seo In-guk The winner of Mnet’s audition program “Superstar K” did not have much luck when he first made his debut as a singer. Seo In-guk had also tried appearing on variety shows to make himself known, but he was always tagged as “the guy from Superstar K.” His fate began to change forever when he starred in “Respond 1997” with Jung Eun-ji of girl group A Pink. Riding the waves of ’90s sensation the drama made, Seo finally kicked the label of “the guy from Superstar K” and found his real name. After making his appearance in the weekend series “Rascal Sons,” Seo came back to where he belongs and gained further popularity through a new album. 5. Bae Suzy Without a doubt, Bae Suzy is the most successful actress among idol singers. She gave acting a try in “Dream High” but no one had expected that she would become the queen of local box office last year. “Architecture 101,” Lee Yong-joo’s megahit film that lured 4.1 million moviegoers last year, launched Bae into stardom and gave her the nickname of “everyone’s first crush.” Although she still has that reputation from her debut flick, Bae has not been able to meet her fans’ expectations in “Big” and “Gu Family Book.” 6. Choi Si-won Choi Si-won made his name known as an actor before making his debut K-pop group Super Junior. His first drama “Precious Family” was written by popular script writer Kim Soo-hyun, who also wrote “A Thousand Days’ Promise” and “Mom’s Dead Upset.” After playing several minor and main roles both on the small and big screens he made a breakthrough in his acting career last year with “The King of Dramas.” Choi received positive reviews for depicting his character Kang Hyun-min, a handsome but short-tempered and egoistic actor. Proving himself a real heartthrob, he made a smooth start to become the king of dramas. 7. Kim Dong-wan Kim Dong-wan was an actor at the age of 17 before becoming a member of boy band Shinhwa. The “Hey Come On” singer kept his dream as an actor while pursuing singing activities. With his trademark smiley face he landed more roles in popular dramas such as “Children of Heaven” in 2002 and “A Farewell to Sorrow” in 2005. In 2011, Kim played the male lead in “The Peak,” set during the Japanese colonial rule. The two-part series was recognized by the WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival and took the grand prize in the TV Special-Dramatic segment. Critics say the award-winning drama provided Kim a chance to go beyond his former style of acting and helped him mature as an actor.

Loen vows action over IU wedding rumors,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/11720,2013.05.28 20:13,"K-pop singer-actor IU’s agency has asked the police to investigate rumors that she is to marry Super Junior idol star Eunhyuk. In a press statement issued Monday, Loen Entertainment said it would also seek legal action against people who spread what it said were false rumors. Wedding rumors have surfaced this week surrounding the two stars, with their names being the most searched keywords on local Internet search engines on Monday afternoon. The rumors began to spread on various online sites claiming that two have plans to wed in October. However, representatives from IU’s agency, Loen Entertainment, have denied all the speculations, stating that IU has not expressed any desire to get married anytime soon. “These are the sort of absurd rumors that you should just laugh off,” said Loen Entertainment officials. An online community published a post claiming that a famous solo female singer “A,” who is currently starring in a popular drama, is secretly planning an October wedding with a certain boy band idol star “H.” It also went on to state that “A’s” agency was not encouraging the alleged upcoming nuptials.

Italy's ex-premier Giulio Andreotti dies at 94,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10360,2013.05.06 21:59,"Giulio Andreotti personified the nation he helped shape, the good and the bad. One of Italy's most important postwar figures, he helped draft the country's constitution after World War II, served seven times as premier and spent 60 years in Parliament. But the Christian Democrat who was friends with popes and cardinals was also a controversial figure who survived corruption scandals and allegations of aiding the Mafia: Andreotti was accused of exchanging a “kiss of honor” with the mob's longtime No. 1 boss and was indicted in what was called “the trial of the century” in Palermo. He was eventually cleared, but his legacy was forever marred. Still clinging to his last official title, senator-for-life, Andreotti died Monday at age 94 after an extended period of poor health that included a hospitalization for a heart ailment. Andreotti grew more stooped with age, and infirmity kept him from what few official duties remained, such as opening the inaugural session of the new Senate in March, a privilege reserved for the eldest-serving member that fell this time to the next-in-line. Andreotti, a key player in the Christian Democratic Party that dominated politics for nearly half a century, helped bring prosperity to what was once one of Europe's poorest countries. When a corruption scandal flushed out the old political guard in the 1990s, marking the end of the first Italian Republic, he survived. But he lost political clout after he became a senator-for-life in 1991, an appointment that freed him from electoral cycles but also deprived him of capital in the backroom deal-making that helped create his reputation as a Machiavellian politician. And so, Italy entered the so-called second republic, characterized by stalemates and infighting, and dominated by other men, such as Silvio Berlusconi. Arguably among Italy's most important statesmen, having also served eight times as defense minister and five times as foreign minister, Andreotti will be buried with a small private Mass, not a state funeral befitting of his contributions to the nation. The choice was made by his family, according to Italian media, and is perhaps a reflection of his mixed legacy. The condolences that flowed in also underscored Italy's uncertain judgment on a figure who dominated discourse for decades. In announcing the death, Rome Mayor Gianni Alemanno called Andreotti “the most representative politician” Italy had known in its recent history. Pier Ferdinando Casini, a centrist political leader, said he was certain that “history will give this statesman a more sober and serious opinion than his detractors made during his life.” President Giorgio Napolitano, at 87 a contemporary of Andreotti, said history would judge his career but he wanted to extend a national salute to a man who represented Italy overseas and in Europe with “exceptional” skill. Center-left Premier Enrico Letta was similarly cautious in his condolences, saying Andreotti was a first-rate “protagonist” in Italy's democracy and public life. Andreotti's political career was as varied as it was long, with posts covering everything from cinema to sports. Born in 1919, he once noted that he had outlived two other Italian phenomena that emerged that year: fascism and the precursor of his Christian Democrats, the Italian Popular Party. “Of all three, only I remain,” he said. Andreotti was well-known for his political acumen, subtle humor and witty allusions. With sharp eyes, thin lips and a stooped figure, he was immediately recognizable to generations of Italians. Friends and foes alike admired his intellectual agility and his grasp of the issues. Andreotti's rise in the Italian political scene mirrored the rise of Italy, which was emerging from two decades of fascist dictatorship under Benito Mussolini. He joined the conservative Christian Democrats, was part of the assembly that wrote the constitution and was elected to Parliament in 1948. He remained there ever since. He held a series of Cabinet positions after World War II until he became premier for the first time in 1972. Twenty years later, he finished his last stint as premier. Although staunchly pro-American and a firm supporter of Italy's NATO membership, Andreotti was the first Christian Democrat to accept Communist support, even if indirect, in one of his governments. The Cabinet that was formed after big Communist gains in the 1976 election needed the Communists and other leftists to abstain _ rather than cast “no” votes _ during parliamentary votes. In Washington, State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell called Andreotti a “friend to the United States” who ably represented Italy in transatlantic relations, but said he would leave it to historians and the Italian people to judge his legacy. By the early 1990s, a vast anti-corruption drive led by Italian prosecutors _ the “Clean Hands” probe _ swept through parliament and hobbled most political parties. Andreotti's Christian Democrats were among them, but the scandal did not touch him personally and he managed to stay on as premier until an election in 1992. Soon, however, an even more damaging accusation would hit Andreotti. In 1993, a Mafia informer told prosecutors that Andreotti had been involved in the 1979 slaying of Mino Pecorelli, a muckraking journalist killed in a mob-style execution in Rome by four shots from a pistol with a silencer. Pecorelli's articles had often targeted Andreotti, along with a range of public figures. Andreotti was sometimes referred to in print as “The Godfather.” The prosecution argued that the Mafia killed Pecorelli at the behest of Andreotti, who allegedly feared the reporter had dug up compromising information. Andreotti has always denied the charges, saying he was targeted by mobsters who were trying to get even for his crackdowns on organized crime. The lengthy case _ dubbed by the Italian press “the trial of the century” _ resulted in an acquittal in 1999; a shock conviction and a sentence of 24 years in prison by an appeals court in November 2002; and, in the third and final judgment a year later, another acquittal. “Some might have hoped I wouldn't get here. But here I am, thanks to God,” Andreotti, then 84, said at the time of the final ruling. In a separate case during the same years, Andreotti stood trial in Palermo on charges that he colluded with the Mafia. But he was cleared in that case, too. Palermo prosecutors relied heavily on accounts by Mafia turncoats, including a mobster who testified that Andreotti had once exchanged a “kiss of honor” with Salvatore Riina, the “boss of all bosses” and a longtime fugitive captured in 1993. They alleged Andreotti granted the mob favors in exchange for their delivering Sicilian votes for his party. Andreotti also denied those charges, again maintaining he was a victim of mobsters seeking revenge for his fight against the Mafia. Berlusconi, the three-time premier who himself has been the target of prosecutors' probes over the years, called Andreotti an “icon” against whom Italy's leftists fought battles “based on demonizing their adversary and judicial persecution, a trial Andreotti overcame with dignity and composure _ and won.” Andreotti was born to schoolteachers in Rome on Jan. 14, 1919. He earned a law degree at Rome University and became a journalist after graduation. During World War II he worked as a librarian in the Vatican, and it was there that he met several politicians, including Alcide De Gasperi, later one of Italy's foremost postwar statesman. At age 35, Andreotti became Italy's youngest interior minister. It was the beginning of a career during which he navigated the Byzantine world of Italian politics like no other, accumulating power, honors and enemies along the way. Such was his reach that he was sometimes called “Divo Giulio” _ a play on his name Giulio and the Latin “Divus Iulius” (or Divine Julius), which was used for Julius Caesar. His critics called him Beelzebub for what they considered his diabolical skills. The one political prize he never achieved was to become president of the republic, a largely ceremonial but highly regarded office. He came closest in 1992, but his efforts failed amid the “Clean Hands” corruption scandals. A devout Roman Catholic, Andreotti maintained solid ties to the Vatican throughout his political career. His Rome address was close to the centers of political power but also just across the Tiber from St. Peter's Square. He wrote numerous books, some of them best-sellers, wrote articles for Italian publications and edited the monthly Catholic magazine 30 Giorni. He was courted on TV shows for his deep knowledge of Italian and world affairs as well as for his humor. A probing portrait of him in the film “Il Divo” was honored with the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 2008. He even made a guest appearance as himself in the movie, “Il Tassinaro” (“The Taxi Driver”) with the late comedian Alberto Sordi. The Italian Olympic Committee CONI said a moment of silence would be held at all sporting events this week to honor his service as president of the organizing committee of the 1960 Rome Olympics. Andreotti was married to Livia Danese. He is survived by his wife, their four children and their grandchildren. (AP)",,iu
[Lee Jae-min] Time to eradicate IUU fishing,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/8842,2013.04.16 19:47,"While largely unnoticed under the stack of North Korea-related news, an alarming and embarrassing report has been released. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce submitted its 2013 report to U.S. Congress, in which it had designated 10 countries as having engaged in IUU fishing activities: Colombia, Ecuador, Ghana, Italy, Mexico, Panama, Spain, Tanzania, Venezuela and South Korea. IUU is an acronym for Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing activities that occur in contravention of the domestic laws and regulation and international guidelines. In other words, the 10 countries in the report are identified as those that are not sufficiently regulating illegal fishing activities conducted by their own nationals and vessels. A potential trade ban against fish stocks from these countries is also being mentioned in the report unless concrete measures are taken by these countries within the next two years. The fact that Korea is the only country in the list from East Asia further embarrasses us ― neither China nor Taiwan nor Japan is included in the list although they largely share similar fishing patterns and maritime policies. Likewise, the EU has also registered its concern over Korea’s IUU fishing. So have various NGOs. As a matter of fact, in the global fisheries community, nothing could carry a more negative connotation than the term “IUU.” It has been one of the top priorities of the U.N.’s FAO, and a significant global effort has been mobilized recently because it has been found to be one of the major culprits of the global depletion of fish stocks: The FAO statistics show that almost 30 percent of global fish catch is done through IUU fishing. Now, the depletion of fish stocks has become an urgent global issue. Under the current pace of global fishing, the FAO warns that quite a few fish stocks will disappear in the next couple of decades: As of 2008, 1 out of 3 fish stocks are regarded as overexploited, meaning that they are going down the path of depletion. This sense of urgency also led the global community to include this very issue in the WTO’s DDA negotiations as one of the key negotiation topics, under the theme of fisheries subsidies. And, again, the IUU has been at the center of all these discussions and negotiations. It is all the more troubling to remember that Korea has been one of the most active participants in the fisheries subsidies negotiations, with its vocal criticism of IUU fishing. Furthermore, IUU fishing has been criticized in terms of the “development” aspect as well. Foreign vessels’ destructive fishing activities with drag nets along the coastal seas of small island states or impoverished countries have been regarded as taking away a critical means of livelihood from them. No wonder least-developed countries have long complained about the IUU vessels flocking their coastal waters to pillage marine resources. Having realized the negative publicity and embarrassment associated with the IUU fishing activities, the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, one of the new ministries created under the new administration, has attempted to respond promptly. It has just issued several policy plans, including proposals to amend relevant statutes to increase penalties for violators. Explanatory materials are also being circulated by the ministry. Upon careful reading of the report, however, one would realize that the foreign criticism of Korea does not lie in the laws and regulations. Rather, the core problem raised by the foreign watchers relates to the lack of “effective” enforcement of the laws and regulations in force. As with anything, this can only be achieved through strong willingness of the agency in charge and its officials, with clear policy determination to enforce the laws and regulations as best as they can, so as to eradicate the IUU. One of the best justifications for the resurrection of the new maritime ministry will be to take a serious first step in this direction. Korea’s inclusion in the U.S. list of countries conducting illegal fishing activities with nine other states is both embarrassing and alarming. Negative publicity aside, it can also lead to a serious trade ban or other types of restriction. More importantly, other watchful countries may follow suit, unless a quick remedial action is taken by Korea.

Korea celebrates International Forest Day,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/6740,2013.03.20 20:28,"Korea Forest Service to hold workshop, promote tree-planting campaign Thursday marks the first International Forest Day that the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed in December last year to encourage all U.N. member countries to organize forest-related activities, including tree-planting campaigns. This new annual global celebration of forests builds on the success of the International Year of Forests in 2011 and provides a platform to raise awareness of the importance of forests and trees outside forests. On the first International Day of Forests, countries are encouraged to organize a variety of activities involving forests and trees. Korea has prepared for a variety of outreach events to celebrate the special day ranging from an international seminar to a nationwide tree-planting campaign. One of highlighted events is the International Workshop on Forest Landscape Restoration, which will be held in Seoul. With the expected participation of more than 150 people from government agencies, research institutions, academia and civil society, the event brings together major players in the field, including the International Union for Conservation of Nature, Food and Agriculture Organization and International Tropical Timber Organization. The workshop will be a platform for sharing respective experiences and promoting cooperation, the Korea Forest Service said in a press release. Key speakers for the event include IUCN global director Stewart Maginnis and FAO senior forestry official Patrick Durst, who is responsible for the Asia-Pacific region. In particular, the seminar gives the audience a chance to learn about the negative impact of deforestation on people’s lives. Deforestation often results in biodiversity loss, desertification, land degradation and climate change, leading to both economic loss and social poverty. To effectively cope with issues of deforestation and forest degradation, the Bonn Challenge was launched in 2011 as a global effort to restore 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested land by 2020. During the workshop, Korea’s forest rehabilitation and restoration case will also be presented as a model case. Beyond the international workshop, KFS officials said Korea will continue to remind people of the importance of forests and trees during March and April, which includes National Arbor Day, April 5. This year marks the 68th National Arbor Day in Korea. On every Arbor Day, a tree-planting campaign takes place across the country, including central and local government offices, villages, army bases, workplaces and schools. Proclaimed in 1946, National Arbor Day in Korea has become an ideal venue to promote harmony among the people of Korea, as well as raising public awareness of the important contribution of forests in addressing environmental challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss. On Arbor Day, President Park Geun-hye will join the planting campaign. About 100,000 people from 283 central and local government agencies will participate in tree planting activities. About 1 million trees will be planted across 500 hectares nationwide. The “My Tree Campaign” will be launched on the same day to promote a national consensus on the need for sustainable management of forests. Individuals are encouraged to participate by planting trees with their name tags on. As for other activities to raise public awareness on going green, KFS will give away 1 million trees at the 175 subway stations across the nation to promote planting to the public. During March and April, the National Forestry Cooperatives Federation will organize 135 tree markets across the country to provide more than 6 million high-quality seedlings at reasonable prices.

Korean drama sued over title,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/5865,2013.03.12 15:13,"A student organization named DN has filed an injunction request for KBS drama “You’re the best, Lee Sun-shin” for allegedly undercutting the public image of Admiral Yi Sun-shin. The organization, made up of some 30 Korean students studying abroad, filed a complaint with the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office against KBS for distorting the image of the famous Joseon-era general. The drama’s title contains the name of the heroic Korean figure, but the actual main character is a struggling female jobseeker whose name is also Lee Sun-shin. “Admiral Yi Sun-shin’s image of victory and courage is misleading as the female actress playing the role of Lee Sun-shin is portrayed to be clumsy and fragile,” said a member of DN. The historical figure Yi Sun-shin was a naval commander in the 16th century and is widely respected by Koreans for helping defend the country against the 1592 Japanese invasion. A statue of Admiral Yi overlooks Gwanghwamun Plaza in central Seoul. According to the student organization, the drama’s title could undermine citizens’ constitutional rights. The weekend drama made its debut on March 9 and top singer IU plays the title role of Lee Sun-shin. By Kim Ji-yeon, Intern reporter (jiyeon.kim23@heraldcorp.com) <관련 한글 기사> ‘최고다 이순신’ 소송, 대체 왜?

"Upo Wetlands full of life, history and beauty",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2550,2013.01.30 20:39,"UNESCO World Heritage candidate site shows raw nature In the far southern region of Changnyeong, South Gyeongsang Province, is a spread of wetlands ― Upo, one of the most visited natural sites in the country. In early morning, the wet fog on the wetland’s surface creates a misty and mysterious atmosphere, while during the day, the greens accentuate the primitive nature. At sunset, the sun smudges the sky and creates a spectacular scene ― if you are lucky you may observe troupes of migratory birds flying across the setting sun. At night, the insects and animals start to create noise, beautiful enough to sit back and listen to. It is a peaceful, serene yet dynamic end to the day. The Upo Wetlands have been on the UNESCO World Heritage Site Tentative List since 2011. The wetlands, composed of 2.3 square kilometers of main wetland and many smaller ones scattered around it, were previously inscribed on the Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance in 1998. Endangered species’ shelter More than 180 bird species can be seen in Upo, including at least 10 endangered species. Anas falcate and Anas formosa are included in the IUCN Red Data Book, according to UNESCO. Those observed in the area include Platalea leucorodia (first-class endangered species designated by the Korean government), Anser fabalis, Cygnus cygnus, Cygnus olor, Anas formosa, Falco subbuteo and Charadrius placidus (second-class endangered species). The Korean authorities instituted a special project in 2008 to restore the crested ibis, believed to have been extinct at the site. The birds have managed to spawn and breed thanks to the Chinese government, which sent a pair as a gift. The wetlands are also home to numerous plant species. Typha orientalis C. presl, acorus calamus L, reed, zizania latifolia, eleocharis kuroguwai ohwi, hornwort, arrowhead, and Euryale ferox salisb are just a few of the plants that contribute to the green, fresh, dynamic world of Upo. History Koreans did not appreciate the value of Upo until recently. Ancient Koreans took nature as it was and preserved it as such without labeling it or limiting its use for preservation. There are a few historical records of a stream and waters in the area, but their geography hardly matches the current Upo site. The name Upo appeared during the Japanese colonial period (1910-1945) and some residents still use the Joseon era (1392-1910) nicknames for the area such as Sobeol, Namubeol or Moraebeol. In 1918, a 50,000:1 scale map of Korea was issued for the first time, with the word Upo emerging for the first time as well. “Upo is the largest inland body of water in Korea aside from Cheonji, the caldera lake at the top of Mt. Baekdu,” the government recorded in another document. Upo was designated Natural Monument No. 15 in 1933 as part of a cultural preservation strategy. In 1962, more than a decade after liberation, the site was designated a South Korean Natural Monument for being the homeland of swans, but in 1973 the designation was withdrawn as the birds no longer came to the area. Preservation efforts Since the withdrawal of the Natural Monument designation, Upo has been at the center of controversy surrounding development which led to damage of its ecosystem. In 1997, aiming to restrict excessive fishing and collection of marsh snails, the government once again designated the area an Ecological Conservation Area, followed by the inscription on the Ramsar. “Since then, the government has purchased the surrounding lands of the area to put the ecosystem and other areas under tight monitoring,” the Upo Wetland Management Office said on its website. Future The local governments ― the offices of South Gyeongsang Province and Changnyeong County ― joined hands with local scholars in pushing the wetlands to be designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. “It is actually the best way to protect the natural site and its ecological system,” said Do Yuno, researcher at Pusan National University.

Hyundai unveils new Equus after four years,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10377992,2012.11.28 19:38,"Art Deco-inspired Rolls-Royce makes Asian debut in Seoul Rolls-Royce’s Art Deco-inspired Ghost (Rolls-Royce Motor Cars) Hyundai Motor and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars unveiled their most prestigious segment cars separately on Wednesday in Cheongdam-dong, a district strewn with luxury designers’ boutiques in southern Seoul. Hyundai, Korea’s largest carmaker, introduced the more luxurious version of its upscale sedan Equus, four years after the previous launch ahead of its official sale starting early December. Though there is no drastic change in exterior design, the chrome grille and LED headlamps have a more sophisticated styling, while the rear combination lamps were also newly designed to emphasize a serene, modern image. Special features like full-color head-up display, premium sound system supported by Harman International, digital transmission control, and retractable window shades made of glass are all integrated into basic options for the latest model. Hyundai Motor’s new Equus (Kim Myung-sub/The Korea Herald) The security system has also been enhanced to support the advanced-technology smart cruise control that starts or stops the car based on the car’s distance from the vehicle in front of it and the warning system for when the vehicle is within another’s blind spot. The carmaker did not unveil the retail price of the new model, citing the official launch schedule next month. “Based on product quality and reasonable price, the new Equus will secure a special competitiveness against import cars in the nation’s ultra-premium segment,” said a Hyundai official. On the same day, Rolls-Royce, the English manufacturer of ultra-luxury cars, launched a new Ghost saloon, one of the three exclusive models inspired by the Art Deco movement in the early 20th century, for the first time in Asia. Only 20 limited vehicles have been produced for the Art Deco Ghost edition and one of them was iunveiled to local press on the day. The retail price of the made-to-order premium sedan starts from 473 million won ($435,000). All the design details such as simplicity in form and sweeping lines reflect the artistic movement that stemmed from Paris. Wood frames used in the interior design are handmade by craftsmen. “Korea is one of the most important markets for us and still has a lot of potential for further growth in sales. That’s why we chose Korea for the Art Deco edition’s Asian debut,” Brenda Pek, Asia Pacific marketing head, told The Korea Herald. In Korea, some 20 Rolls-Royce vehicles are sold every year.

Personality sets Hanyang students apart,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10375622,2012.10.22 19:46,"President Lim says Hanyang diversifying to lead new growth sectors As a pioneer in engineering education in Korea, Hanyang University has played a key role in the Miracle of the Han by supplying talent for the electronic, mechanical, automotive, steel and construction industries. The school, founded in 1939 as a small polytechnic college, is one of Korea’s top 10 universities, with strengths in engineering, medicine and applied sciences. Its ability to meet the needs of industries, close cooperation with companies and constant self-reforms to that end have underpinned its growth for 70 years. The school is now facing another major transformation to cope with a fast-changing environment. Innovation, imagination and inter-disciplinary convergences are key to success in industry and academia. Korea, a global leader in the technology industry, can no longer resort to its past “catch-up” development strategy, but must carve out new frontiers for growth. “Hanyang University has led the country’s industrialization drive so far, but industry is now calling for new growth engines for further development. We’ve been focusing on developing new fields of study,” Lim Duck-ho, its president, said in an interview with The Korea Herald. “We aim to train students with knowledge of advanced technologies, a sense of morality and responsibility and an international perspective to stand out in the global market,” he added. New frontiers The convergence of information technology and the automobile industry is one of its latest priority areas. The Department of Automotive Engineering signed in 2011 an agreement with Hyundai Motor Group, the country’s biggest automobile company, to establish a joint research institute at the Seoul campus. The school earlier this year secured government funding worth 3.4 billion won ($3 million) to open the IT and Automobile Center at its main campus in Seoul. HYU is also planning to run two new majors; actuarial science and robot engineering, from next year at its campus in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province. The actuarial science major, which applies mathematical and statistical methods to assess risk in the insurance and finance industries, is already popular among European and American institutions, but HYU is the first Korean university to introduce such a course, according to Lim. “There is a greater need for experts who are capable of analyzing probability and statistics for business. Also considering the greater needs of robot engineering in various fields, we decided to set up a Department of Robot Engineering,” Lim said. Lim Duck-ho, president of Hanyang University. (HYU) Other robot engineering courses, he added, tend to focus on electronic engineering to build robots. But HYU’s course is designed to nurture experts with all-around knowledge of the robot industry. Lim said that industry-university cooperation was the driving force behind Hanyang’s successful efforts to put ideas and innovation into practice. Hanyang’s school of engineering has its origins in DongA Polytechnic Institute, which opened its doors in 1939. “Over the past 70 years, Hanyang has played a key role in the education and training of professionals in the fields of engineering, science and technology,” Lim said. HYU has been expanding partnerships with the country’s leading business firms, such as Samsung Electronics, to train students to meet the needs of business. Samsung Electronics, for instance, helped open a software research course in 2011, offering full scholarships upon admission and opportunities for graduates work at its companies. As part of its effort to become a world-class research institution, HYU launched the Industry University Cooperation Foundation in 2003 to create a more cooperative environment for research and high-quality professional training. The IUCF currently operates various entities for industry collaboration, including the Center for Business Incubation and the Technology Transfer Center, which has been responsible for producing R&D achievements through collaboration with prominent companies such as LG, Hynix and Samsung, he said. One of the Hanyang’s strengths is proximity and accessibility, said the president. The HYU’s main campus located in Sungdong District, central Seoul is directly linked to Hanyang University Station on Subway Line No. 2. In fact, the subway exit is within the campus, offering accessibility to anywhere in the city. Hanyang’s second campus, the ERICA campus, is located in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, some 40 kilometers south of Seoul. As the name ERICA ― short for Education, Research and Industry Cluster at Ansan ― suggests, the campus is in an ideal locale for cooperation between business firms and universities, the president said. More than 150 business firms and institutions, such as Korea Institute of Industrial Technology, Gyeonggi Technopark Korea Testing Laboratory and Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute, are located at the ERICA campus, he said. “The ERICA is leading the way in creating an industry-university-research cluster,” he said. Lim, well known for his hard work, took the helm of HYU in March 2011 after serving more than 20 years as a professor. Lim set the goal of making HYU one of the world’s top 100 universities when it turns 100 in 2039. School reform He has successfully led a reform drive with a management style emphasizing flexibility and autonomy, and an educational philosophy stressing globalization and diversity. He allowed each department of the school to budget themselves and determine admission for students and faculty members, minimizing the university’s administration role. Lim said “liberal management based on responsibility” is one of the key goals he purses as the head of HYU. “Self-controlled management is what I believe to be the source of creative administration, so much in need in our generation. The environment surrounding universities is changing rapidly. In order to keep the pace up, and make sure all 104 courses at HYU run smoothly, each department has to be managed autonomously under the responsibility of its deans. And the administration office needs to just observe through regular audits and evaluation,” he said. In keeping with the era of globalization, Lim has also been working hard to extend international exchange activities with other universities around the world. As a result, HYU is currently in partnerships with 393 universities in more than 40 countries and runs overseas study programs at 104 institutions around the world. Also thanks to its diversified efforts to attract competent foreign students, each year about 1,900 full-time and part-time foreign students study at Hanyang. Lim also stresses the importance of well-balanced learning in liberal arts and practical areas as a basis for nurturing creative leaders. All HYU students are required to take the “classic literature reading” class and are advised to read 75 classic literary works selected by the university. “Having a broad range of understanding in liberal arts is essential to being a creative leader in this globalized world. And since we have more students in natural sciences and engineering courses, it’s even more important to have such a course,” Lim explained. While HYU has been the forerunner of performing a field-based education, producing creative talents in the country’s high-tech industries, its founding philosophy, “Love in Truth and in Deed,” is what makes HYU students unique, he said. “I think our graduates have a great reputation, not only for their performance, but for their personality. When I meet CEOs and business leaders, they say our students have unique assets; they are honest and diligent,” he said. Lim Duck-ho ● Lim was named president of Hanyang University in March 2011. He has worked as a professor at the Department of Economics since 1988. He previously served as dean of the Graduate School of Industrial Engineering, Management and Design as well as of the College of Economics and Business Administration at Hanyang. ● Lim also held a number of off-campus positions, including president of the Korean Association for Housing Policy Studies and advisory professor of the Bank of Korea. ● He graduated from HYU with a bachelor’s degree in economics in 1982, and earned his doctoral degree in the same field at Rice University in the United States in 1986.

We may not be aware that a pair of cool basketball shoes your nephew wants for Christmas is armed with a bundle of intellectual property. We may not be aware that your favorite musical that you laughed and cried over last week with your mother or Psy’s “Gangnam Style” and its viral went video is “stylized” with a bundle of intellectual property. We may not be aware that the cold medicine which saved your last night’s sleep is a bundle of intellectual property. Intellectual property is closer to our daily lives than we think and these bundles of intellectual property are created by “the minds of people.” How timely and appropriate that such “minds of people” gather here in Seoul where “creations of the mind” are indeed abundant. The Seoul AIPPI 2012 43rd World Intellectual Property Congress is taking place from Saturday until Tuesday at COEX. Being the world’s oldest global intellectual property association dating back to 1897, the association combines the old tradition with the progressive spirit. And so does Seoul, a city embraced with the enigmatic combination of traditional spirit and progressive edginess. The congress program covers arrays of different current IP issues that stimulate our intellectual minds. The cultural evening program at the historic Bongeunsa temple will offer a peace of mind to participants regardless of their religious belief due to its serene surrounding. And the social networking opportunity offered to 2,000 participants of this conference will surely help the attendees to renew old friendship among colleagues and friends and bind new friendships among working colleagues. I hope that participants will leave this conference not only with sharpened minds along with new and renewed friendships but also with the beautiful mind behind such “creations of the mind.” And for the people who are generous to read my article I hope that they will have a moment to ponder that our daily lives are surrounded with beautiful creations of mind of people including the newspaper you are reading. We create, in fact, creations of the beautiful mind. By Sun R.

Vitamin D supplements don’t prevent colds,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10374252,2012.10.04 10:26,"CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (UPI) -- A randomized controlled trial of people who received a large dose of vitamin D did not have fewer incidence or severity of colds, New Zealand researchers say. Dr. David R. Murdoch of the University of Otago in Christchurch, New Zealand, and colleagues conducted a randomized trial to examine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on incidence and severity of upper respiratory tract infections in healthy adults. The study, conducted from February 2010 to November 2011, included 322 healthy adults. Participants were randomly assigned to receive an initial dose of 200,000 International Units of oral vitamin D3, then 200,000 IU one month later, then 100,000 IU monthly, or placebo administered in an identical dosing regimen for a total of 18 months. The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found there was no statistically significant differences in the number of colds per participant -- an average of 3.7 colds per person in the vitamin D group and 3.8 per person in the placebo group. The duration of symptoms per cold was an average of 12 days for each group. <관련 한글 기사> 비타민D, ’이것’ 예방에 소용 없다 비타민 D를 꾸준히 섭취하는 것이 감기를 예방하는 데 별로 효과가 없는 것으로 나타났다. 뉴질랜드의 데이빗 머독 오타고 대학교 교수와 그의 연구팀은 건강한 성인을 대상으로 비타민 D의 섭취가 호흡기 질환의 빈도와 강도에 영향을 주는가를 알아보기 위하여 실험을 실시했다. 2010년 2월부터 2011년 11월까지 실험한 결과 비타민 D를 섭취한 그룹과 가짜약을 섭취한 그룹간에 통계적으로 유의미한 차이를 보이지 않은 것으로 나타났다. 비타민 D를 섭취한 그룹에서는 한 명당 3.7번의 감기를 앓은 반면 가짜약을 섭취한 그룹에서는 한 명당 3.8번의 감기를 앓았다.

Billboard, an international newsweekly magazine devoted to the music industry, said the 19-year-old singer “affectionately known as the nation’s ‘little sister,’” became a bona fide superstar this year for her “unique charm and undeniable hits.” It said the singer‘s reign began with the release of her comeback single “You and I,” the No. 1 song of Billboard’s K-Pop Hot 100 chart of the past year, which was released in August. “While IU hasn‘t hit the same level of global viral awareness as Psy, her popularity has led to success in Japan, where she celebrated Hot 100 hits with Japanese versions of ’You and I‘ and her single ’Good Day‘,” the magazine said. The list was populated by artists such as Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus and One Direction. (Yonhap News)",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2012/09/19/20120919001245_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Conservationists issue plea to save world’s 100 most threatened species,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10372384,2012.09.13 20:47,"Conservation experts released a list this week of the world’s 100 most threatened species and warned that only a changed public and government mindset could save them from imminent extinction. The list compiled by the Zoological Society of London in a report titled “Priceless or Worthless?” comprised 100 animals, plants and fungi deemed first in line for extinction. “All the species listed are unique and irreplaceable. If they vanish, no amount of money can bring them back,” said the report’s co-author, Ellen Butcher. “If we take immediate action we can give them a fighting chance for survival. But this requires society to support the moral and ethical position that all species have an inherent right to exist,” Butcher said. (Zoological Society of London) The ZSL report was released in Jeju Island in South Korea where some 8,000 government officials, NGOs, scientists and business chiefs from 170 nations are gathered for the World Conservation Congress. Conservationists fear those species included in the list, like the Tarzan’s Chameleon from Madagascar and the Pigmy Three-toed Sloth from Panama, will be allowed to die out because they provide humans with no obvious benefits. While monetizing nature remains a worthwhile necessity for conservationists, the wider value of species on the brink of extinction should not be disregarded, the ZSL report said. “The whole world has become more utilitarian and looking for what nature can do for us,” ZSL’s director of conservation, Jonathan Baillie, told AFP by telephone. “Governments have to step up to the plate and declare whether these species are priceless or worthless; whether we have a right to drive them to extinction,” Baillie said. “If we can’t save the 100 most threatened, what hope is there for the rest of life on the planet?” he added. The Jeju congress, held by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), is taking place against a drumbeat of scientific warnings that a mass extinction looms. In a report issued at the Rio+20 world summit in June, the IUCN said that out of 63,837 species it had assessed, 19,817 run the risk of extinction due to depleted habitat, hunting and climate change. At threat are 41 percent of amphibian species, 33 percent of reef-building corals, 25 percent of mammals, 20 percent of plants and 13 percent of birds, the update of the prestigious “Red List” said. Many are essential for humans, providing food and work and a gene pool for better crops and new medicines, it said. Experts say that only a fraction of Earth’s millions of species, many of them microscopic, have been formally identified. In recent years, biologists have found new species of frogs and birds in tropical forests ― proof that the planet’s full biodiversity is only partly known. U.N. members pledged under the Millennium Development Goals to brake the rate of loss in species by 2010, but fell badly short of the mark. After this failure, they set a “strategic plan for biodiversity” under which they vowed to prevent the extinction of “most known species.” (AFP)",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2012/09/13/20120913001237_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
A bear problem,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10372852,2012.09.13 20:44,"The Asiatic black bear is commonly called moon bear for its large, white crescent-shaped mark on its chest. It is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. (123rf) Korea called on to act on bear farming for bile In July, two bears were shot dead by hunters hired by the police, after they escaped from a farm in Yongin in the outskirts of Seoul. They were among about 100 Asiatic black bears on the farm, locked up in sweltering, cramped steel cages. Three months prior to that, another bear had run away from the farm and faced the same fate. Asiatic black bears, or moon bears, are a globally endangered species. The Korean government has been trying for years to save them from the brink of extinction. Since it started reintroducing the animal into the wild in Jirisan in 2001, the wild bear population is believed to have grown to 27 in Korea. On 56 private firms throughout the country, however, there are over a thousand of them. A bear locked up in a cage in a Chinese farm. (AP) Bear farming is a growing headache for officials in Korea, with both farmers and animal rights groups pressuring them to do something to end an ironic situation. “We have commissioned a study of bear farming in Korea, which should be completed this month. Based on the findings, we will draw up comprehensive measures,” said an official at the Ministry of Environment, which oversees bear farms in Korea. Bear farming started early 1980 in Korea. It was none other than the government which introduced it as a promising new business for livestock farmers. Bears were imported from overseas for reproduction and the extraction of bile, a digestive juice produced by the liver and stored in the gall bladder. Bear bile has been used for thousands of years in Asia to treat fevers, pain, inflammation and many other ailments. A few years later, however, amid growing international and domestic awareness on protection of endangered species, the government banned the imports of the animal. By 1993, exports were also forbidden. Over time, regulations tightened on the slaughtering and sale of bear parts and market demand for bear bile declined, with public awareness on animal cruelty improving. Under current laws, bears on farms can be legally slaughtered once they reach a minimum of 10 years of age for sale of gall bladders and other parts. Yet, slaughtering stopped years ago, due to lack of demand, bear farmers say. “There is nothing we can do with these bears. No market at all,” a farm owner complained in an interview with a local TV network. “I am feeding them, because I can’t just let them starve to death.” They demand the authorities purchase the bears, just like the Vietnamese government did in 2005 to outlaw bear farming. Animal rights groups are also targeting Korea, one of the only two countries in the world that permits bear farming for bile extraction. The other is China, where over 10,000 bears are believed to be on farms. On Jeju this week, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the world’s oldest and largest environmental network, will vote on a motion to urge the Korean government to stop bear farming. If approved, the motion, though not legally binding, will add more pressure on the government to move toward the phase-out. “The (Korean) government has no excuse; it must act now to protect the bears,” said Chris Gee, external affairs manager for the World Society for the Protection of Animals.

Jeju Gotjawal park offers eco-diversity,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10371677,2012.09.11 20:50,"Jeju Gotjawal Provincial Park (JDC) Jeju Gotjawal Provincial Park, slated to open next year, is offering a glimpse into its ecological repository in a bid to drum up domestic and international interest and garner support for its preservation. The Jeju Free International City Development Center said Tuesday the unfinished park would be open to the public for nine days from Sept. 7-15 while the IUCN World Conservation Congress is being held. It is inviting environmental leaders participating in the world’s largest environmental gathering to visit the area, it added. A motion, recognizing the ecological value of gotjawal and calling for its preservation, has been submitted to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the world’s largest environmental network which holds the congress every four years. Gotjawal, which refers to a forest founded on terrain formed by lava flows, covers 109.87 square kilometers, about 6 percent of Jeju Island. It is a source of underground water and home to a wide variety of plants and animals. For example, the Gotjawal area includes some of the Jeju Lava Tubes, which are a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the Dong Baek Dong San (Camelia Forest) wetland, which is on the Ramsar Wetland list. In addition, Gotjawal provides a habitat for 36 species of endangered plants and birds. JDC, together with the Jeju provincial government and the Gotjawal Trust of Jeju, are spending 6.5 billion won ($5.8 million) to turn some 1.5 square kilometers of the gotjawal area in Seogwipo into a provincial park, with information centers and forest trails. According to JDC officials, forest trails are already complete and the first phase of the park development project is expected to be finished this December.

Swedish prince to attend Jeju conference,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10371544,2012.09.09 20:04,"Prince Carl Philip of Sweden will travel to Korea to participate in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature World Conservation Congress in Jeju on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to the Swedish Embassy. Philip will be attending as a patron of the IUCN and will participate in a number of events including the World Leaders’ Dialogue and an award ceremony Saturday. Philip will meet with Korean Minister for Environment Yoo Young-sook on Wednesday. Philip previously visited the IUCN headquarters in Gland, Switzerland, in February, where he met with IUCN director Julia Marton-Lefvre.

Ecuador seeks Korean support for unique habitat,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10372354,2012.09.09 20:00,"A former ambassador spearheading a unique Ecuadorian initiative to protect one of the most bio-diverse places on earth has asked Korea for its support. Speaking at the Ecuadorian Embassy in Seoul on Thursday, Yasuni-ITT Initiative Secretary of State Ivonne Baki expressed her hope that the Korean government and local concerns would support the Ecuadorian government’s proposal to refrain from exploiting oil reserves at Yasuni National Park by contributing to the cost of forgone oil revenues. The initiative proposes leaving reserves worth some $7.2 billion untouched if the international community donates half of the oil’s value. “We are here in because we believe Korea cares very much about the environment but, other than that, also because they care about the people and the future generations and present generations,” said Baki ahead of an appearance at the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Jeju. “We haven’t had any country from Asia (add its support) yet ... and I would like very much for Korea be the first one to do so.” Yasuni-ITT Initiative Secretary of State Ivonne Baki Supporters of the initiative say that leaving the area untouched will save some 1.2 billion metric tons in CO2 emissions, and protect its unique flora and fauna and two uncontacted indigenous tribes. Considered ecologically unique, the national park has more species of trees in one hectare than the entire of North America. “This is the place that has the highest biodiversity because of the geographical position is has,” said Baki. “It is just at the intersection of the equatorial line and Andreas Mountains and, because of that intersection and being a little higher in altitude than the rest of the Amazon, it has never been affected by climate change and that is why is has the highest biodiversity for flora and fauna.” Baki said that, despite much talk, the international community was doing little in the way of concrete action to tackle climate change and protect biodiversity. “Nobody is doing it, and it is about doing it altogether. Especially the developed countries, they are the ones that are contaminating, not the developing countries. But Ecuador took this very ― I call it courageous ― decision to leave Yasuni National Park intact.” The proposal, which has attracted the support of Leonardo Dicaprio and U.N. Sectary General Ban Ki-moon, has so far raised about $200 million. But it has not been without its critics. Baki, however, rejected any suggestion that the plan amounted to extortion, saying it was to the benefit of all humanity, not simply Ecuador. She also said it would be extremely unlikely for the park, which is constitutionally-protected, to be exploited under any circumstances, despite a provision that allows for extraction in the case of a national emergency. “The easy way would be to take the oil or cut the trees and take the money for reforestation (facilitated under the Kyoto Protocol) like what Brazil is doing or other countries are doing. But we are saying we don’t want to cut the trees and we want to be compensated for it. It’s going beyond Kyoto, beyond Red Spruce (the Restore Red Spruce initiative),” she said. Ecuador’s proposal should be seen as a gift to the world, she added. “It is a favor that Ecuador is doing, it is a favor to humanity, it is a gift ... We are not asking, we are not begging. Those who don’t want to give, it’s their problem and they are going to be blamed for not doing something for the earth.” Protecting the planet, she said, is nothing less than a matter of human survival. “This is the only world we have, the only planet we have. If we destroy it, we are not going to destroy the planet, we are going to destroy the humans. To live in harmony with the earth, it has no value, it’s more than the millions you can get.” By John Power ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2012/09/09/20120909000104_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Top conservation group denies praise of four-river project,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10372590,2012.09.07 20:30,"JEJU ― A top official of the International Union for Conservation of Nature on Friday denied the presidential office’s claim that she expressed positive views on Korea’s controversial four-river restoration project. In June, Cheong Wa Dae said that Julia Marton-Lefevre, secretary-general of the world’s largest environmental organization, highly evaluated the river project during a courtesy call on President Lee Myung-bak. “I am afraid I was misquoted,” she told a news conference. She was attending the IUCN’s quadrennial World Conservation Congress on the southern island.

(Yonhap News) “I don’t have a positive or negative opinion about the four rivers project,” She said. “We ― I myself and most at the IUCN ― do not have enough information to have an informed opinion about the project.” The 22 trillion won ($19 billion) project that involves dredging and damming the nation’s four large rivers is the most ambitious and controversial undertaking of Lee, who nears the end of his five-year term in February. While Lee bills it as a “green investment,” many local environmentalists view it as just another major construction project that inflicts significant harm on ecosystems. “The IUCN could provide independent, scientific advice about this and other issues, if our Korean members ask,” she said. Marton-Lefevre added that Lee has indeed made “some brave decisions” about green growth. “We should, and we do, recognize them in general,” she said. Lee in 2008 proclaimed “low-carbon, green growth” as a new national development strategy and has since allotted 2 percent of gross domestic product to related projects. “Conservation of nature and economic development are, and should be, closely linked. You call it green growth here and in some places we call it green economy.” “We’re all learning how to do it.” By Lee Sun-young ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2012/09/07/20120907000636_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Activists cry foul over blocked ...access to WCC,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10372219,2012.09.06 20:54,"JEJU ― Local groups opposing the construction of a naval base on the island of Jeju denounced the government Thursday for denying them access to the IUCN World Conservation Congress, a major gathering of environmental professionals from around the world. Villagers of Gangjeong, a small village on the southern coast of Jeju chosen as the site for the planned base, had sought to set up a booth inside the Jeju Convention Center, where the conference will be held till Sept. 15, but to no avail. “Isn’t it nonsensical that the conference, which is to discuss all sorts of environmental issues around the world, is turning a blind eye to the environmental nightmare that is happening right here in Jeju?” the villagers’ group said. Activists hold a rally on Thursday outside the Jeju Convention Center, where the World Conservation Congress is held, in protest against the Korean government’s ongoing construction of a naval base in Gangjeong, a small coastal village on the southern island. (Yonhap News) At least two foreign environmental activists were denied entry into Korea for their stance supportive of the villagers, they said. They plan to hold a series of events outside the venue to garner global support for their movement. “We demand the government to stop immediately the base construction, which is anti-environmental and is being pushed in an undemocratic way,” they said. Korea’s Defense Ministry refuted the villagers’ claims in a press conference at the WCC media center Thursday. It said the authorities are following due procedures to construct the base, which is essential to bolster the country’s weak maritime security against growing oceanic powers. In July, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Navy, rejecting a complaint filed by villagers asking it to suspend the work. In April, the IUCN issued a statement, saying that the Korean government was not violating any domestic or international laws in its push to build the base. “We trust that the Korean government has complied with all relevant domestic laws in planning and developing this port, as well as international conventions that it has signed,” the International Union for Conservation of Nature said in a statement posted on its website.

Lee upholds green growth,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10370866,2012.09.06 20:54,"JEJU ― President Lee Myung-bak on Thursday sought to promote the concept of green growth to participants of a major environmental meeting in Jeju. Speaking in front of thousands of environmental professionals, government policymakers and businessmen, he said that the country, which in 2008 set green growth as a new national development strategy, is taking efforts to a new level on the belief that “flourishing nature makes people happy.” “The slogan of the WCC is Nature+, which shares a common denominator with green growth in that it aims to strike a balance between conservation of natural resources and their sensible utilization,” he said in his congratulatory remarks during the opening ceremony of the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Jeju. President Lee Myung-bak The Korean leader cited the four rivers restoration project as an example of such efforts. “The (Korean) government has carried out the four rivers restoration project with a view to dealing with such disasters as floods and droughts caused by climate change,” he said. “As a result, the management of water resources has been greatly improved, thereby playing a significant role in overcoming recurring floods and droughts.” The project which entails dredging and damming of the country’s four large rivers is highly controversial domestically even as it nears completion, with some environmentalists calling for an outright reversion of the 22 trillion won project. Lee also said that his government will take measures to conserve and restore the three main “pillars” of the country’s ecosystem. The three areas are the Demilitarized Zone separating South and North Korea; Baekdudaegan, a mountain range that runs most of the length of the Korean Peninsula; and many islands and coastal areas in the waters surrounding the peninsula, he explained.

Conservation forum discusses nature’s role,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10372510,2012.09.06 20:53,"Over 8,000 gather in Jeju for world’s largest environmental event JEJU ― The IUCN World Conservation Congress kicked off its 10-day run on Jeju Island on Thursday, with over 8,000 participants from around the world in attendance. Over 8,600 people have registered for the conference, the largest in history, said the organizer, the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Under the theme “Resilient Nature,” participants will hold discussions on 176 initiatives that include climate change, protection of endangered species and establishing a green economy. The theme suggests that nature may have remedies for the challenges that mankind faces today, such as climate change, poverty and development, organizers said.

(Yonhap News) “Nature is inherently strong, but we must improve how quickly nature and people adapt to change,” Julia Marton-Lefevre, director-general of the IUCN. “If we strengthen nature, we’ll see that ecosystems are more resilient and people, communities and economies are healthier.” Yoo Young-sook, Korea’s environmental minister, hoped that the Jeju conference will be serve as a momentum for countries in Northeast Asia and beyond to seek nature-based solutions to many of the problems they face today. “My hope is that after the conference, nature-based approaches become the talk of the town globally,” she said in a press conference held prior to the opening ceremony. Taking place every four years, the WCC is the largest and one of the most important events for the global environmental community. It is the first time in its more than 60-year history that the congress is being held in Northeast Asia. The WCC consists of two major sections: One is a large forum ― a marketplace of ideas, where participants from all sectors of society exchange ideas and experiences and discuss what needs to be done. The second part is a global environmental parliament where governments and NGOs debate and vote on major issues. The event’s 10-day schedule is packed with numerous discussions, workshops, seminars, roundtables and receptions on a wide range of issues ― some of political importance and others of technical value. One of the special programs is the World Leaders’ Dialogue, in which influential figures ― world leaders, environmental experts and businessmen ― will deliver public lectures and lead discussions on key subjects such as climate change, poverty, green growth, nature and food security and nature conservation. Taking an open format, it is designed to be a platform of thought-provoking, lively debates with the interaction with the general public. For Korea, the Jeju event is a much-desired opportunity to promote its efforts to make Asia’s fourth-largest economy greener. “It is a chance for Korea to introduce to the world the country’s efforts and accomplishments toward green growth,” said Kim Chong-chun, secretary-general of the Korean Organizing Committee. As the host country, Korea is organizing various forums, workshops and seminars on issues concerning Northeast Asia, the country’s past experiences and the ongoing pursuit of a low-carbon, green economy. It proposed 20 motions to the IUCN, reflecting Korea’s environmental issues for the first time, including one proposing establishment of an IUCN Northeast Asia Regional Office in Korea. The motions are to be voted upon at the IUCN general assembly. At the end of the event, the IUCN is expected to adopt the Jeju Declaration, the first of its kind in the union’s history. The declaration suggests green growth as a solution to global nature conservation and environmental challenges, and includes ways to establish the “World Leaders Conservation Forum,” organizers said.

Jeju Congress a moment for change,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10372039,2012.08.30 20:40,"The World Conservation Congress is organized by IUCN, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, every four years and is decidedly a global event in every sense of the word. Its participants come from all parts of the world, the topics of its discussions concern the predicament of the entire planet’s resources, and its messages are aimed at the international community. Having said that many thousands of participants will be in Korea and will no doubt have an opportunity to see the dynamism of the region’s economy and culture but their primary concern will of course be how well everyone in this, as in other regions, is looking after biological diversity and the natural resource on which the future of all regions depends. Both Korea in general and Jeju in particular have old civilizations with long traditions of living in harmony with nature, the subject that lies at the heart of the World Conservation Congress. In just a few decades, Korea has regenerated from scratch a vast forest cover, an achievement that stands unique in the world. Jeju boasts numerous natural and cultural heritage sites. Both the nation and the province have made a major commitment to greening their economies. The significance of this venue for the WCC is of enabling conservationists from all over the world to see for themselves and judge the successes or shortcomings of these initiatives. The significance for the hosts is that they will have access to some of the world’s most knowledgeable experts whose views could be of the greatest value in assessing the results and making any needed corrections. The Congress is just a few days away. Enormous efforts have been made both by the Council and staff of IUCN and by the numerous institutions in the host country and the province of Jeju to make this a highly productive meeting. We certainly have every expectation that this will be the case. Several thousand participants, will be coming from every corner of the world, to meet in several hundred workshops and thousands of smaller encounters, to see numerous exhibits and visual presentations. This cannot be but transformative ― all the people going back to their daily work renewed with energy, fresh ideas and new networks and partnerships. It is my personal hope that this will be the best ever World Conservation Congress ― and with a little goodwill on all sides, I don’t see why it would not be. We have had the best of support and cooperation from the Korean Organizing Committee, and indeed from all levels of government, both in Seoul and Jeju. Even given the very different cultures and expectations of the different parties involved, the preparations for the Congress have been a model of good team work. The Congress theme, Nature+, means that investing in nature gives benefits not just to nature but to all aspects of our lives, including the economy, society, human well-being ― and of course, the climate. Nature+ also means that nature, as a part of all creation has a right to exist simply for itself, not just for what it can do for us humans and our economies. And while pure mathematicians might object, for me Nature+ also means that our small investments in nature get multiplied many times by the tricks she has evolved over the ages to produce so much from so little. WCC is a four-yearly event, with a focused agenda and participants who have come after years of field work and preparation to exchange views and make agreements that most of them basically believe in. There will, of course, be some contentious issues and lots of debates, but at the end of our 10 days in Jeju, we can expect a very large number of agreed resolutions. Of course, the matter of commitments remains more or less the same in both cases since money is a scarce resource. A very large number of initiatives are being discussed and launched at Jeju. Many of these are embodied in the Resolutions that the Congress will pass, though of course the resources needed to implement them may still have to be obtained. The big outcomes of 2012 will be approval of the new programs and approaches that IUCN plans to take to minimize the threats to biodiversity. One of these will be a renewed emphasis on ecosystem management, which needs to be brought up in the Union to the same level as our pioneering work on protected areas and species conservation. The past four years have been very eventful and I have had a wonderful time working with IUCN over this period. As president, my job was to work with the Council to provide policies and guidance to the Union and this I think we did with reasonable impact ―- on the program, on the business approach and on the governance mechanisms. Having been associated with IUCN for some 35 years, it is unlikely that I will completely disappear from its radar screen, but my next few years will take me back to working in the rural economy of my country, India, where I hope that we can eliminate poverty just as was so successfully done in Korea.

Slovak Ambassador Bella commended the event, calling the students and other participants “the future of this planet.” “I am very glad to observe that Daejayon is becoming a driving force of harmonious coexistence of human and nature not only in university areas and campus grounds, but it is also reaching out to local administrations, businesses and the general community.” University students attend an annual environmental forum hosted by Daejayon, a member of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, on the Jukjeon, Gyeonggi Province, campus of Dankook University on Aug. 13. (Daejayon) “My personal ambition is to make Daejayon known not only in my country Slovakia, which is located in the heart of Europe, but also in the whole Central European region,” said Bella. “I cannot wait to see your new ideas and creative efforts be introduced at the 2012 World Conservation Congress,” said Kim Chong-chun, secretary general of the WCC’s Korean Organizing Committee. The annual event was held in order to stir interest in conservation and expand networks as a frontrunner for the World Conservation Congress held by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in September. Also supported by the Gabonese, Slovak and the Ethiopian embassies, the forum was host to university students from many countries, including the University of the Western Cape in South Africa and the Mercu Buana University in Indonesia. Also presenting was Nam Sang-min, an environmental affairs officer at the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. Daejayon, whose name means “great nature” in Korean, runs extensive Green Campus, Green School and Green World projects to raise awareness of the reality of climate change and urge people to take action. First started by university students to carry out cleanup projects ahead of the 2002 World Cup, the organization re-launched on a grander scale in 2008 as the Lee Myung-bak government focused on green growth and sustainable development. Daejayon is now a member of the IUCN and will host campus conservation seminars at the IUCN World Conservation Congress, to be held with organizations from 150 countries on Jeju Island this Sept. 6-15.

‘AFoCO to help drive global green growth’,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10370238,2012.08.12 20:18,"Minister Lee says Korea’s successful forest rehabilitation will be shared through the global organization The establishment of the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization, or AFoCO, was made in accordance with the agreement between the governments of Korea and the member states of Association of Southeast Asian Nations on forest cooperation. Minister Lee Don-koo of the Korea Forest Service expressed that “the milestone of successful rehabilitation of Korea’s degraded land will be shared with the world through AFoCO.” One year after Lee earned worldwide acclaim for the results of the 10th Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification, or UNCCD COP10, he is in the spotlight once again for his initiative to create an international organization to put the vision of “Low Carbon Green Growth” into practice. Lee’s main strategy to achieve “Global Green Growth” centers on the establishment of AFoCO. It was eventually realized through the entry into force of the agreement between ASEAN member states and Korea, which was signed at the 14th ASEAN-Korea Summit on Nov. 18 in Bali, Indonesia. KFS Minister Lee Don-koo AFoCO, which is the first international organization coping with diverse forest issues in Asia, is the epitome of Lee’s firm belief in cross-border cooperation in forestry. An internationally-renowned forestry professor of Seoul National University, a regular member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and president of International Union of Forest Research Organization, or IUFRO, Lee told The Korea Herald that “AFoCO is an international organization that will share the successful achievement of afforestation in Korea and become a driving force of global green growth.” Q: Could you explain the purpose and the schedule of the Special ASEAN-Korea Ministerial Meeting on Forestry, or SMMF, which will be held on Aug. 29-30 in Seoul? A: The SMMF will commemorate the entry into force of the agreement and will celebrate the eventual establishment of the AFoCO Secretariat on Sept. 1. This will be the first time that the ministers responsible for forestry of the ASEAN member states and Korea will gather. It is expected to embrace diverse dialogues that would strengthen the forest cooperation between ASEAN member states and Korea since the meeting includes the Senior Officials Meeting on Forestry and the Special ASEAN- Korea Ministerial Meeting on Forestry. Q: Then, the forestry cooperation with ASEAN member states is likely to be strengthened through the SMMF. What are your expectations from this meeting? A: The agreement, which is a concrete outcome of Korea’s vision of “Low Carbon Green Growth,” was signed last year and came into effect on Aug. 5. In this context, the SMMF is expected to become a platform that facilitates the implementation of the agreement. We hope the importance of international and regional cooperation on forestry is emphasized with the practical cooperation projects that will be initiated in September 2012. There is a ministerial statement titled “Seoul Declaration on Forestry” that is planned to be adopted for long-term forestry cooperation between ASEAN member states and Korea. Q: Is it true that AFoCO will be established in Korea in September for to reinforce forestry cooperation with ASEAN member states? A: Yes, AFoCO will be the first international organization dealing with forest matters in Asia. This organization was first proposed by President Lee Myung-bak at the ASEAN-Korea Commemorative Summit held in June 2009. Subsequently, the agreement was signed at the 14th ASEAN-Korea Summit on Nov. 18, 2011 in Bali, Indonesia, and entered into force on Aug. 5, 2012. AFoCO, a multilateral regional organization, will be a permanent and legally-independent entity based on a binding agreement among Asian countries. Once established in Seoul, the organization will seek to expand its members to Central Asian and Northeast Asian countries during the next two years. Q: AFoCO is viewed as the first international organization dedicated to forestry in Asia. Please tell us about its goals. A: The primary goals of AFoCO include: enhancing regional cooperation in the field of forestry so as to help the member countries build their capacity to cope with and adjust to climate change, desertification and other current and emerging environmental issues in the Asian region; promoting the conservation and utilization of forests and forestry in an environmentally friendly and economically sustainable manner in the Asian countries whose economies are highly dependent on forest resources; and pooling the expertise and technology that Korea has built in the field of forestry to jointly promote green growth in the Asian region. Asian countries including the ASEAN member states have expressed keen interest in Korea’s successful afforestation that paved the way for its rapid economic growth after the 1950-53 Korean War. Some forest-rich nations, like Indonesia, have expressed their intention to emulate Korea’s successful forest management. Q: The KFS has continued to enhance its international relations by building bilateral partnerships with 16 countries. A new chapter will open in the upcoming Special ASEAN- Korea Ministerial Meeting on Forestry, when a new partnership with the Philippines will be launched. Could you elaborate on the purpose of the KFS partnership with the Philippines? A: The KFS has been pushing forward a wide range of cross-border cooperation in forestry with partner countries including Chile and Brazil. Such efforts have led to a variety of cooperative projects aimed at securing wood resources, providing support for forest rehabilitation and preventing desertification and sandstorms in the partner countries. The KFS plans to sign a new memorandum of understanding with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines and also hold a Forest Cooperative Committee Meeting with Vietnam, which will be its the seventh session, during the upcoming Special ASEAN-Korea Ministerial Meeting on Forestry. These countries have high potential for forest resources development in the future. The KFS has set its sights not only on securing wood resources and the biodiversity of Korean forests, which is viewed as an important environmental asset for the future, but also on transferring its research and afforestation technology to other Asian countries for mutual environmental and economic benefits. Q: International cooperation in forestry sector including securing overseas forest resources and coping with environmental issues is expected to become more and more important over the years. Please tell us about the plans on how to deal with this growing importance? A: The KFS has started to expand its international relations with countries in South America as well as Africa. The KFS will strengthen bilateral cooperation with partner countries, reinforce policies on subsidies for the private sector, and provide consulting and relevant investment information to the private sector to encourage overseas forest investment. We will initiate strong “Green Leadership” on global environmental issues by supporting developing countries through mechanisms like the Changwon Initiative and AFoCO. We will share the lessons learnt and experiences of successful forest rehabilitation in Korea and also implement various programs in the areas of climate change and biodiversity conservation, combating desertification, human resources development, and transfer of related technology. The International Affairs Bureau was newly organized in January 2012. The KFS will lead successful international cooperation by developing strong organizational capacity with professional human resources and new initiatives.

"Ostrom, first woman winner of Noble economics prize, dies",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10365466,2012.06.13 20:03,"BLOOMINGTON, Indiana (AP) ― Elinor Ostrom, an Indiana University professor of political science and the first woman to win a Nobel Prize in economics, died Tuesday at age 78. Ostrom died of cancer Tuesday morning at IU Health Bloomington Hospital, university spokesman Steve Hinnefeld said. He said the school was informed of Ostrom’s death by her longtime friend and colleague, Michael McGinnis, a professor of political science at IU. Ostrom shared the 2009 Nobel Prize for economics with Oliver Williamson from the University of California, Berkeley. They were honored for analyzing the rules by which people exercise authority in companies and economic systems. Ostrom had been an Indiana University faculty member since 1965. “Indiana University has lost an irreplaceable and magnificent treasure with the passing of Elinor Ostrom,” IU President Michael McRobbie said in a statement. “Throughout her lifetime, Lin has brought distinction to the university though her groundbreaking work, which received the ultimate recognition in 2009.” Through her research, Ostrom demonstrated how common resources ― forests, fisheries, oil fields or grazing lands ― can be managed successfully by the people who use them, rather than by governments or private companies. “What we have ignored is what citizens can do and the importance of real involvement of the people involved ― versus just having somebody in Washington ... make a rule,” Ostrom said the day her Noble Prize was announced. She said some people had discouraged her from seeking a doctoral degree when she applied for graduate school, but that she loved studying economics. She is survived by her husband, Vincent Ostrom, a retired political science professor with whom she founded IU’s Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis. The university said Ostrom was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in late 2011. Nonetheless, following her diagnosis she traveled to India and Mexico, and taught a graduate seminar, the university said. Ostrom was born and grew up in Los Angeles, and she studied at UCLA. She graduated in three years then worked in the private sector before entering graduate school and receiving master’s and doctoral degree in political science from UCLA. She moved to Indiana when her husband was hired for the political science faculty. She was at first hired by the university, she said, because the political science department needed someone to teach a 7:30 a.m. class.",,iu
Conservation forum boosts Korea’s green drive,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10364231,2012.05.22 19:40,"DMZ among agendas to be discussed at World Conservation Congress in Jeju Environmental problems are indisputably global, but efforts to forge a global response have proven divisive, even polarizing, amid persistent fears of an impact on the economy. The 2012 IUCN World Conservation Congress to be held in Korea later this year will provide a converging point, and hopefully a momentum for a change in thinking, said Lee Hong-koo, former prime minister now leading the country’s preparations for the event. “Environmental meetings in the past have often divided the world into wealthier countries (pushing for strong actions) and developing nations that fear such a move could slow down their economic development,” he said in an interview with The Korea Herald. But there have been some positive changes recently, with countries like Korea coming forward with a new paradigm for economic growth -- green growth, he explained. “There has been a growing awareness globally that it doesn’t have to be a choice between (environment and economic growth),” he said. “With green growth, a country can kill two birds with one stone.” Green growth is a concept that focuses on overhauling economies to synergize development and environmental protection. It envisions a low-carbon, green economy in which investments in alternative energy, resource savings and other environmental sectors are drivers of growth. In 2008, Korea proclaimed green growth as a national development model. “Korea, although a late-comer to the global environmental scene, is getting a lot of attention lately with its push for green growth,” Lee said. Lee Hong-koo, chairman of the Korean Organizing Committee for the 2012 IUCN World Conservation Congress, speaks during a recent interview at his office in central Seoul. (Park Hae-mook/The Korea Herald) The WCC, to be held on Jeju Island Sept. 6-15, will further highlight Korea’s leadership in that field, he added. Held every four years, the WCC is regarded as the largest environmental gathering in the world, bringing together thousands of people from all sectors of society -- governments, non-governmental organizations, United Nations bodies, academia and the business world. Lee, a seasoned politician, diplomat and administrator, took charge of the Korean organizing committee with its inception in February 2011. His goal goes beyond a successful hosting of the event. He wants to make the meeting an opportunity for Korea to play a leadership role in the global environmental field. “The IUCN World Conservation Congress, for the first time in its 64-year history, is coming to this part of the world, away from Europe which has long dominated environmental agendas,” Lee said. During its 10-day run, over 500 forums will take place. As the host nation, Korea has suggested some 70 agenda items that reflect its concerns and those of many developing countries in the region. Among them is the Demilitarized Zone, a 250-kilometer-long and 4-kilometer-wide strip of land that separates the two sides of Korea. Heavily mined and fortified, the area is one of the world’s richest wildlife refuges, with no human activity for over 60 years. “The world, including North Korea, is very interested in the DMZ, which is an environmental treasure trove,” Lee said. He expressed hopes that the communist state, also an IUCN member, would send its delegation to the Jeju congress, to discuss with South Korean members the DMZ and other issues of common interests. The IUCN head office has sent out an official invitation to North Korea. There was no response from the North yet, but Lee was keeping his fingers crossed. Last year, experts from the two Koreas had held a meeting, despite icy overall relations, to discuss a possible volcano eruption on Mount Baekdu, the highest mountain on the Korean Peninsula located near North Korea’s northern border with China, Lee pointed out. “I am feeling positive (about the North’s participation in the congress),” he said. This year’s congress is expected to draw the largest number of participants in IUCN’s history. On top of the main program, which is packed with hundreds of forums and discussion sessions, it will add a variety of fringe events, broadening the congress’ horizons to a new territory. Among those events is the World Leaders’ Dialogue, in which famous business magnates will hold a public lecture on five themes, including climate change and poverty. Two important meetings are to be held on the sidelines of the congress -- a summit of local government heads and another of chief of national park authorities.

The nation’s flag carrier expects its sponsorship for the meeting to be held on Jeju Island from Sept. 6-15 will be an opportunity to promote its efforts to cut carbon emissions. “We are glad to be sponsoring a meaningful global event such as the IUCN World Conservation Congress. We will make every effort to help make it successful and improve Korea’s image as a leader in green technology,” said Woo Kee-hong, senior vice president of Korean Air’s passenger business division. Woo Kee-hong (right), senior vice president of Korean Air’s passenger business, poses with Kim Chong-chun, secretary general of the Korean Organizing Committee for the 2012 IUCN World Conservation Congress, after they signed a sponsorship agreement at the KOC office in Seoul on April 3. (Korean Organizing Committee for the 2012 WCC) Under the sponsorship agreement, the airliner will offer foreign nationals taking part in the meeting airplane tickets at discounted prices. The congress, the world’s largest environmental event taking place every four years, is expected to draw several thousands of participants from across the world. “As a world’s leading airliner, we will also introduce more environmentally friendly activities across the globe,” Woo said. Korean Air is one of earliest participants in the green movement, proclaiming the principle of eco-friendly management in the 1990s. Climate change is a major threat to the aviation industry. Abnormal climate conditions hurt travel and air traffic, while the cost of fuel oil is a major strain on carriers’ finances. The company has been accelerating the drive in recent years, planting trees around the world, buying more fuel-efficient aircraft and encouraging its employees to save energy and conserve nature. Between 2004 and 2011, the company had planted nearly 56,000 trees in Mongolia and about 1 million trees in Kubuchi Desert in China’s Inner Mongolia, where severe desertification is threatening the ecosystem and people’s livelihoods. In 2009, the company has committed to donating $40,000 a year for four years to a project to plant a million trees in Los Angeles, Korean Air’s key destination in North America with the highest population of overseas Koreans. Another key pillar of its green management is the introduction of fuel-efficient and eco-friendly aircraft. Since last June, the aircraft carrier started operating New Generation A380 that carries 35 percent more passengers, while reducing noise and CO2 emissions. It introduced earlier this year two new cargo aircraft ― B747-8F, B777F ― which reduce fuel and carbon emission by 17 percent and 29 percent, respectively.

(Jeju Special Self-Governing Province) On the sidelines of intensive debates and discussions, the participants will have a chance to explore the host island as part of the official excursion program on Sept. 13. A total of 51 tour courses are on offer for the one-day program taking as many as 5,000 of the participants to its lush forests, mountains, beaches and villages. “We’ve selected 51 walking trails for participants of the World Conservation Congress and are now in the process of refurbishing them for international visitors,” said Ko Hyoung-jong, an official at Jeju provincial government. About 19.1 billion won ($16 million) has been set aside for the eco trails, from the development of routes to erection of English signboards, he explained. The 51 courses can be divided into three ― the first group is to explore Jeju’s natural beauty and its world-renowned environmental assets, another focusing on its historical and cultural side and finally some programs aimed at introducing the island’s efforts to go green. Some of the trekking courses take participants to “oreum,” or parasitic volcanic cones that are spread throughout the island. Geomun Oreum is one of the must-sees for eco tourists, designated an UNESCO World Natural Heritage site and Korea’s Natural Monument No. 444. Literally meaning “dark and blackish oreum,” the area emits an eerie and mystical force emanating from the thickly wooded forest inside the crater. Another World Natural Heritage site and one of the most scenic landmarks of Jeju is Seongsan Ilchulbong, or Sunrise Peak.

Many of the world’s environmental treaties such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species began as IUCN initiatives. It was also the IUCN that introduced the phrase “sustainable development” into the international vocabulary in 1978.

A theme that runs throughout the conference is “Resilient Nature,” which suggests that nature may have remedies for the challenges that mankind faces today, such as climate change, poverty and development. “The congress’ slogan, Nature+, captures the fundamental importance of nature and its inherent link to every aspect of our lives,” the IUCN explains. Better use of the inherent robustness of nature leads to healthier natural systems, better results from ecosystem and biodiversity restoration, and healthier people, communities and economies, it says. For Korea, the Jeju congress is a much coveted opportunity to promote its efforts to make Asia’s fourth-largest economy greener. To make the event a success, the country even enacted a special law to support preparations. The upcoming congress looks set to be the biggest in IUCN history with several thousand participants, officials at the Korean Organizing Committee said. The previous congress in Barcelona four years ago drew more than 6,000 people. The Jeju congress will not be just big in attendance. It will showcase a new level of connectivity, accessibility and sustainability, while reaching out to a wider audience through various special programs, the Korean organizers said. “We will have the least possible use of paper and a maximum deployment of green technologies,” said Kim Chong-chun, the committee’s secretary general. One of the special programs is the World Leaders’ Dialogue, in which influential figures will deliver public lectures and lead discussions on five subjects ― climate change, poverty, green growth, nature and food security and nature conservation. Big names confirmed to take part in the session include: Richard Branson, the British business magnate who founded Virgin Group; Marvin Odum, president of Shell Oil Co., a U.S.-based subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell; Bharrat Jagdeo, former president of Guyana; Michael Mack, CEO of Swiss agribusiness giant Syngenta; Jochen Zeitz, chairman and CEO of Puma and chief sustainability officer for luxury brands such as Gucci and Stella McCartney; and Peter Bakker, president of World Business Council for Sustainable Development. From Korea, KT chairman Lee Suk-chae, Environment Minister Yoo Young-sook, former Agriculture Minister Jang Tae-pyoung and Yang Soo-gil, chairman of the Presidential Committee on Green Growth will join the global leaders.

Dynamic shows open Yeosu Expo,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10362652,2012.05.11 20:24,"Big O Show, K-pop, pansori performances adorn opening ceremony of world maritime fair YEOSU, South Jeolla Province -- Multimedia shows and fireworks embroidered the skies above the waters off this southern coastal town Friday evening during the Expo 2012 Yeosu opening ceremony. About 2,400 people including President Lee Myung-bak and Bureau International des Expositions secretary general Vicente Gonzalez Loscertales attended the ceremony on the eve of the official opening of the 93-day world maritime fair. Fireworks fill the skies as the Yeosu Expo celebrates the opening of its three-month run on Friday. (Park Hae-mook/The Korea Herald) Other dignitaries from around the world such as Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, President Ollanta Humala of Peru, Prime Minister Karim Massimov of Kazakhstan, President James Michel of Seychelles and President Anote Tong of Kiribati were also present as well as Korean lawmakers and regional leaders. Over the next three months, 104 countries, 10 international organizations including the U.N., 23 local governments and Korea’s leading companies will take part in the Yeosu Expo. “Together with these participants, the Expo will provide an opportunity to address the challenge of climate change faced by the international community, and propose the ocean as the vision for sustainable development of humankind in the 21st century,” Kang Dong-suk, chairman of the Yeosu Expo organizing committee, said in his welcome remarks. “The organizing committee has made its utmost efforts to prepare exhibitions that will showcase the preciousness and endless possibilities of the ocean, the Expo’s theme.” BIE’s Loscertales thanked the Korean government for its cooperation and “the opportunity to bring to the citizens and the world a better understanding of the oceans and coasts for the benefit of humankind.” “Expo 2012 Yeosu is, through its powerful theme, an urgent call for attention to the oceans and coasts as living entities that support life on the planet,” Loscertales said in his congratulatory speech. “Every field of human activity is touched by the health of maritime resources, and every citizen on this planet can contribute, in a smaller or bigger way, to their preservation.” To match the theme of the Expo “Living Ocean and Coast,” the opening ceremony consisted of various parades and performances ranging from K-pop to traditional music on the waters. The ceremony, themed “Dreaming Ocean,” began with an open concert by a wind orchestra and a choir on the floating stage while dozens of sailboats, yachts and traditional boats paraded on the sea. Video images featuring the life and potential of the ocean were played on the Big O. In the second part of the ceremony, celebrated pansori (Korean traditional narrative singing) artist Ahn Suk-seon and a dance troupe performed “Binari,” a well-wishing song sung during shamanistic rites. Following the Binari performance, the audience blew Korean conch horns together, starting a parade by an 11-meter-tall giant wooden marionette named “Yeonani” and figures resembling sea creatures. Then K-pop singer IU sang the expo theme song “Stories Told by the Sea,” while flag bearers entered the stage with the flags of Korea, the BIE, the Expo and the participating countries. The national anthem of Korea and the BIE were played, followed by speeches by the organizing committee chairman and the BIE secretary general. President Lee announced the opening of the expo, starting a fireworks display and lighting show. The remainder of the opening ceremony was comprised of performances by world-renowned soprano Jo Su-mi, B-boys, dance troupes, musical actors and more K-pop musicians, followed by night multimedia shows. Jo sang the theme song of the Expo’s main weekday show with a choir of children from interracial families. K-pop groups 2NE1 and Big Bang also performed their hit songs. The highlight of the opening ceremony was the Big O Show, in which various images were projected on a circular water screen named “The-O” using lasers and holograms along with fountain shows and fireworks. The Big O Show will be held every night throughout the Expo. The three-hour ceremony was broadcast live by KBS-TV.

Jeju naval base followed law: global body,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10361895,2012.04.30 19:29,"The Korean government is not violating any domestic or international laws in its push to build a naval base on Jeju, an authoritative international environmental group said Monday. “We trust that the Korean government has complied with all relevant domestic laws in planning and developing this port, as well as international conventions that it has signed,” the International Union for Conservation of Nature said in a statement posted on its website. The IUCN, the world’s oldest and largest environmental organization, is to hold a congress on the Korean resort island from Sept. 6-15. The statement came after non-governmental groups demanded Seoul suspend the work, citing environmental reasons. (milaya@heraldm.com)",,iu
Students lead lessons for planet’s future,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10360232,2012.04.04 20:37,"Daejayon fosters environmental leaders to fight against climate change Student Jung Su-jin hopes to be an English translator when she graduates, but on top of her studies, the 23-year-old spends up to 30 hours a week working to safeguard the planet’s future. She is one of more than 2,100 Daejayon members devoted to protecting the planet through the Korea-based environmental NGO. With groups all over the country, and now across the globe, Daejayon students are talking to everyone from environment ministers to elementary school kids to spread their green message. “As I have been working with the environment for four years the most fearful thing for me is people’s indifference. But it can be really touching when these indifferent people can change into the guardians of the environment through the Daejayon meetings,” said Jung, who is currently attending Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. “They come into our forums without smiling faces but when going out they are talking a lot, they are surprised and have a smile on their face. We are touching people’s hearts.” Daejayon, which means “great nature” in Korean, runs extensive Green Campus, Green School and Green World projects to alert people to the reality of climate change and urge them to take action. First started by university students to carry out cleanup projects ahead of the 2002 World Cup, the organization re-launched on a grander scale in 2008 as the Lee Myung-bak government focused in on green growth and sustainable development. Members then visited cities around the world to research and discuss environmental issues ahead of Seoul’s 2009 hosting of the C40 Large Cities Climate Summit. Daejayon members take part in a Green World project in Indonesia last year. (Daejayon) Daejayon is now a member of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and will host campus conservation seminars at the IUCN World Conservation Congress, to be held with organizations from 150 countries on Jeju this Sept. 6-15. “Many Korean agencies were surprised that we became members of the IUCN because they thought that we were just kid students,” Jung said. “Our important goal is fostering the environmental leaders. At first we were students but we knocked on the doors of many professors and academics and even though we are not experts now we are giving seminars ourselves.” And Julia Marton-Lefevre, director general of IUCN said: “Climate change is already damaging many areas of our lives. There are however much bigger impacts from global warming to come which will affect future generations even more than today. “For these reasons it is vital for young people to take on the issue of climate change helping to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions today if we want a better world for tomorrow.” Daejayon members are leading the way, making a film similar to Al Gore’s “An Inconvenient Truth,” and narrating it in Korean and English during screenings for 100s of people around the world. On Korea’s own environmental record, Jung said: “They are doing so many good things, but Seoul City had the honor of being the second most C02 emitting city in 2011, so actually policy is going in different ways. We still think that they are doing their best and taking active steps in the environmental field.” Recycling, reducing, reusing household goods, using public transport and controlling their own consumption are all ways that individuals can do their bit for the planet, she added. And Daejayon members are all motivated in different ways. Hanyang University student Kim Geun-woo said that reading about climate refugees in places including Tuvalu, Fiji, and the Solomon Islands first sparked his interest in green activism. “These countries are sinking and many people are dying because of floods. When I saw that I was really surprised and in fact shocked. I wanted to do something for our green earth, for nature and against climate change. That is why I became a member of Daejayon,” he said. The 20-year-old English education major is already leading environmental projects for elementary and middle school kids, with a recent energy-saving campaign helping one Seoul school cut its energy consumption by 14 percent in just one year. “At first, the school students knew almost nothing about the environment but after they see the Daejayon reports and after our class they really feel moved and their heart changes. After they know their actions really change I think there are so many possibilities,” Kim added. Ahn Hyo-min, an airline services major at Jaeneung College, works as a Daejayon international reporter spending about two hours each day monitoring environmental news and writing articles to warn people about climate change. “When I realized how serious environmental problems were I wanted to join to help stop these problems,” the 21-year-old said. “If a frog falls into hot water, it notices right away. But when the frog is in the water and the water is heating slowly the frog doesn’t recognize the temperature and dies. “Just like this situation, all human beings are getting accustomed to these environmental disasters and are not aware of the seriousness of environmental problems. People are dying now because of the climate change but until now people want better cars, better cellphones and better life they are not thinking about the environment at all. I want to say this is the world’s biggest and most serious problem.” And Jung said that Daejayon members came from all different academic fields were motivated to teach others, especially school students, about threats facing the world. “We are educating them because they are the future university students and future leaders. They are going to face the headwind of climate change,” she said. For more information on Daejayon go to www.greatnature.org.

KBS drama ‘Dream High’ nominated for European award,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10357723,2012.02.29 15:25,"S. Korean drama gets international attention for creativity, K-pop power KUALA LUMPUR ― “Dream High,” a Korean musical drama co-produced and distributed by KBS was nominated on Tuesday in the youth category of Rose d’Or, a global television festival in Switzerland. The Korean drama was the only Asian program out of 36 nominated for one of 12 different categories at the festival in Lucerne, which runs from May 7-10. The drama that portrays the passion and agony of teens dreaming about becoming stars will compete in the festival against BBC’s “Leonardo, Wing and a Prayer,” and “You’re Not a Werewolf” by West German Broadcasting. The BBC show is an action-packed mystery and drama series about a teenage Leonardo da Vinci, while the German program follows a problem-solving Wolfman who gives advice to struggling teens. More than 400 programs from around the world were submitted for nominations. “Recently, Korean dramas as well as K-pop are getting popular not only in Asia but also in Europe and the Americas. I think the jury gave higher marks because the program effectively combined the two power factors,” Cho Dae-hyun, president of KBS Media, told The Korea Herald at the Nominees Night in Kuala Lumpur. Cast of “Dream High” (KBS) KBS programs have been nominated for the Golden Rose Awards since 2006. In 2010, two programs by KBS ― “My Too Perfect Sons” and “The Golden Bell Challenge” ― were nominated. However, none have ever won a prize. Cho said this year will be different because of the growing interest in K-pop all over the world, as well as the quality and creativity of South Korean dramas, which have matured over the years. “The Korean entertainment industry is the one of the most competitive markets in the world. We train actors and singers for many years to create quality dramas as well as entertainment programs. And also we collaborate with world-renowned experts,” Cho said. “I know the Rose d’Or festival is putting more focus on programs from Europe and the Americas and hopefully it also will be the place where more Asian works can be introduced,” he added. “Dream High,” aired in early 2011, was produced by Bae Yong-jun, an actor who achieved pan-Asian fame with hit drama “Winter Sonata.” Bae also starred in the series. The drama features K-pop stars including Taecyeon and Wooyoung from boyband 2PM, Ham Eun-jeong from girl group T-ara and singer IU. It was also partly produced by Park Jin-young, singer and producer for JYP Entertainment. “Dream High,” gained a viewers’ rating of over 20 percent in Korea, and was exported to more than 20 countries in Asia and in Europe, said Cho of KBS Media, a KBS affiliate in charge of both domestic and overseas sales of the broadcaster’s content. The drama drew attention from many Asian TV producers and managers who attended the Rose d’Or’s Nominees Night event in Kuala Lumpur, its first official event in Asia. The Swiss-based festival aims to bring more Asian programs to its annual event. “The answer is simple: Asia’s television market is the second largest in the world and it is growing fast,” said Marc Walder, CEO of Ringier Switzerland and Germany. Ringier Switzerland is the largest media company in the country and the parent company of the Rose d’Or. Founded in 1961 in Montreux, the Rose d’Or Festival is now held in Lucerne, Switzerland, and is one of the world’s most prestigious entertainment television festivals. It has become a platform and a marketplace for TV professionals, producers, managers of private and public TV stations and production companies from all over the world. An international jury of 50 experts selects three nominees in each category. The winners in the 12 categories ― including comedy, sitcom, game show, live event show and TV movie ― and the Best of 2012 will be selected by a final, 10-member jury.

Spain’s dictator-hunting judge tried,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10353547,2012.01.18 18:36,"MADRID (AFP) ― A Spanish judge who gained international attention by pursuing former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet went on trial himself Tuesday, accused of abuse of power in an illegal wiretapping case. Judge Baltasar Garzon appeared in the Supreme Court in Madrid in one of three cases which his defenders say are politically motivated bids to stop him prosecuting crimes dating from the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Garzon, 56, is alleged to have ordered illegal wiretaps in a corruption case involving members of the conservative Popular Party, which returned to power in Spain last month. Garzon “tried to intercept communications of the lawyers with the inmates Francisco Correa and Pablo Crespo,” two of the suspects in the corruption investigation, a court official said, reading out the charges. They accuse him of recording confidential conversations they had with their lawyers in jail. Garzon argues that the wiretaps were justified since the lawyers themselves were implicated in the case. “It is obvious that my interpretation is that the wiretaps could be carried out with judicial authorization,” he told the court. “The prisoners’ calls were intercepted... to prevent the continuation of the criminal activity related to the money laundering,” he added. Most of his testimony was related to procedural issues. The trial is due to last three days. Garzon won international prominence in 1998 by ordering the extradition of Pinochet from Britain for alleged atrocities during Chile’s dictatorship. The judge has also pursued members of the former dictatorship in Argentina. If convicted in the current trial, Garzon would not go to prison but could be suspended from the legal profession for 17 years. In a second case opening January 24 he is prosecuted for ordering an investigation into the disappearance of tens of thousands of people during Spain’s 1936-39 civil war and Franco’s subsequent dictatorship. Garzon is charged with exceeding his powers on the grounds that the alleged crimes were covered by an amnesty agreed after Franco’s death. Garzon argued that the acts were crimes against humanity and not subject to the amnesty. In a third trial, for which the date has not yet been set, the judge ― who has been suspended since May 2010 ― is accused of taking bribes over payments he allegedly received for seminars in New York. In that case, Spain’s biggest bank Santander allegedly made indirect payments to Garzon for the seminars and the judge later shelved a tax lawsuit against the bank. Arriving at court on Tuesday, Garzon smiled as he was applauded by a small crowd of supporters who were held back behind a police line. “They are covering up their crimes by going after Garzon,” read one of the signs held by protestors. Garzon’s supporters argue the cases against him are a politically motivated attempt to stop the judge probing into abuses during Franco’s regime, still a divisive subject more than 35 years after the dictator’s death. Among the protestors outside the court was Gaspar Llamazares, a prominent member of parliament for the left-wing IU party. “We are faced with an act that shames Spanish democracy, justice and the Supreme Court itself ― judging an innocent person for trying to judge Francoism and also for trying to fight corruption,” Llamazares said. “I think the damage is done and the sentence is predetermined.” Actress Pilar Bardem, the mother of Oscar-winning actor Javier Bardem, was also among the protestors. “I am here in support of Garzon because I believe in his innocence, because I believe he is a judge who has done a lot for this country,” she said.",,iu
"‘Dream High’ back, but is it better?",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10353532,2012.01.17 18:57,"Park Jin-young believes that second season will be ‘more complete’ as a work Now that the South Korean drama market has started to jump on board the multi-season series bandwagon, it seems there is no end to the trend. When KBS’ “Dream High” ― a music-and-dance teen drama ― pulled in strong ratings during its winter run a little over a year ago, it should have come as no surprise that the team behind the series would decide to green light a second season. In terms of production, little has changed. Holym ― a joint venture formed by JYP Entertainment and Bae Yong-joon’s agency, Keyeast ― is co-producing the sequel with CJ E&M yet again. Furthermore, JYP Entertainment head Park Jin-young retains both his role as the series’ music and dance director as well as his stint as a teacher (which he played with endearing goofiness) at the art school where “Dream High” is set. At the drama’s press conference Tuesday, Park highlighted the primary difference between the first season and “Dream High 2.” “‘Dream High 1’ was my first time doing it all,” he said, referring to his involvement both behind-the-scenes and onscreen. “But with ‘Dream High 2,’ since I have done it all before, all that experience that I accumulated is a real boon. So, I believe that this series will turn out to be even more finished and complete as a work and I think that viewers can look forward to tuning in.” From left to right: Park Jin-young, Kahi, Choi Yeo-jin and Kim Jung-tae attend the “Dream High 2” press conference Tuesday at the Imperial Palace Hotel in Seoul. (Lee Sang-sub/The Korea Herald) Park revealed that when “Dream High” ended and the option of doing a second season was put on the table he really worried about whether or not he should do it. His primary concern was that young viewers loved the first installment so much that they might be disappointed by the sequel. He also admitted that he had no idea what story to tell with a second season, that is, until autumn rolled around and he found his inspiration. Of his role this time around, Park said, “In ‘Dream High 1’ my character experienced unrequited love. “This time the situation changes a bit,” he said, hinting that his character will be luckier in love in the second season. While Park remains a fixture of the series, the rest of the cast, however, has changed completely. The first installment featured four JYPE singers, including boy band 2PM members Taec-yeon and Woo-young, along with hot property IU. First generation Hallyu star Bae Yong-joon also held a small role in the series. The second installment is rolling out yet another eclectic mish-mash of K-pop idols. Ballad-heavy male group 2AM’s Jeong Jin-woon, T-ara’s Ji-yeon (fellow member Ham Eun-jung starred in the first season), After School’s Kahi and SISTAR’s Hyo-rin will be starring in “Dream High 2.” The entire cast, however, does not hail from the land of K-pop. “Sunny” actress Kang So-ra will be bringing her acting prowess to the series. If the first installment’s premise was about a group of underdogs competing for a chance to become an international pop star, the sequel unfolds on a much larger scale, with the takeover of the art school by a major entertainment company. A flood of top idols enroll at the school, and art school veterans clash with these newcomers, leading to a battle between the two teams. Though the plot and cast have changed, judging from the highlight reel that ran at the drama’s press conference in Seoul on Tuesday, it looks like the second season will retain the glitz, the bubble pop and dance-song heavy allure that made the first season so much fun to watch. “Dream High 2” starts airing Jan. 30 on Monday and Tuesday nights at 9:55 p.m. on KBS 2 TV.

[Meghan Daum] Personhood USA: Zygotes on a slippery slope,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10392550,2011.11.14 19:55,"When I first heard about Personhood USA, I got it confused with Up with People, the organization best known for song-and-dance troupes that go around the world singing songs like “Which Way America?” and “What Color Is God’s Skin?” When I realized it was actually an anti-abortion group devoted to the idea that any fertilized human egg should be considered a person, I still couldn’t shake the image of wholesome young performers spreading fetus love across the globe. Instead of singing about peace and “dances through the ages” they could sing about zygotes and implantation, though admittedly those lyrics might be tough to rhyme. Personhood USA is the force behind Mississippi’s Initiative 26, the ballot measure ― defeated Tuesday by a wide margin ― that sought to amend the Mississippi Constitution so that life would be specifically defined as beginning at conception. If it had passed and been enacted, abortion would have become illegal in all cases. Legal experts and others have pointed out that such a law could ban some forms of birth control and potentially make it a crime to destroy embryos that have been frozen following retrievals for in vitro fertilization. Personhood USA, which says its mission is to “serve Jesus by being an advocate for those who cannot speak for themselves, the pre-born child,” responded to the defeat with a post Wednesday on its website saying its campaign was trounced by “outright lies” that “falsely claimed” the measure would ban in vitro fertilization and contraception and give protections to “ ‘eggs.’” That’s clever wording, because the personhood law as it was written certainly would have banned implantation-preventing contraception (like IUDs and the morning-after pill), and its embryo protections were likely to prevent parents’ discarding unused embryos following IVF procedures. The debate may be over for the moment in Mississippi, but because similar campaigns are underway in other states, the dystopian scenarios will surely rage on. If an embryo (and even its antecedent, a zygote) is a person, could a woman who does something ― anything ― that causes a miscarriage be charged with murder or manslaughter? Could women who learn their fetuses have nonsurvivable birth defects be forced to carry those fetuses to term? And what about the sovereign rights of all people to “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness”? An embryo conceived through IVF that’s destined to sit in a cryobank for all eternity surely isn’t being allowed to pursue happiness. Would wombs have to be secured for each and every one? A lot of this is slippery slope stuff, the kind of nonsense that gets same-sex marriage opponents bellyaching about people marrying their pets. But, oddly enough, for all the hand-wringing around the issue, the personhood nonsense could end up being the best thing to happen to reproductive rights in a long time. Look, the country may be divided on abortion, but we’re still a maniacally pro-natalist culture. We’re obsessed with celebrity baby bumps, with self-righteous parenting advice, with reality star mega-families like the Duggars ― who, as it happens, announced Tuesday that their 20th child is on the way. And it’s this very obsession that will almost certainly render personhood laws largely moot. That’s because the American people, rightly or wrongly, want babies the way they want most things ― on their own terms. They want them even if they’re infertile or post-menopausal or single or part of a same-sex couple. Sure, we adopt, but lots of folks will still do whatever it takes to get their “own” brand new baby, even if means buying the genetic material and renting a womb. For the personhood movement, the irony is that the harder it fights, the more it stands to lose, not just because its slippery slope erodes into a landslide of hyperbole but because it turns out that taking away the right to terminate a pregnancy isn’t the only thing that scares people. More frightening still is taking away the right to initiate a pregnancy when and how we choose to ― including in a laboratory fraught with moral ambiguities. It’s something both sides on this issue appear to hold equally dear. In other words, Personhood USA may indeed be better off as a traveling musical show than a political movement. “Implantation Nation”: Now that could be a catchy tune.

Rhino subspecies vanishing from the wild,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10392416,2011.11.11 14:59,"GENEVA (AP) — The Western Black Rhino of Africa has been declared officially extinct, and two other subspecies of rhinoceros are close to meeting the same fate, a leading conservation group said Thursday. The International Union for Conservation of Nature said a recent reassessment of the Western Black Rhino had led it to declare the species extinct, adding that the Northern White Rhino of central Africa is now ""possibly extinct"" in the wild and the Javan Rhino is ""probably extinct"" in Vietnam, after poachers killed the last animal there in 2010. A small but declining population of the Javan Rhino survives on the Indonesian island of Java, it added. In this file photo provided Jan. 25, 2011, by the Saint Louis Zoo, a black rhinoceros calf born at the zoo on Jan. 14 stays close to his mother, Kati Rain, at the Saint Louis Zoo in Saint Louis. (AP) ""A lack of political support and willpower for conservation efforts in many rhino habitats, international organized crime groups targeting rhinos and increasing illegal demand for rhino horns and commercial poaching are the main threats faced by rhinos,"" the group said in a statement accompanying the latest update of its so-called Red List of endangered species. About a quarter of all mammals are at risk of extinction, IUCN said, adding that some species have been brought back from the brink with successful conservation programs. The Southern White Rhino numbered just 100 animals at the end of the 19th century, but has since flourished and now has a population of over 20,000. The Przewalski's Horse, a type of wild horse from Central Asia, has come back from extinction after a successful breeding program in captivity. The Red List now contains almost 62,000 species of plants and animals, whose status is constantly monitored by conservationists. <한글기사> 야생 검은 코뿔소 결국 멸종 서아프리카의 검은 코뿔소가 야생 상태에서 멸종됐다고 영국 BBC가 세계자연보전연맹(IUCN)의 자료를 인용해 10일 보도했다. 자연과 천연자원을 보호하기 위해 설립된 국제기구인 IUCN은 매년 멸종 위기종 현황을 조사해 멸종위기에 처한 동식물 명단(Red List)를 공개한다. 최근 발표된 명단에 따르면 서아프리카의 검은 코뿔소는 야생 상태에서 멸종됐 음을 의미하는 `자생지 절멸종'으로 분류됐다. 또한 중앙 아리프카에 서식했던 흰 코뿔소 또한 야생 상태에서 멸종 가능성이 높은 것으로 평가됐다. 자바 코뿔소도 거의 사라진 것으로 나타났다. 검은 코뿔소와 흰 코뿔소는 그나마 사육 덕분에 개체수는 증가한 것으로 조사됐 다. 야생 코뿔소는 중국 등 아시아지역에서 뿔이 신경통 등의 치료제로 소문이 나면 서 밀렵이 성행해 매년 많은 수가 희생되고 있다. IUCN은 이와 함께 아프리카 남동쪽 인도양에 있는 생물 다양성의 보고인 마다가 스카르섬의 파충류 가운데 40%가 멸종 위기에 빠진 것으로 조사됐다고 밝혔다. 타르잔 카멜레온, 다리 없는 도마뱀 등도 멸종위기에 처해 새로운 보호구역이 지정됐다고 IUCN은 덧붙였다. 영화 마다가스카에서 동물원을 탈출한 동물들이 찾아갔던 곳으로 등장하는 마다 가스카르섬은 6천500만년전 아프리카 대륙에서 떨어져 나와 동식물이 섬 내에서 진 화해 희귀한 동식물이 많이 서식하는 곳이다. 현존하는 유일한 야생마인 프리왈스키 말(몽골 말)의 경우 지난 1996년 자생지 에서 멸종된 것으로 보고됐으나 사육 프로그램을 통해 야생 상태로 돌아간 개체수가 300두를 넘어선 것으로 나타났다. BBC는 보호 노력에도 불구하고 전세계 포유류의 25%가 멸종 위기에 처해 있다면 서 멸종위기에 처한 동물을 보호하기 위해서는 포획해 사육하는 것이 유일한 희망일 지 모른다고 지적했다.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2011/11/11/20111111000667_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
Disgraced Korean scientist unveils cloned coyotes,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10349894,2011.10.17 16:05,"SEOUL, Oct 17, 2011 (AFP) - Disgraced South Korean stem cell scientist Hwang Woo-Suk unveiled eight cloned coyotes Monday in a project sponsored by a provincial government. Hwang delivered the clones to a wild animal shelter at Pyeongtaek, 50 kilometres (35 miles) south of Seoul, in a ceremony chaired by Gyeonggi province governor Kim Moon-Soo, Kim's office said. Hwang was a national hero until some of his research into creating human stem cells from a cloned embryo was found to be faked. South Korean stem cell scientist Hwang Woo-suk (right) holds one of eight cloned coyotes with Gyeonggi Governor Kim Moon-soo at an animal shelter in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, Monday. (Yonhap) But his work in creating Snuppy, the world's first cloned dog, in 2005 has been verified by experts and authorities. Under a joint project with the province to clone wild animals, Hwang took cells from the skin of a coyote, Kim's office said in a statement. He transplanted their nuclei into a dog's eggs from which the canine nucleus had been removed, it said, adding the first clone was born on June 17. In a Twitter message, the governor praised Hwang for what he called the world's first use of such a technique. ""The cloning of an African wild dog is under way, and we will attempt to clone a mammoth in the future,"" Kim said. South Korean experts have previously cloned animals including a cow, a cat, dogs, a pig and a wolf. The cloned wolf died in 2009. Hwang shot to fame in 2004 when he published a paper in the US journal Science claiming to have created the world's first stem-cell line from a cloned human embryo. But his reputation was tarnished in November 2005 by allegations that he had violated medical ethics by accepting human eggs from his own researchers. In January 2006 an investigative team ruled that his findings were faked and said he had produced no stem cells of any kind. In 2009 Hwang received a two-year suspended sentence for embezzling research funds and ethical lapses in obtaining human eggs. Last December an appeals court reduced the penalty to an 18-month suspended sentence. <한글기사> 황우석복귀.. '공룡복제해 쥬라기공원만든다' 황우석 박사 연구팀이 멸종위기에 처한 코요테 복제에 성공, 복제 코요테 8마리를 경기도에 기증했다. 황우석 수암생명공학연구원 책임연구원은 17일 오전 10시 30분 평택시 진위면에 있는 '경기도 축산위생연구소 야생동물구조센터'에서 김문수 경기지사에게 복제 코요테를 기증했다. 경기도가 기증받은 코요테 8마리는 황 박사 연구팀이 지난 6월 17일 1차 복제에 성공한 암컷 3마리와 2ㆍ3차 복제로 탄생한 수컷 5마리다. 황 박사팀은 코요테의 체세포를 개의 난자에 이식하는 체세포 핵이식방법으로 코요테 복제에 성공했다고 밝혔다. 이종간(異種) 사이의 체세포핵이식 기법을 이용해 코요테를 복제한 것은 세계적으로 처음이라는 것이 황 박사팀의 설명이다. 개과 동물인 코요테는 국제자원보존연맹(IUCN)에서 멸종위기등급 주의단계 동물로 지정돼 있다. 코요테와 같은 개과 동물은 독특한 생리특성상 다른 포유동물에 비해 체외수정,체세포복제 등의 보조생식술이 어려운 것으로 알려져 있다. 황 박사팀은 청주랜드에서 전시ㆍ사육중인 코요테의 피부에서 세포를 채취, 복제용 체세포로 배양했다. 배양된 체세포는 핵을 제거한 개의 난자에 이식, 이종간 복제배아를 만든 후 대리모 개의 자궁에 이식했다. 연구팀은 복제배아이식 후 30일이 지나고 나서 초음파 영상진단 기법으로 복제코요테의 임신사실을 확인했다. 황 박사 팀은 지난 2월 19일 1차 실험을 시작, 4월 22일 개체복원을 하고 57일만인 6월 17일 3마리, 다시 13일만인 6월 30일 5마리의 코요테를 자연분만으로 얻는데 성공했다. 경기도와 수암생명공학연구원은 지난 6월 멸종위기동물 체세포 복제생산에 관한연구협약을 맺고 복제된 코요테 생산은 수암생명공학연구원이, 사육과 분양은 경기도가 맡기로 했다. 이에 따라 황 박사팀이 복제한 코요테는 경기도가 맡아 사육ㆍ분양해 국내는 물론 외국 동물원에 기증하고 코요테 원서식지인 북아메리카에도 방사할 계획이다. 김문수 지사는 ""복제 코요테 생산 성공은 멸종동물 보존과 국내 관광산업 수익증대라는 의미를 지닌다""면서 ""코요테에 이어 아프리카 들개인 리카온 등 멸종위기 동물 복제와 보급에 도전할 생각""이라고 말했다. 황 박사팀은 지난해 12월 리카온 체세포 배양을 시작해 리카온 복제에 도전했으나 올해 6월과 8월 유산으로 실패했고 현재 3차 분만을 시도중이라고 도는 전했다. 경기도는 지난 2009년 8월 수암생명공학연구원과 형질전환 복제돼지 생산을 위한'바이오연구협력 MOU'를 맺고 황 박사팀에 연간 5천여만원 상당의 연구용 돼지와 사료비를 지원해왔다. 이번 복제 코요테 사육에는 연간 1천300여만원의 비용이 들어갈 것으로 경기도는 추산하고 있다. 김용삼 경기도 대변인은 ""황 박사가 '논문 조작' 등의 일로 어려움을 겪을때 경기도가 지원해준 것에 대해 황 박사가 고마워하고 있다""면서 ""이번 코요테 복제를 세계적으로 인정받기 위한 논문 준비가 진행중인 것으로 알고 있다""고 말했다.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2011/10/17/20111017000870_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu
‘Environment crucial even in downturns’,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10348150,2011.09.28 14:06,"Chief of world’s largest environmental network warns on ‘exporting problems’ Dark clouds gathering over the world economy are an ominous sign for environmental conservationists, because when the economy is bad, governments tend to toss environmental issues on the backburner. However, Ashok Khosla, president of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, urges government policymakers around the world to look beyond the current financial crisis and keep a long-term perspective. “The current problem has originated from some banks behaving poorly. But you see, economic crises are happening more and more because of the prices of oil, trade restrictions and the collapse of fisheries and so on,” Khosla said in a recent interview with The Korea Herald. Ashok Khosla, president of the International Union for Conservation of Nature The biggest crisis from the public’s point of view was food prices and shortages, he pointed out, which stemmed from climate change. “It would be a big mistake to pull away from environment amid this trend.” Khosla was here to attend the IUCN Regional Conservation Forum, which opened Tuesday in Songdo, Incheon, for a four-day run. The meeting is a preparatory gathering of IUCN representatives from Asia and the Pacific region to discuss and formulate the agenda for a bigger gathering on Jeju Island in September next year. The IUCN World Conservation Congress is the biggest and the most important event for environmentalists around the world, often linked to an Olympiad because it is held every four years. In next year’s congress, over 10,000 representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations, United Nations agencies, industries and academia are expected to attend. It would be the biggest in the IUCN history, Khosla said. “It is big, not just in terms of the number of people (expected to participate), but because it comes at a time when the world is in real trouble,” he said. The IUCN will do its best to send message to the world, particularly to governments, that we need to take a strategic long-term view on the productive capacity of environmental resources. “After all, they are the only asset we have,” he said. Khosla, noting Korea’s transformation from poverty to economic prosperity, said that the country could do more as a balancer between developed and developing countries on pressing environmental issues as it did within the framework of the Group of 20. “Its desire (to play such a role) is obvious. But whether it has actually succeeded yet or not, I think, is a bit early to tell,” he said. Providing help to poor countries on the use of advanced techniques on environment planning would be good, but what’s more important, and often go neglected, is not exporting the problems of their own making to poor countries, the president said. “Korean growth has been material-intensive. You import steel, metals and a lot of stuff. Despite high forestation rate here, Korea imports almost all the wood it uses,” he said. “That means you use forestation somewhere else. You can’t export your problems for very long, without paying the price,” he said, reminding the country of the Yellow Dust from China that blankets the Korean Peninsula every spring. An Indian native, Khosla was elected president of IUCN in October 2008. The IUCN is the world’s oldest and largest environmental network of governments, NGOs including almost 11,000 volunteer scientists.

Members of the International Union of Conservation of Nature will hold a Regional Conservation Forum at Songdo Convention Center in the western port city from Sept. 27-30, the Korean organizing committee said. The four-day event is a preparatory meeting of representatives from 19 IUCN member countries in Asia and the Pacific region, ahead of the World Conservation Congress. Among the participants in this week’s forum are IUCN President Ashok Khosla and Secretary General Julia Marton-Lefevre. The WCC, held every four years, is often likened to an Olympiad for environmentalists. It is the biggest worldwide event on environment, bringing together thousands of people representing governments, United Nations agencies, business, industry and civil society groups.

Concerned about low vitamin D levels?,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10342623,2011.06.16 18:24,"Whereas vitamin D deficiency has long been recognized as a medical condition, vitamin D “insufficiency” has recently become a concern. Increased attention to this new “syndrome” has led to a substantial increase in testing for vitamin D levels in the blood, and it is expected that several million tests will be performed in the U.S. this year. If you worry about your vitamin D levels or wonder how much vitamin D is right for you, here are some tips. 1. Vitamin D insufficiency is not uncommon. According to a new federal government study released in March by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, about a fourth of U.S. residents are at risk for vitamin D inadequacy and 8 percent are at risk for vitamin D deficiency. An additional 1 percent of Americans have vitamin D levels so high as to be harmful. 2. Age, sex, skin color, sun exposure and fortified milk are factors. Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency is especially likely in older adults because they have decreased ability to make vitamin D and tend to have limited sun exposure. If you are a postmenopausal woman and have a family member who has had osteoporosis, you are at risk for weakened bones and may need to check your vitamin D levels. Dark skin, lack of sunlight and not using fortified milk may often be related to vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency. 3. A simple blood test can reveal your vitamin D levels. Once you are concerned about a low level of vitamin D, you may ask your doctor about having a blood test. It is easy and just a small sample of blood may be needed to show your vitamin D levels. But remember that a blood test for vitamin D is quite new and sometimes your blood sampling needs to be referred to a larger hospital than the usual primary care clinic, and this may cost extra money. 4. Both vitamin D and calcium are essential for bone health. For bone health, vitamin D and calcium go hand in hand. Vitamin D is the director, but the star of the show is calcium because vitamin D must be adequate in your body for calcium to be absorbed from the digestive tract. A low level of vitamin D prevents you from absorbing enough calcium for good bone health even though you have extra calcium intake. That is why dairies fortify their milk with vitamin D. It also explains why many doctors recommend calcium supplements with vitamin D for their patients with weak bones or osteoporosis. 5. The sun dilemma makes it worse. Vitamin D is different from all the other nutrients in that it can be synthesized in your skin with the help of sunlight. This is why we call vitamin D “the sunshine vitamin.” Therefore, vitamin D is not an essential nutrient; given enough time in the sun, people need no vitamin D from foods. Prolonged exposure to sunlight, however, prematurely wrinkles the skin and can cause skin cancer. Being in the sun is essential for both health and mood but there should be a good balance between limited and too much exposure. 6. The RDA for vitamin D has been increased from 400 to 600 IU. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) released in November 2010 a new recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D of 600 IU a day for most healthy adults. The RDA goes up to 800 IU a day for adults age 71 and older. People who are not outdoors much or who live in northern or predominantly cloudy or smoggy areas are advised to drink at least 2 cups of vitamin D-fortified milk a day. A cold glass of milk may refresh as it replenishes vitamin D and other bone-building nutrients. The IOM warns against routine use of high-dose supplements of vitamin D because of concerns about adverse health effects. 7. Consuming salmon may be good for both your heart and vitamin D. Only a few foods ― notably oily fish ― contain vitamin D naturally. Salmon, mackerel and sardines are good sources of vitamin D. The American Heart Association recommends adults consume at least 2 servings of oily fish per week because the high content of omega-3 in these fish can help your heart. By consuming oily fish, you may have good health effects for your heart and vitamin D as well.

"Halting the devastation of the nation’s lakes, rivers",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10337753,2011.03.29 18:11,"S. Korea’s lack of fishing regulations gives free rein to poachers Spring has nearly arrived. Frozen rivers have regained their flow. I tie hundreds of flies, translate piles of Korean language maps and carefully pack the minivan for a weekend of fishing and camping. Then a nagging question comes to mind: Where is my 2011 Republic of Korea fishing license? The unfortunate truth is that South Korea doesn’t issue fishing licenses. Anyone can fish in Korea’s rivers and lakes. There are only a few restrictions at a handful of streams which are rarely enforced. Elsewhere in Korea, it’s legal to harvest and kill as many fish as desired. Some restaurants serving “maeuntang,” a spicy soup made with any variety of freshwater fish, dispatch weekly crews armed with nets and iron crowbars to desolate mountain valleys, displacing large stones from riverbeds and capturing every swimming minnow, trout and snail clinging to life in the fragile alpine ecosystem. There are no rangers on patrol to stop this hideous rape of nature. These actions are unchecked and frequently occur in almost every mountain valley in the nation. The Manchurian trout, National Monument No. 73, is found in areas from the Russian Far East, China, to North Korea, to the species’ southern limit in North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. It grows an average of 8-9 cm per year, until reaching a maximum length of 70 cm. Unfortunately, most Manchurian trout fall prey to fishing nets or habitat loss before reaching sexual maturity in their seventh or eight year of life. Korea’s national monument enjoys little legislative protection from the Korean Department of Fisheries. The only regulations available for view to the public are buried several pages deep at the National Legal Information Center’s website. The few regulations that restrict angling are short moratoriums on a few specific species including the Manchurian trout. The regulations define fishing as prohibited inside national parks and state that capturing these species is prohibited during spawning periods. The rest of the year, it’s open season to slaughter without consequence. As a result, numerous species of mammals, birds, and fish have gone extinct in Korea in the last 50 years, and several more are listed as threatened or endangered by the IUCE Species Program. A particularly interesting Korean language article about restocking an extinct char hit the headlines a few weeks ago. The story explains the disappearance and short-lived return of the white spotted char. The anadromous char has not been spotted since the early 1970s in Korea. People use crowbars to lift rocks in search of minnow. (Insert) National Monument No. 73, the Manchurian Trout. (Matt Awalt/The Korea Herald) For decades, researchers surveying streams in northeastern Gangwon Province have been unable to detect the fish’s existence. Water misappropriation, stream degradation and poaching are factors blamed in the char’s disappearance from Korean streams. In an effort to restore the white-spotted char to streams along Korea’s northeastern coast, ichthyologists in Hwacheon County, Gangwon Province imported 100,000 eggs from a Japanese hatchery last December to a trout hatchery in Gumanri, Hwacheon County, for an artificial production program. Usually reserved for rearing cherry trout, technicians at the Gumanri hatchery aimed to incubate the fertilized eggs before transferring juvenile char into feeding ponds. After spending several months in the feeding ponds at Gumanri, young char were scheduled not to be released back into their native creeks, but instead displayed as a feature attraction at the annual Hwacheon mountain trout festival that purportedly attracts over 1 million visitors, bringing a tremendous amount of tourist revenue to the sleepy town 30 minutes from the DMZ. Unfortunately, the hopes of the festival planners were dashed. Until late March, conservation groups and anglers were optimistic about the hatchery’s chances of success. Last week, a spokesperson from Hwacheon City Hall announced “the hatchery had failed to produce a significant number of juvenile char necessary for moving the program forward.” Hwacheon County officials did not indicate if the hatchery would make a second attempt at artificial reproduction and emphasized that earlier attempts had been “solely for experimental purposes.” One might ask, what was the main purpose: To restore a species or to attract tourist dollars at a wildly popular fishing festival? Recently, as I spent the day hiking in the area, admiring the luxuries of the natural world, I witnessed a disgusting and obscene act. Below in the creek, a group of people were electro-shocking a small pool with a 12 volt automotive battery. A few silvery minnows flopped to the surface. A man shouted as the others grabbed the meager harvest with long-handled nets. Fishing licenses are desperately needed in Korea. The population of Korea greatly exceeds Canada. The landmass of Korea is the rough equivalent of Indiana. Korea’s fisheries are a limited resource that cannot support the current angling pressure. Regulating public access to Korea’s rivers and lakes could generate much needed revenue to low-income rural areas and create jobs within those communities. However, Korea’s lack of a proper licensing system is only a drop in the bucket. James Card, an American journalist who spent over a decade in Korea, wrote, “The natural landscape of South Korea has been largely re-engineered, with nearly every river damned or forced into concrete channels.” Card’s criticism of Korea’s environmental stance is not unwarranted. Several factors include: Construction sites, prone to severe erosion in the monsoon season; storm sewer discharge-surface pollutants flowing directly into rivers; and farmers re-routing creeks into irrigation ditches, leaving barren beds of exposed river rocks. The resulting low-water conditions raise stream temperatures and destroy the habitat for fish and several species of migratory birds that stopover along the Australasian Flyway. Farms also discharge a significant amount of nitrogen-rich fertilizers into Korea’s river systems. The warm, slow-flowing, nitrogen-enriched rivers lead to massive algae blooms causing eutrophic dead zones. The nutrients cause “the takeover of nutrient-rich surface water by phytoplankton or other plants,” as explained by Tulane University’s Elizabeth Carlisle, who also wrote, “If nutrient pollution is not greatly reduced, fish and shellfish may someday be permanently replaced by anaerobic bacteria.” South Korea celebrates Children’s Day on May 5. What will Koreans give to Korea’s future generations: progressive, environmentally-focused policies that outline a transparent framework of legislation to safeguard Korea’s wildlife and watersheds? Or will Korea’s waterways and native species continue to be viewed as prime targets for exploitation?

Secrets of long-running musicals,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10337246,2011.03.21 17:48,"Easy-to-follow story, timely changes and wit are keys to success for small-stage performances No matter how much blockbuster musicals boast of their leading stars, or how low and lewd some small theater shows become in a quest for custom, there remain several decent small-stage musicals that are long-running successes. South Korean original musicals such as: “Finding Kim Jong-wook;” “Sarangun Birultago,” or “Love in the Rain;” “Bbalae,” or “Laundry;” and “While You Were Sleeping,” are some of those still showing in Seoul’s small theaters to have touched audiences’ hearts for a long time. There were hardly any empty seats at Daehangno Art Madang, the theater staging “Finding Kim Jong-wook,” last Thursday. Though this was expected for the much talked-about piece, such a packed theater on a weekday evening was still an impressive sight. Over 360,000 have seen the musical in Seoul as of January 2011, according to its PR agency, Story P. It has been staged over 1,500 times since its premier in June 2006. “Tickets for weekend shows are almost always sold out. On weekdays, an average of about 83 percent of the tickets is sold. Many come to see the play more than once, not just twice or three times but about ten times in some cases,” said Story P’s Song Myeong-hee. The romantic comedy musical tells a bubbly story about a girl who seeks her first love, who she met during a trip to India seven years ago, and a guy who opens a first-love search company after getting fired from his job. Knowing just which buttons to push to make viewers reminisce about their own first loves, the musical soon became something of an archetype for Korean romantic comedy. It was made into a movie, “Finding Mr. Destiny,” in December 2010, starring heartthrob Gong Yoo and actress Im Soo-jeong. An exclusive theater for the play opened in Gangnam in southern Seoul last year. “Everyone has memories about first love, so anyone can easily relate to the story. We see that as one of the reasons why the musical is so loved,” said Song. Indeed, an accessible story is key to becoming a long-running musical, especially in the case of small-stage performances where the audience is very close to the action. It also does the trick for “Love in the Rain,” which has been running for 17 years. The story is about two brothers who meet after being separated for seven years. The brothers, who have contrasting personalities and live totally opposite lives, cannot stand each other but also love each other. A scene from “Love in the Rain.” (MMusical Company) “Keeping the old story is the charm. It is probably because love between family members remains unchanged despite the passage of time ― it was like that 17 years ago and it still is. That is why I keep the story simple, old and the same,” said Oh Eun-hee, writer of the musical at a press call held earlier this month. The musical still draws a good-size audience, perhaps more than the few previous years because this year is the last run. It will end its long journey on May 29 after marking its 4,000th performance somewhere between May 1 and 5. It is, however, still necessary to make some timely changes to the details so that the audiences of today can better relate to the story, Oh said. “For the premier run in 1995, the focus was on deeply moving the audience. They all cried on their way out. After the IMF (Asian financial crisis), I inserted comical bits and sorted out gloomy elements. These days, youth unemployment is such a big issue and young visitors seem to relate well to the character Yoo Miri who gets fired the day after she was hired,” said Oh. For this year’s run, Oh added parodied bits of K-pop group Girls Generation’s hit song “Hoot” and singer IU’s famous “three staged high note” in the song “Good Day.” The plan hit the bull’s-eye ― the audience always breaks into laughter during the scenes. Showbiz insiders note that spicing up the show with witty supporting characters and events is another necessary factor for making a hit musical. In “Finding Kim Jong-wook,” for example, the chameleon-like “multi-man” who transforms into 22 totally different characters during the 110 minute-long show, is the key entertainer. He thrills the audience with his unbelievably quick and perfect transformations ― he disappears and comes back on stage in what seems to be a split second, dressed up, for example, as a happy taxi driver, a weird Korean-Indian tour guide, a materialistic former girlfriend, or a rigid colonel/father. A scene from “Finding Kim Jong-wook.” (Story P) Unexpected events and the showmanship of the actors is what made “Laundry” another long-running musical despite its relatively weighty plot, which centers around issues such as illegal residents, foreign workers and alienation of the disabled. Actors roam among the audience throughout the play, helping onlookers loosen up a little and get familiar with the subject. The audience gets most excited when they are all invited onto the stage during a fan meeting scene and are handed out autographs of the actors. The musical, which started in 2005, has recorded about 200,000 visitors so far. “While You Were Sleeping,” a musical which over 200,000 people watched during its past six-year run, is also known for various events that happen among the audience as well as on-stage during the show. While developing the story to solve a mystery that happens in a Catholic hospital on a Christmas day, the performers deliver letters, roses and autographs to the audience during the performance. “Several long-running little theater musicals which have a well-built story line are contributing to the invigoration of original plays,” said Cho Yong-shin, a musical critic. “Finding Kim Jong-wook” is staged as open run at Daehangno Art Madang in Hyehwa-dong, central Seoul.

Singer Corinne Bailey Rae’s soulful voice wows Koreans,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10337034,2011.03.11 18:41,"Even the polite Koreans’ patience had been running short during the 35-minute wait for Corinne Bailey Rae to appear. When she arrived, though, the British singer-songwriter’s irresistible smile, conversation with the audience and unbeatably soulful voice instantly killed any complaints. Performing her first solo concert in Seoul at Ax Hall on Thursday night, the 32-year-old appeared on stage wearing a black top, loose black pants and thin, flat golden shoes, about 30 minutes after K-pop idol IU sang two songs as the opening act. You could hear grumbles like “why hasn’t the band checked the amps in advance” and “is Corinne at the airport?” among the audience. However, shouting “I love Seoul,” Bailey Rae started off with “Are You Here” and the audience frantically cheered as if nothing that came before had really mattered. Sophisticated and sweet vocals filled the mid-sized concert hall where the floor was packed with people standing. She continued to rule the stage with “Paris Nights / New York Mornings,” “Closer,” “Love’s On It’s Way,” “Till It Happens To You” and “Paper Dolls.” U.K. singer-songwriter Corinne Bailey Rae performs during her solo concert in Seoul on Thursday. (9 Entertainment) The artist received more enthusiastic hurrahs when she performed Bob Marley’s “Is This Love.” At each end of the song, Bailey Rae thanked the audience by saying “Gamsahamnida” (Thank You) with perfect Korean pronunciation. The concert reached its climax when special guest IU made a surprise appearance on stage and joined Bailey Rae to do a duo for the famous song “Put Your Record On.” She immediately moved on to “Like a Star,” her 2005 debut single which brought her international stardom in 2006. Audience members shouted “You are like a star” and “I love you more.” She ended the concert with “The Sea,” but performed two encore songs, “Breathless” and Doris Day’s “Que Sera, Sera.” The sessions ― drums, keyboards, bass and lead guitar ― were not bad but seemed a little bit lacking when it came to fine-tuning the amps and volume adjustments. Bailey Rae has sold 4 million albums worldwide. The artist was nominated for the 2010 Mercury Prize for Album of the Year for “The Sea.” By Kim Yoon-mi (yoonmi@heraldm.com)",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2011/03/11/20110311000528_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,iu

Population density in the capital of Hanoi reached nearly 1,900 people per square km in 2009 and that of Ho Chi Minh City is 3,400 people per square km. The Ministry of Construction is mandated to come up with better ways to provide decent social housing for the growing number of workers, migrants, students and disadvantaged groups. “I believe this (the study trip) will bring some insights for the policy makers, and support them to finalize the national housing development strategy for the next two decades,” Tran Xuan Bach, UN-HABITAT Vietnam project manager said.
