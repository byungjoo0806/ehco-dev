[Today’s K-pop] Seventeen’s Jeonghan to drop solo single,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10401451,2025.01.17 16:36,"Jeonghan of Seventeen will release a solo single on Jan. 27, agency Pledis Entertainment announced Friday. He is to drop “Better Half (Feat. Omoinotake),” delivering his heartfelt appreciation to fans and thanking them for making him a better person. Jeonghan has been fulfilling his mandatory military duty through an alternative program as a social worker since September last year, as the first member of the 13-piece act to do so. Before enlisting, he put out “This Man” as part of a duo with Wonwoo. The album sold over 780,000 copies in the first week, setting a K-pop subunit record. For his upcoming solo effort, the singer collaborated with Japanese trio band Omoinotake, best known for “Ikunokonen.” Meanwhile, Seventeen will begin touring Southeast Asia on Saturday, visiting Bulacan in the Philippines, followed by Singapore, Jakarta in Indonesia and Bangkok. Itzy’s Yeji ready to put out 1st solo album: report Yeji of Itzy is poised to release her first solo album, according to a local media report Friday. She will be the first from the quintet to go solo. JYP Entertainment confirmed that Yeji is preparing for a solo album, but did not give out any additional specifics. Last month, she demonstrated her vocal skills singing on the original soundtrack of drama series “Love Your Enemy.” Her first solo song was “Crown on My Head,” which she wrote for the group’s eighth EP, “Born To Be,” last year. Yeji is the leader of Itzy, which debuted in 2019 with “Dalla Dalla.” The group's latest album was ninth EP “Gold,” which came out in October last year. The mini album fronted by dual focus tracks “Gold” and “Imaginary Friend” ranked No. 60 on the Billboard 200 in the US. BTS’ Jungkook, RM win music video awards Music videos for BTS members won trophies at the 2025 Clio Music Awards, Big Hit Music said Friday. The music video for Jungkook’s solo single “Seven (Feat. Latto)” won the bronze award for direction, while Megan Thee Stallion’s “Neva Play,” featuring RM, was recognized in editing. Jungkook’s “Seven” music video, starring Korean actor Han So-hee, was shortlisted for the grand prize in the film and video category at the prestigious annual award program last year, while the “Neva Play” visuals were among the nominees for the grand prize for animation this year. The former was unveiled in July last year and has amassed over 476 million views on YouTube, while the latter has about 32 million views in four months. Separately, BTS is expected to make a full comeback in the latter half of this year, as all members will be discharged from their military service by June. EXO’s D.O. to drop winter song Doh Kyungsoo, also known as D.O., of EXO surprised fans with news that he will roll out a digital single Friday. The teaser for “Snowfall at Night” included a short blurb: “As the melody plays, time slips through your fingers, and soon you’ll find yourself in a snow-blanketed hometown of yesteryear.” It also displayed an illustration of a boy and a penguin on a sled, hinting at the winter-themed ballad that will be his first seasonal song. His latest solo album was third EP “Blossom” in May last year, which topped iTunes Top Albums charts in 36 regions. In the meantime, Doh stars in “Secret: Untold Melody,” a remake of the Taiwanese film from 2007, which is to premiere in local theaters on Jan. 28. He is also set to star opposite Ji Chang-wook in “The Manipulated,” a drama series adapted from thriller film “Fabricated City.”",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/news/cms/2025/01/17/news-p.v1.20250117.03be8a1db0c445418c37187087a05f17_T1.jpg?type=h&h=240,hansohee
[Beyond the Screen] Indie films losing ground amid shifting cinema trends,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10018999,2024.12.16 15:10,"Actor Lee Dong-hwi, known for his indispensable supporting roles in the mega-hit blockbusters “Extreme Job” (2019) and “The Roundup: Punishment” (2024), recently starred in the independent film “Will We Get Married?,” which opened on Oct. 23. Despite a production budget of approximately 1 billion won, Lee accepted little to no payment for his work. The film’s break-even point (BEP) of 100,000 admissions was high for an indie movie. “I’ve been doing a lot of indie films because many projects struggle to launch due to production costs. By joining these projects, I can help attract investment, create jobs and support films that resonate with people,” Lee said during a promotional event for the film. Lee’s perspective highlights the challenges that indie filmmakers in South Korea face. Shrinking audiences, limited screens Korean Film Council data shows that audiences for local indie and art films reached just 1.14 million in 2023, a mere 40 percent of the pre-pandemic 2019 figures. For indie films, a break-even point of 10,000 admissions is considered strong -- comparable to the 10 million benchmark for commercial films. However, experts argue that 10,000 admissions are insufficient to recoup production costs. Out of the 103 indie and art films released this year as of October, only five surpassed 10,000 admissions: “Picnic,” “Kim Dae Jung Must Not Die,” “The Origin of Miracles,” “Ms. Apocalypse,” and “FAQ.” This is far below the success of foreign art films released during the same period, such as “Anatomy of a Fall"" (100,000), “Dogman” (47,000), and “May December” (32,000). “A 10,000-admissions BEP is symbolic and not financially viable. Indie production costs now range between 300 and 400 million won, requiring a BEP of at least 50,000 admissions to recoup expenses,” said Jo Gye-young, CEO of indie film marketing firm Feel & Film. The number of screens dedicated to indie and art films has dwindled. Currently, only 62 theaters across South Korea specialize in these films, down from 72 in 2019. The closure of historic single-screen venues like Seoul Art Cinema and Daehan Cinema has exacerbated the problem. Multiplex chains, including CGV, have also reduced their commitment to indie films, closing 14 CGV Arthouse locations in recent years. By November, only 25 remained, mostly located in or near Seoul. This limits the number of screenings per film to around 30-35 showings. “Indie films are rarely given prime-time slots or multiple daily screenings, which reduces their exposure,” said Won Seung-hwan, director of Indiespace, South Korea’s first cinema dedicated to indie and art films. According to Won, an indie film released in a theater will get 30-35 screening opportunities. “It simply means that limited screenings mean less audience interaction.” Financial struggles for indie filmmakers Lee Jae-bin, marketing team leader at Pan Cinema, an indie and art film distributor, emphasized that the Korean Film Council (KOFIC) is crucial for the industry’s distribution and production cycle. “Without KOFIC’s support, the system doesn’t function,” Lee said. Pan Cinema’s Oct. 23 release “Heavy Snow,” starring Han So-hee and Han Hae-in, faced significant challenges due to the absence of KOFIC funding. The film applied for a KOFIC subsidy but was denied, forcing a rushed release. KOFIC’s budget for indie film production fell from 11.7 billion won in 2023 to 7 billion won in 2024, and funding for animated films was eliminated. Distribution and marketing subsidies also dropped from 2.2 billion to 1.4 billion won. “Marketing fees alone, which include posters, press conferences, online promotion and event moderation, typically cost 50-100 million won,” Lee explained. “Limited promotion means fewer viewers.” “Heavy Snow” attracted around 4,800 viewers in its first week. Audience preferences and streaming trends The pandemic reshaped how people engage with movies. Professor Noh Cheol-hwan of Myungji University explained that moviegoers are now more selective, prioritizing convenience and cost. “People don’t want to make the wrong choice, so they prefer films that are popular or highly recommended. Streaming has made it easier to watch movies at home, prompting many to question whether a trip to the theater is worth it,” Noh said. “They prefer to save time and money much more aggressively than the generations before. They value their time and money, so they question whether it’s really worth their day to go all the way to the movie theater, buy tickets and popcorn, and spend some 50,000 won on an experience at the cinema.” This shift has led distributors to become more selective in their film choices, focusing on titles that appeal to specific fanbases. “In the past, we imported films with critical acclaim, but now audiences only watch what interests them. Marketing doesn’t guarantee success; people seek out the films they’re drawn to,” said Kim Si-nae, CEO of AUD, a film import and distribution company. Kim pointed to the success of “The Notebook,” which, despite being a 2004 release, attracted 164,000 viewers when it reopened in theaters in October 2024. “This film is seen as a romantic classic with strong word-of-mouth appeal. It shows that people are willing to pay for movies they deem worthwhile, even if they’re older,” Kim said. Adapting and expanding Kim, who has been in the industry for more than 20 years, believes the changes in audience behavior are not temporary. She has begun expanding her business into production, a rare move for a mid-sized distributor. “Large studios may have the resources to endure these challenges, but smaller distributors need to adapt,” Kim said. Kim’s company is currently working on its first production in collaboration with the directors of the 2023 documentary “Kim’s Video,” Ashley Sabin and David Redmon. She hopes to show that creativity and adaptation can open new pathways for the industry. “My goal has always been to bring heartwarming movies to audiences. While there are more ways to watch films now, it’s important to introduce diverse kinds of stories.” South Korea’s cinema industry was impacted significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic not only reduced theater attendance, it also transformed how distributors and production companies operate. The influx of content on streaming platforms and rising production costs have intensified these challenges. The Korea Herald discusses these issues with industry professionals in a two-part series. — Ed.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/12/16/20241216050032_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,hansohee
"'Heavy Snow,' Han So-hee's big screen debut, examines stereotypes of beauty",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3491941,2024.10.11 18:52,"""Heavy Snow,"" exploring a fragile yet beautiful romance budding between two friends, examines societal perceptions faced by those with striking physical beauty. “Heavy Snow” follows aspiring actor Soo-ahn (Han Hae-in) as she falls in love with her beautiful schoolmate, popular teen actor Yoon-seol (Han So-hee). Riding high on its artistic qualities, the film has been invited to a number of domestic and international film festivals, including the Jeonju International Film Festival last year and BFI Flare: London LGBTIQ+ Film Festival this year. ""Heavy Snow,"" which began production in 2019, has drawn attention as it marks the big-screen debut of widely beloved TV star Han So-hee, now 29, in a performance from her early days as an actor. The director of the film said Han So-hee had no second thoughts about making her film debut in a movie with LGBTQ+ themes. ""I think Han So-hee never viewed the fact that 'Heavy Snow' is a queer film as significant; we never discussed it at all,"" director Yun Su-ik said at a press conference in Yongsan, Seoul, Friday. Han So-hee was unable to attend due to personal scheduling conflicts. ""Instead, her focus was on the film's narrative tone and the essence of the characters within 'Heavy Snow,'"" he added. The director explained the film explores the restricted freedom individuals face as a result of their physical beauty. “We often hold specific expectations when we encounter someone beautiful, and tend to view them through the lens of stereotypes,” he said. “These factors can lead to feelings of depression and anxiety, restricting a person's freedom. Through this film, I wanted to throw the question (regarding such phenomenon to the audience).” Han Hae-in, a rising star in the indie film scene, has earned critical acclaim for her roles in ""Birth"" (2023) and ""Vestige"" (2022). She shared that she was drawn to the film by the intriguing qualities of her character, Soo-ahn. “Soo-ahn possesses a quiet inner strength despite her fragility, and such (dichotomy) compelled me to take on her role,” said the 35-year-old actor. “Soo-ahn is not someone who can be defined by a single quality — she reminds me of the ocean. I spent a lot of time thinking about how to give her the essence of the ocean, portraying her as a character who is boundless, impossible to define, and capable of infinite expansion,” added Han. ""Heavy Snow"" releases in local theaters Oct. 23.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/10/11/20241011050640_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,hansohee
'Gyeongseong Creature Season 2': faster and ready to confront past,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3482004,2024.09.25 15:26,"The second season of ""Gyeongseong Creature,"" one of Netflix Korea's largest projects, promises a faster pace as well as an exciting new plot and characters to address viewer comments about the slow pace of the first season, director Jung Dong-yoon said Wednesday. The first season of ""Gyeongseong Creature"" is set in 1945 Gyeongseong, where Chae-ok (Han So-hee) and Tae-sang (Park Seo-jun) uncover secret experiments intended to transform humans into monsters. The series draws heavily on the real-life atrocities of Unit 731, a division of the Imperial Japanese Army infamous for the human experiments it performed in the 1940s. In the show, this is reflected through the Japanese military's experiments to turn Koreans into monsters. In ""Gyeongseong Creature Season 2,"" the story picks up 79 years later, centering around Chae-ok who is now part-monster, part-human and gifted with eternal youth. She encounters Ho-jae (Park), a man who strikingly resembles her former lover, Tae-sang. Along with the entirely new setting, the second season also introduces two new key characters. Lee Moo-saeng portrays Captain Kuroko, leader of a secret agent team working for the company behind the 1945 experiments, while Bae Hyun-sung joins the cast as Seung-jo who, with the ability to use tentacles, is on a hunt for Ho-jae and Chae-ok. The director emphasized that a key difference between the first and second seasons is the pace at which the latter unfolds. “1945 was a difficult year to portray, and I aimed for a more subdued representation of the era (when producing) the first season,” director Jung said during a press conference in Yongsan-gu, Seoul, on Wednesday. ""However, there was a 79-year time jump in season two. Given the series' modern setting, I focused on establishing a greater sense of speed that aligns with the contemporary era, using various elements, including visuals and sound,"" he said. Despite ""Gyeongseong Creature"" having one of the highest-ever production costs for a Korean Netflix original -- reportedly around 70 billion won ($52 million) in total -- the first season received mixed reviews. Responding to the first season's lukewarm reception, Jung said that he carefully reviewed viewer feedback and integrated it into the development of the second season. ""By the time the first season was released, the editing for the second season had already been completed. (However), I watched the public's reactions ... and I felt it was important to take full responsibility and asked to edit the series again,"" said Jung. “I can’t predict how the response will turn out ... (nevertheless), as the director, I focused on incorporating a lot of the feedback into the second season and helping the viewers connect with the series,” he said. Through the ""Gyeongseong Creature"" series, Jung said he wanted to communicate the significance of remembering those who have harmed others. “I believe it’s crucial to reflect on those who caused pain (to others) and to confront them assertively, without bowing our heads. This was the original intention behind creating the drama,"" said Jung. ""Forgiveness and forgetting are not the same, and I wanted to share this perspective with people around the world,” he added. The first episode of ""Gyeongseong Creature Season 2"" will stream on Netflix on Friday.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/09/25/20240925050523_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,hansohee
Netflix's 'The 8 Show' will navigate power structures within small society,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3388233,2024.05.10 15:46,"Ryu Jun-yeol, Bae Sung-woo and star director Han speak about controversies related to private lives Director Han Jae-rim, who helmed numerous hit Korean flicks such as ""The Face Reader"" and ""The King,"" said he aimed to depict the power dynamics that arise when people group together in his latest Netflix original series ""The 8 Show"" -- which re-imagines the popular Korean webtoon ""Money Game"" and its sequel ""Pie Game."" The eight-part thriller series narrates the story of eight financially struggling individuals who take part in a mysterious show called ""The 8 Show."" On the show, the contestants must stay trapped in a building divided into eight floors. Each contestant receives more money the longer they decide to stay trapped. ""'The 8 Show' will explore the depths of human nature, rather than following the story of a heroic protagonist who ventures out to solve problems. Instead of portraying a simple dichotomy of good and evil, the series is more about the formation of power dynamics that arise when a small society is created,"" Han said during a press conference held in Jung-gu, Seoul, Friday. ""The 8 Show"" marks Han's debut as a series director. Han said while directing his first series, he strategically employed cliffhangers and attempted to maintain a rapid narrative pace. ""When audiences come to watch movies, they sit in a theater and make a tacit promise not to stop watching until the movie is over,"" said Han. ""However, you watch a series at home, and at your leisure. Therefore, I thought it was important to keep the series fast-paced and to leave the audience wanting more at the end of each episode. I also capitalized on the long running time of each episode to show each contestant's characters in depth, allowing viewers to pick their favorites based on their preferences,"" he said. Meanwhile, ""The 8 Show"" has been embroiled in a slew of controversies following a recent scandal surrounding a relationship between the series' male lead Ryu Jun-yeol and actor Han So-hee, as well as allegations regarding director Han's romantic relations with Lee Yul-eum, who appears as a participant in the ""The 8 Show."" The series also marks Bae Sung-woo's first appearance as a main character in a series since being suspended from appearing on broadcasting channels such as KBS and MBC. Bae was fined 7 million won ($5,120) for driving under the influence in 2021. ""Unrelated to my intentions, numerous posts emerged on social media about my private life. Instead of addressing each one individually, I deemed it best to maintain silence and endure the criticism,"" said Ryu. ""(Dating and breakups) are personal matters, so I will speak about them again in a place where I can share personal stories,"" said Ryu. Director Han denied the dating rumors involving him and Lee, who is 21 years younger than him. ""Staff may have thought that Lee and I were (in a romantic relationship) by seeing her come to the director's monitor and ask questions. I'm close with the actors here. But (the dating rumors) aren't true,"" said Han. With the press conference marking Bae's first official appearance in public since being charged with a DUI, Bae formally apologized to the public regarding concerns raised about his inclusion as a main cast member in the series. ""This work was made with the sweat and effort of many people, including the director, actors and production team,"" said Bae. ""Although my presence here was a disruption, I worked with the earnest hope that it wouldn't be,"" said Bae. All eight episodes of ""The 8 Show"" will be released on Netflix on May 17.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/05/10/20240510050546_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,hansohee

"Han So-hee, Ryu Joon-yeol part ways 2 weeks after going public with relationship",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3357292,2024.03.31 13:37,"South Korean actors Han So-hee and Ryu Joon-yeol have decided to “go their own ways” after two tumultuous weeks surrounding the stars’ admissions of dating and accusations of impropriety in Ryu dating Han so soon after his breakup from his longtime partner, singer and actor Hyeri. Ryu and Han’s breakup surfaced Saturday night when Han uploaded a 2001 photo of Nicole Kidman that had been taken by paparazzi as she walked out of the court following her divorce from Tom Cruise. The photo has popularly been used to express feelings of freedom and liberation after ending a relationship. Ryu’s agency C-JeS Studio shortly after confirmed “the two have separated.” Han’s agency, 9ato Entertainment, commented to a local media outlet that the two ended their relationship after they “realized that their roles as actors were larger than simply exhausting emotions between the two.” “They promised not to waste energy and emotions on personal stories,” the agency said in explaining the reason behind the breakup. Han’s agency also apologized for “not being able to take care of the artist well,” admitting that Han’s way of communication had been “wrong.” On March 16, Han wrote on her blog that she had started dating Ryu in early 2024 after he had ended his relationship with Hyeri in 2023. The blog post was just a few days after the new lovebirds were spotted at a hotel in Hawaii together. But news reports surfaced that the two had been acquainted since November last year, around the same time Ryu was reported to have ended his seven-year relationship with Hyeri, igniting rumors that Ryu may have “transferred” to Han from Hyeri. A ""transfer"" in terms of dating is used in Korean to describe one moving from one romantic partner to another with no or minimal time between the two relationships, likening the act to switching subway lines or buses on one's daily commute. As accusations grew around Ryu and Han, Han stepped in to actively defend herself and Ryu, saying in a social media post that she’s “not a person who likes someone with a girlfriend, or allows him to like (her) while being a ‘friend,’ or becomes interested and gives meaning to a relationship with someone with a girlfriend.” Han added that she doesn’t “interfere” with other couple’s relationships, although she is a fan of the TV program “Exchange” -- referring to the reality dating show where former couples live in the same house and decide whether they want to get back together or move in with new people. This led Hyeri to officially release a statement that she had not met Ryu again after November – the month in which Han insisted that Ryu and Hyeri broke up. But Hyeri did not specify the time of her split from Ryu. The post has since been removed. Meanwhile, Ryu and Han were recently linked to possible participation in director Han Jae-rim’s new project, “Delusion,” an adaptation of a famous webtoon of the same title.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/03/31/20240331050091_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,hansohee
'Transfer dating': Why dating without gap touches a nerve in Korea,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3353178,2024.03.21 12:34,"Accusation of Ryu Jun-yeol's quick 'transfer' from Hyeri to Han So-hee evokes ill feelings Actors Ryu Jun-yeol and Han So-hee, newly announced lovebirds in the South Korean entertainment scene, recently vowed legal action against a barrage of what they say are malicious comments targeting their romance. In just three months, Han in particular went from being voted ""female celebrity most people want to spend Christmas with"" to losing endorsement deals. The mere accusation of ""hwanseung yeonae"" -- which roughly translates to ""transferring between dating partners"" -- can be damaging to celebrities whose careers depend on the public's affection for them. It was recently reported that Lotte Chilsung Beverage did not renew its marketing partnership with Han after it expired this month, and Nonghyup Bank did the same. Secondhand car sales platform Hey Dealer closed the comment section of its YouTube ad featuring the actor due to malicious comments against her. Fallout concerning Ryu -- the man at the center accused of the ""quick transfer"" -- has yet to significantly materialize beyond harsh online comments. It was reported Wednesday that multiple supporters of Greenpeace Korea have requested the organization drop him as an official ambassador. Greenpeace Korea told local daily Kukmin Ilbo that it is looking into the requests, adding it would ""do our best to find better ways to promote our campaigns.” Yet by nearly all indications, the love life of former media darling Han has led to her suddenly falling out of the public's favor. Actors embroiled in controversy Hwanseung yeonae is loosely defined among South Koreans as moving on from one romantic partner to another with no or minimal time between the relationships, likening the act to transferring between buses or subway trains on one's daily commute. The relatively short period between Ryu's relationship with Han and the termination of his prior relationship with singer and actor Hyeri, reported in November, resulted in the new couple being suspected of the detested form of dating. Last week, Han and Ryu were reported to be spotted at a hotel in Hawaii together, leading them to promptly admit to being in a romantic relationship. But reports have since showed that the two had been acquainted since November of last year, around the same time Ryu was reported to have ended his seven-year relationship with Hyeri. Upon reports of her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend, Hyeri unfollowed Ryu on Instagram and cryptically wrote ""That's funny"" on her page. Han then apparently responded on her own Instagram page, ""That's funny, for me too,"" saying she does not fall for anyone who is dating someone else. Both posts have since been removed. Upon public scrutiny that followed, Han issued an official statement saying that she started dating Ryu early this year, and his relationship with Hyeri had actually ended early last year. She urged the public not to use the word ""hwanseung,"" admitting that she was irked by the accusation. On Monday, Hyeri wrote in an official statement that she and Ryu talked about ""discussing the matter further"" after reports of them going their separate ways emerged in November. She offered an apology for what she said was an emotional response, vowing to be more prudent in her actions and words. While Hyeri did not specify exactly when her relationship with Ryu ended, she added that she did not actually meet with Ryu again after November. By the admissions of both parties, it does not appear that Ryu's relationships with the two women overlapped, although many in the South Korean public still believe he should have taken more time before moving on out of respect for his long-term romantic partner. Why people get offended by 'transfer relationships' Surveys indicate that most South Koreans believe people should take some personal time between romantic relationships -- though the terms of that time and how long it should extend remain elusive. Matchmaking company Duo conducted a survey on 197 men and 215 women, in which 76 percent of respondents agreed that there does ""need to be a gap between romantic relationships."" Of the respondents, 40.3 percent said ""people need time to process their feelings about previous relationship,"" and 22.8 percent cited ""there are manners (for the other person) when breaking up."" When one's former romantic partner immediately started dating another person, 52.9 percent said they suspected hwanseung yeonae. An October survey by matchmaking company Gayeon with 217 men and 111 women showed that 57.1 percent of respondents thought ""I've fallen for another person"" was the worst comment possible in a breakup. It also showed that 35.1 percent thought the other person ""transferring"" to a new relationship was the most baffling situation when breaking up. Being accused of hwanseung yeonae can be detrimental to one's social life as well. A 27-year-old woman surnamed Kang said she once became embroiled in such a complicated relationship while attending university in the US. Her boyfriend had been involved in an on-again, off-again relationship with his previous partner, who had thought they were only on a temporary break. The boyfriend, who thought they were broken up for good, went on to date Kang. The incident led to her friends pointing fingers and casting her out of the social group, accusing her of impropriety. As in the case of Kang, many incidents of hwanseung yeonae occur when two people are not on the same page in their relationship. Han Won-jeong, a manager for Gayeon, explained that much of the friction in a breakup derives from two people having different feelings toward each other. ""When the two people's stance (toward the relationship) is not the same, breaking up can be more difficult. A breakup involving a third party can be more shocking, but it could also lead to him or her letting go more quickly,"" Han said. For many people, the reason they take issue with hwanseung yeonae is that they suspect the foundation for the new relationship had been laid in the ruins of the previous relationship, even if the person did not cheat outright. This, they believe, shows a lack of respect for a person they once claimed to care for. “When my boyfriend starts dating immediately after we’ve broken up, I have to wonder if that relationship hadn’t already been started,” said 32-year-old Kim Hee-won, who experienced what she suspected was a “transfer” on her ex-boyfriend’s part. “When you end a relationship, particularly one that has continued for years, I think it takes some time to recover. Not needing such recovery time leads me to suspect that the relationship wasn’t so devoted after all.”",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/03/21/20240321050519_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,hansohee
"Ryu Joon-yeol, Han So-hee confirm dating since early 2024",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3349806,2024.03.17 14:51,"The admission by South Korean actors Ryu Joon-yeol and Han So-hee Saturday that they have been in a relationship since early this year has led to mixed reactions from the public, with some speculating that Ryu had met Han before breaking up with Hyeri, a popular singer-turned-actor. Ryu and Hyeri starred in the hit 2015 TVN drama “Reply 1988” and began dating in 2017. Han wrote on her blog on Saturday that she started dating Ryu after he had ended his relationship with Hyeri. “The two broke up in early 2023 and the news about their parting first came out in November,” she wrote. In a separate comment, she added that she did not personally hear about the exact date of Ryu's breakup with his ex, but she guessed as much based on an article published in June 2023. At the end of the blog post, Han also wrote that she would like to apologize to Hyeri, regarding the comments she uploaded on her Instagram story. In the story Han uploaded earlier, she said that she’s “not a person who likes someone with a girlfriend, or allows him to like (her) while being a ‘friend,’ or become interested and give meaning to a relationship with someone with a girlfriend.” She added that she doesn’t “interfere” with other couple’s relationships, although she is a fan of the TV program “Exchange” – referring to the reality dating show where former couples live in the same house and decide whether they want to get back together or move in with new people. “It’s very interesting for me as well,” Han also wrote, a sarcastic comment targeting Hyeri, who earlier uploaded a post on her personal social media account which said “it’s very interesting,” after the news came out that Ryu and Han were spotted together in Hawaii. Ryu’s agency C-JeS Studio said in a statement that Ryu and Han met after he broke up with Hyeri. “We would like to ask for your understanding once again as his personal rights have been seriously violated with unnecessary misunderstandings and speculations over the past couple of days just because we did not confirm his relationship status,"" the statement said. The agency also vowed to take legal action against malicious comments and insulting posts. Meanwhile, it had been reported earlier that Ryu and Han were reviewing possible participation in director Han Jae-rim’s new project “Delusion” (direct translation), an adaptation of a famous webtoon of the same title.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/03/17/20240317050088_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,hansohee

Korean stars ditch AirPods for old-school earphones,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3339028,2024.03.04 14:23,"Whether it's a retro trend or just the convenience of not having to charge them in advance, wired earphones are making a comeback. On an episode of YouTube show “Lee Seojin's New York New York"" released last year, actor Jung You-mi was seen using wired headphones, prompting a curious inquiry from fellow actor Lee Seo-jin: ""What is up with your earphones?"" When asked, she explained, ""MZ generations use these."" And she was right, a growing number of millennial and Generation Z Korean celebrities -- roughly those born from the 1980s through the end of the century -- have been seen with wired earphones lately. On Wednesday, actor Han So-hee appeared at Incheon Airport with a white wire dangling from one ear. Similarly, actor Moon Ga-young was spotted with such wires at the airport. Blackpink members Jennie and Rose are also among those embracing the trend, frequently appearing at airports with wired earphones. During her “Inside Blackpink Singer Rose's YSL Bag” interview with Vogue France, Rose took out her wired earphones and said she has been using them because she is “not good at charging things.” Apple swiftly responded to the emerging trend, launching new wired earphones in September last year. Although the tech giant has primarily concentrated on wireless earphones, the release of the iPhone 15 also featured wired EarPods. The company asserted that the new wired earphones boast improved audio and microphone quality in comparison to their previously introduced wireless products.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/03/04/20240304050560_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,hansohee
'Gyeongseong Creature' inadvertently raises historical awareness among viewers around the world,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3312838,2024.01.30 15:02,"While the show's writer and director clearly said that their intention for ""Gyeongseong Creature,"" a Netflix original drama series, was to show how the people of the time lived, the show inadvertently raised awareness about the harrowing history of the Japanese colonization of Korea among viewers around the world. ""Gyeongseong Creature,"" which ended Jan. 5, has enjoyed global success, securing its position on Netflix's global top 10 list in the TV (Non-English) category for five consecutive weeks, from Dec. 18 to Jan. 14. ""Gyeongseong Creature"" tells of characters who embark on a quest for survival in 1945 during the Japanese colonial era. Through the language of metaphor, the drama series incorporates the acts of Unit 731, a unit of the Imperial Japanese Army that engaged in human experimentation during the 1940s, into the plot, with the story of the Japanese military that conducts experiments to turn Koreans into monsters. Regarding the historical theme of the series, international viewers whose countries had been occupied by the Japanese military during World War II said that the content reminded them of their country's history. ""Though I didn't personally live through the era, we know that Japanese imperialists brutally exploited and enslaved the Vietnamese people during the colonial period. The fact that 'Gyeongseong Creature' portrayed that time of history on a globally popular platform by symbolically comparing the acts to turning humans to 'monsters' reminded me of the history I learned about my ancestors -- and I was gratified for the opportunity,"" said Cais Nguyen, a Vietnamese American college student living in New York. Vietnam was colonized by the Japanese military after Japan invaded French Indochina in 1940. ""Victims of the Japanese colonial era are all over the globe. I think the fact that contents are reminding the descendants about their ancestors' hardships is very helpful,"" she said. ""Even though I know the drama series was made in Korea, I wish the drama series also touched upon the Japanese military's evil acts all over the world, since the work is being released on Netflix, and starring influential figures like Han So-hee. The story could have resonated with more international fans,"" said Farah Megat, a Malaysian American student. Malaya was occupied by the Japanese from 1941 to 1945, following the onset of the Pacific War. Japanese audience also echoed the view that ""Gyeongseong Creature"" serves to spread historical lessons. ""The drama series achieved empathy from the audience that treating people unequally and with disrespect is unpleasant and horrifying. I hope that those who have seen this work felt that, and that this work becomes an opportunity for such practices to disappear from the world in the future,"" said a Japanese viewer on Filmarks, a popular online Japanese film review site, in the review section for ""Gyeongseong Creature."" However, there was also a number of reviews from Japanese fans that criticized the drama series for imposing a one-sided, negative image of Japan. ""I cannot support productions that depict a specific country as evil and plant a fixed image,"" one review read. ""I understand that Japan occupied other countries, but sometimes, when dramas set in this era portray Japanese people negatively, it feels like they are intentionally provoking anti-Japanese sentiment,"" added another review on Filmarks. Media experts said that dramas and films could be a double-edged sword in terms of delivering historical messages. ""Some Japanese who have seen the drama series express the opinion that they want to learn more about Japan's history, such as its colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula and Unit 731, which they did not extensively study about in school,"" said a media industry official based in Japan on condition of anonymity. ""However, the majority of Japanese tend to perceive historical issues in dramas as fiction or consider them as elements that heighten tension in the plot by invoking anti-Japanese sentiment. They often view these portrayals as 'anti-Japanese propaganda' within South Korea, and, (as such,) there are certain limits on using dramas for historical education,"" she added.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/01/30/20240130000580_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,hansohee
[Dr. Joannes Ekaprasetya Tandjung] Let creativity be core of Indonesia-Korea relations,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3302317,2024.01.16 05:30,"“If there is one thing that unites us, it is our never-ending creativity. The world salutes the power of individuals to remain creative, to put forward our most thought-provoking ideas and turn those ideas into real events and sellable products,” Gandi Sulistiyanto, Indonesia’s ambassador to South Korea, said at the opening of the Korea-Indonesia Cooperation Forum in Jakarta on Nov. 30 last year. Launched by The Korea Herald CEO Choi Jin-young, the Korea-Indonesia Cooperation Forum was convened to mark the 50th anniversary of bilateral relations, under the theme of ""I-Wave and K-Wave, Together for the Future.” Over the past five decades, the two countries have enhanced their economic and business partnership. The trade volume has surged from $185 million in 1973 to $26 billion in 2022. President Joko Widodo inaugurated Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Indonesia in Cikarang in March 2022, as the largest Hyundai factory to be built in the region. The establishment of the factory is in line with the Indonesian government’s ecosystem of electric vehicle creation. Yet, is there a target for creating an ecosystem in the creative industries? Since the turn of the 21st century, South Korean pop culture has grown in prominence to become a major export driver in entertainment, music, TV and cinema, strengthening its soft power and cultural diplomacy in addition to economic gains. On Netflix, a string of original Korean-produced content such as “Squid Game” and the recently premiered “Gyeongseong Creature” have become huge hits. In a recent poll targeted at Generation Z in US and Europe, Park Seo-jun and Han So-hee, the stars of ""Gyeongseong Creature,"" are better known to them than Taylor Swift and Joe Jonas. On Jan. 5, South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism announced that the Korean content industry's revenue hit an all-time high at 150 trillion won ($114 billion) in 2022, up 9.4 percent from 137.5 trillion won in 2021. This growth rate far outpaced the country's overall industry growth of 3.3 percent, the ministry said, citing figures from Statistics Korea. The content industry's exports reached $13.24 billion in 2023, a 6.3 percent rise from the previous year's $12.45 billion, according to a 2022 study on the cultural content industry conducted by the Culture Ministry. The content industry in South Korea encompasses 11 different sectors, including publishing, music, games, broadcasting, film and animation, that create and deliver copyrighted works to the public. In Indonesia, the creative economy comprises 17 subsectors, including fashion, film, culinary, crafts, animation and the performing arts. As early as 2015, within a year of taking office, President of the Republic of Indonesia Joko Widodo declared that the creative economy had to serve as the backbone of the Indonesian economic environment. A memorandum of understanding on the creative economy was signed during President Widodo’s visit to Korea in 2018. In early January 2022, as he began his tenure in Seoul, Sulistiyanto, a self-taught business leader turned ambassador, initiated a division focusing on developing the creative and digital economies, startups and public diplomacy. While trade and investment are important, creative and digital industries are equally essential and therefore must be pursued further. The division has thrived ever since. To name a few achievements, the signing of the Tourism and Creative Economy Memorandum of Understanding between the province of North Sulawesi and Jeju Air in 2022 led to the first Jeju Air flight to Sam Ratulangi airport in Manado on May 24, 2023, a collaboration between BINhouse and Jinju Silk Foundation to create Hanbok Batik, or Hantik, the appointment of Dita Karang and the launch of the Ioniq 5 electric vehicle with Indonesian Batik in GIIAS 2023. Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, in her video message to mark the golden jubilee of diplomatic relations in 2023, said, “Today, Indonesia and Korea are more than just close friends. We are special strategic partners. This half century celebration is our momentum to further strengthen our partnership.” In line with Marsudi’s words, let us seize this momentum. Arts and culture should not be seen merely as decorative parts of diplomacy. The creative economy should not be placed on the sidelines any longer in Indonesia-Korea bilateral relations. Creativity should be placed at center stage, as Indonesia and Korea are now embarking on their journey beyond 50 years and toward 100 years of diplomatic relations. In 2045, both countries will celebrate the centenary of their nations’ independence. The I-Wave and K-Wave Forum therefore should not be a one-time-only forum -- or a one-hit wonder, in the language of the music industry. The forum should be a sound reminder to each of us that the wheels of the creative economy cannot and must not be stopped. The wheels will move forward whether countries or communities are ready or not. Therefore, the greater goal of cooperation between Korea and Indonesia should enable younger generations in Indonesia to enroll in excellent universities and receive world-class education in all fields, including arts and cultural studies. At the end of the day, the target should not only be about the ecosystem of electric vehicles, regardless of the significant investment. If the ultimate goal is to enhance quality of life, then Indonesians and Koreans should work hand-in-hand to create an ecosystem of the creative and digital industry, from upstream to downstream, where education also plays a central role. Dr. Joannes Ekaprasetya Tandjung Dr. Joannes Ekaprasetya Tandjung is a career diplomat with more than two decades of service in Indonesia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

'Gyeongseong Creature' spin-off webtoon to be released,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3296258,2024.01.05 16:04,"Kakao Entertainment, a content arm under Korea’s IT giant Kakao Corp., said Friday that a spin-off webtoon series of the Netflix original ""Gyeongseong Creature"" will be released on Kakao Webtoon and KakaoPage starting Jan. 20. Netflix's 10-part thriller drama ""Gyeongseong Creature"" centers around the stories of Jang Tae-sang (Park Seo-jun) and Yoon Chae-ok (Han So-hee), who infiltrate a hospital in the city of Gyeongseong (now Seoul) in 1945 -- where human experiments are held to turn people into monsters. The spin-off webtoon series, set against the backdrop of Manwoldo, where another human experiment took place, will narrate the story of Geum-ran, who, instead of turning into a monster through the same experiment, transforms into a powerful being with human intelligence. The official English title for the spin-off webtoon series is ""Gyeongseong Creature : The Unwithering Flower."" ""A new narrative is depicted with a focus on different characters within a connected universe, and the appearance of characters (in the webtoon series) like Chae-ok and Gato (from the Netflix drama series) creates an intersecting plot point, enriching and completing the narrative in a more intricate, deeper manner,"" said an official from Kakao Entertainment. After its domestic launch on Jan. 20, ""Gyeongseong Creature : The Unwithering Flower"" is scheduled to be released in North America, Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia through Kakao Entertainment's global webtoon platforms such as Tapas and Kakao Webtoon Thailand, but specific release dates have not been confirmed, according to Kakao Entertainment. ""Kakao Entertainment plans to actively strengthen its global IP competitiveness, by not only turning webtoon and web novels like 'Moving,' 'The Uncanny Counter,' and 'The Bequeathed' into visual content, but also by putting in continuous and proactive efforts to strengthen its IP value chain cases where stories and the media are connected, like 'Gyeongseong Creature,' 'Business Proposal' and 'Not Others,'"" said the Kakao Entertainment official.

[Herald Review] Monster horror series 'Gyeongseong Creature' disappoints,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3291063,2023.12.27 15:36,"Touted as the most anticipated Netflix original Korean drama series of the second half of the year, ""Gyeongseong Creature,"" the latest work of director Jung Dong-yoon, fell flat upon its release. Set against the backdrop of Gyeongseong, today's Seoul, in 1945, ""Gyeongseong Creature"" is a 10-part thriller drama that centers around the stories of two individuals who encounter monsters in a mysterious hospital. While the series proclaimed itself as a monster horror series, the computer graphics for the creatures left much to be desired, especially under a whopping 70 billion won ($54 million) production price tag. The CG quality in ""Gyeongseong Creature"" is even more glaring when compared to that of ""Sweet Home,"" a popular monster horror series. Studio Dragon created the CG for both series. Viewers may also find it difficult to immerse themselves in the drama as the characters mix the language and speech style that was prevalent in Korea during the Japanese colonial period with modern Korean language and slang. Perhaps the most problematic of all is the drama series' implausible and slow-paced plot. The romance between the main protagonists played by Park Seo-joon and Han So-hee, one of the integral events in the drama moving the plot forward, is unconvincing and rushed. Each episode is flooded with intentionally slowed scenes that drag the plot and running time. There was much excitement for the latest work by Jung who helmed tvN's romance drama ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" and SBS' sports drama ""Stove League."" He paired up with famed screenwriter Kang Eun-kyung, who was responsible for numerous hit Korean drama series including SBS' ""Dr. Romantic"" trilogy, MBC's ""Gu Family Book"" and KBS' ""Bread, Love and Dreams."" The unique combination of the popular monster horror and historical drama genres, and casting of popular actors such as Park, Han, Claudia Kim and Wi Ha-joon, only added to the anticipated frenzy. Even with the release date strategically scheduled over the holiday season to attract the maximum audience, ""Gyeongseong Creature"" has drawn mostly mixed reviews online. The first season of ""Gyeongseong Creature,"" or the first seven episodes, is streaming on Netflix.

"Park Seo-joon, Han So-hee drawn to period monster genre of ‘Gyeongseong Creature’",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3285753,2023.12.19 14:34,"South Korean acting all-stars Park Seo-joon and Han So-hee were drawn in by the unique background and genre of “Gyeongseong Creature"" in joining Netflix's upcoming creature feature series, the duo said Tuesday. Directed by Jung Dong-yoon of the hit baseball drama “Stove League” (2019) and written by Kang Eun-kyung of the “Dr. Romantic” series, “Gyeongseong Creature” revolves around a young man and woman in Gyeongseong, today's Seoul, in the spring of 1945 who discover the secret of Ongseong Hospital. “I had an expectation coming from the title itself. It is a combination of a period drama and a creature genre, but at the same time, it doesn't miss out on the intimate story of a young man and a woman. It’s a complex genre project,” Park told reporters during a press conference held in Yongsan, Seoul, Tuesday. Park said he also wanted to challenge himself to show a different style of acting through Tae-sang, his character. Tae-sang is the head of marketplace Golden Jade House, and is the wealthiest and the most well-connected person in Gyeongseong. He is someone who puts money before justice. That is until he meets Chae-ok (Han So-hee) and everything changes. “Besides focusing on showing good acting, I also put a special focus on the overall look because that decides the series’ first impression,” Park said. Han So-hee, who starred in the 2021 Netflix hit “My Name,” said she was attracted to the period drama setting of Gyeongseong in 1945. “I thought about what this creature genre series can give me (in terms of my acting career) and I was attracted to this genre,” Han told reporters. Her character, Chae-ok, is a famous bounty hunter who tracks down missing people, one of whom is her mother. She coincidentally encounters Tae-sang in Gyeongseong. Han said Chae-ok’s calmness and agile survival skills gained from her childhood spent roaming across Manchuria and Shanghai with her father in search of her mother have little in common with her. “I’m not a relaxed person. So I worried (about acting the role of Chae-ok) but I tried to remind myself that Chae-ok has a clear purpose in her life and is less influenced by her surroundings, whereas Tae-sang is a character who is swayed by the surroundings as well as the background -- he is a well-off man,” said Han. Others in the cast include Claudia Kim who plays Maeda, the wife of a powerful official in Gyeongseong during the Japanese colonial period. “Squid Game” star Wi Ha-jun plays Jun-taek, Tae-sang's best friend. The first seven episodes, which fall under part 1, will be unveiled on Dec. 22 on Netflix. The last three episodes, which fall under part 2, will be released on Jan. 5.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/12/19/20231219000564_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,hansohee
"‘Gyeongseong Creature’ to lead year-end, New Year drama releases",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3256713,2023.11.12 14:06,"Netflix Korea on Sunday confirmed the premiere of the highly anticipated horror thriller, “Gyeongseong Creature,” in December. The series will be split into two different parts, with the first seven episodes being presented as “Gyeongseong Creature Part 1,” and the remaining three episodes scheduled to be released Jan. 5. With a star-studded lineup in terms of both its creators and cast, the thriller-action series is regarded as one of the year's must-see projects. Helmed by director Jung Dong-yoon, who was behind the 2019 mega-hit Korean TV drama “Hot Stove League,” and “Dr. Romantic” (2016-2023) screenwriter Kang Eun-kyung, “Gyeongseong Creature” takes viewers back to the spring of 1945, one of South Korea’s darkest hours. Set during the Japanese colonial period, the thriller series tells the stories of two young individuals fighting to survive against bizarre creatures born out of human greed. Actor Park Seo-joon, who rose to stardom with “Fight for My Way” (2017), “What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim” (2018), “Itaewon Class” (2020) and most recently ""The Marvels"" released last week, plays a wealthy entrepreneur, Jang Tae-sang. Though Tae-sang is a man who prioritizes money above all else, his principles are called into question after meeting Yoon Chae-ok, a sleuth renowned for her ability to track down anyone, even those who are dead. Actress Han So-hee, who made her Netflix debut with “My Name” in 2021, stars as Chae-ok in “Gyeongseong Creature.” Local drama fans shared their excitement about seeing two of their beloved stars perform together for the first time. Veteran actors, including Kim Hae-sook of “Hospital Playlist” (2020), Claudia Kim of “Avengers: Age of Ultron” (2015) and “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” (2018), Cho Han-cheul of “Reborn Rich” (2022) and “Squid Game” star Wi Ha-jun, will co-star in the show, unleashing a series of surreal monster stories set in Seoul in 1945. Unlike many other Netflix projects, for which a plan to expand the series is made after the release of the original, ""Gyeongseong Creature"" announced the launch of the series' second season in November 2022, well ahead of the premiere of the first season, evidence of the streaming service's confidence in the show. “Gyeongseong Creature Part 1” will be released on Dec. 22.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/11/12/20231112000075_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,hansohee
"Kakao Entertainment Set to Captivate Audience Worldwide with Highly Anticipated Titles including ""Song of the Bandits,"" ""The Worst of Evil,"" ""Castaway Diva,"" and ""Gyeongseong Creature.""",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3201187,2023.08.29 00:11,"SEOUL, South Korea, Aug, 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Kakao Entertainment continues to solidify its position as a global production studio for Korean content with a rich lineup of shows to be released in the second half of 2023. Following last year's global mega hits such as Business Proposal, Hunt, and Narco-Saints, the diverse array of titles to be released this year demonstrate the company's outstanding production capacity. Prioritizing the creators' autonomy, Kakao Entertainment has built a solid multi-studio system which not only enables individual production houses to unleash their full creative potential, but also leverages organic synergy among them. Kakao Entertainment's upcoming lineup includes adaptations of its original stories to creative shows that target global audiences and will cover a variety of screen platforms including streaming, TV, and films. In line with this goal, the TV dramas Not Others and The First Responders Season 2, as well as the film Concrete Utopia launched off to a good start with impressive viewership. Not Others was produced by Kakao Entertainment's production subsidiary Baram Pictures in collaboration with Arc Media. This drama is an adaptation of a popular webtoon of the same name, similar to Business Proposal that created synergy between each business last year. The series tells the story of a careless mother and her cool-headed daughter who live together and bicker about everything because they never see eye to eye, all the while portraying the underlying love in their relationship. Since its debut in July, the drama enjoyed rave reviews and increased viewership ratings. The First Responders Season 2 was produced by Kakao Entertainment's Mega Monster in cooperation with Studio S. Building on the huge success of Season 1 last year, Season 2 is enjoying great popularity as it delivers a richer story by adding forensic analysts in the mix of police officers and firefighters. BH Entertainment, which has expanded its business into content production, recently took part in producing the movie Concrete Utopia, riding on the momentum created by its Netflix series Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area last year. With its high artistic quality and box-office potential, the film has been well-received by audience and critics alike. Expectations are now higher since it has recently been chosen to represent Korea at next year's Academy Awards of the U.S. in the best international feature film category. Song of the Bandits, a Netflix series produced by Baram Pictures in collaboration with Urban Works and Studio Dragon, will premiere on September 22. It packs an impressive cast including Seohyun, Yoo Jae-myung, Lee Hyun-wook, Lee Ho-jung, and Kim Nam-gil. Set in the turbulent period of Japanese occupation in the 1920s, the action-charged drama depicts a story of Koreans who head to the lawless land of Gando for different reasons but unite as one to protect their precious homeland. The passionate storyline of the much-anticipated show follows Japanese soldiers, independence fighters, hitmen, bandits, and displaced Koreans as they confront one another in life-or-death situations. Returning from a hiatus after her sensational performance in Extraordinary Attorney Woo last year, actress Park Eun-bin will come back in October with a show titled Castaway Diva (working title). The upcoming TV drama co-produced by Baram Pictures, Studio Dragon, and Kakao Entertainment revolves around the story of an aspiring singer named Seo Mok-ha who gets stranded on an uninhabited island and returns to the world after 15 years with a rekindled dream of becoming a diva. The third reunion of Oh Choong-hwan, the director of Big Mouth and Hotel Del Luna, and Park Hye-ryeon, the writer of Pinocchio and I Can Hear Your Voice is raising anticipation for yet another superb drama. Park Eun-bin will play the role of Mok-ha while Kim Hyo-jin depicts the role of Yoon Ran-joo, a top star and diva that Mok-ha admires. Other cast members include Chae Jong-hyeop as Kang Bo-gul, a producer of YGN's entertainment department, and Cha Hak-yeon as Kang Woo-hak, Bo-gul's older brother and YGN's news reporter. Kakao Entertainment will also showcase its grand projects which are being produced by mobilizing the entirety of the company's IP value chain targeted at audiences around the world.

Solo debut with 'Seven' motivates BTS’ Jungkook to continue enhancing musical skills,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3167994,2023.07.14 15:19,"BTS’ Jungkook finally made his official solo debut on Friday, with his first solo single, “Seven.” This solo debut comes a decade after Jungkook made his debut in the music scene as a member of K-pop sensation BTS back in 2013. “Through this single, I showed a new facet of myself that has never been shown better. The single is an addictive song that can be enjoyed easily by anyone. The first time I heard the song, I immediately thought, ‘I need to do this. This is it.’ I don’t easily get hooked on a song, but I did with this one. I could picture myself performing it,” Jungkook said, introducing his single to local reporters through a pre-recorded video on Friday. “Seven” is of the UK garage genre composed with an addictive melody and the sound of an acoustic guitar, which accentuates Jungkook's mellow vocals. “The rhythm, sound and mood of ‘Seven’ is very unique. The electronic rhythm in it makes it a perfect summer song that I hope to enjoy with a lot of people this summer,” said Jungkook. “The single sings about wanting to always be with one's loved one from Monday to Sunday -- seven days a week -- just like the title of the song itself. It is a passionate love serenade,"" he said. Many renowned artists took part in Jungkook’s first project as a solo artist including two music producers with Grammy awards, Andrew Watt and Cirkut. American rapper Latto also took part in this project by featuring on the single. “Latto infused her personal music style into the single well, making the track sound more attractive,” said Jungkook. Korean actress Han So-hee also starred in the music video for the single, which surpassed 1 million views on YouTube within just 10 minutes of its release. “I really contemplated how to make ‘Seven’ enjoyable for many people. ‘Seven’ is of a genre that I’ve never tried before. Even the process of bringing up this single was new to me. There was a lot to learn when I started recording. I now have a new goal of wanting to digest music better. I will give great concerts and performances with this single, so please look forward to them,” said Jungkook. Jungkook is set to perform the single for the first time on stage at Central Park in New York on Friday as part of its performance at the “2023 Summer Concert Series,” a summer concert hosted by ABC television network in the US.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/07/14/20230714000507_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,hansohee

Women-centered series go mainstream in Korean content industry,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3127874,2023.05.17 14:50,"Building on successes with charismatic, independent female leads, more women's stories set to entertain the viewers Portraying relationships between female leads -- be it friendship or rivalry -- is becoming the dominant trend for successful projects in South Korea. While 2022 TV dramas received both local and global popularity with strong, independent woman -- “Juvenile Justice,” “Extraordinary Attorney Woo,” “Under the Queen’s Umbrella” and more -- this year’s projects explore more female-centered stories with multiple female leads. Lim Ji-yeon and Song Hye-kyo, who presented a fierce confrontation between a school bullying offender and victim in Netflix’s smash-hit “The Glory,” are each set to return in new series with different partners. Lim, who played iconic villain Yeon-jin in “The Glory,” portrays a pregnant woman who is a victim of domestic violence in the Genie TV original “Lies Hidden in My Garden.” The thriller series is expected to be one of the most anticipated of the year, as top actor Kim Tae-hee makes a return to the small screen three years after 2020's “Hi Bye, Mama!” “Lies Hidden in My Garden” revolves around ordinary housewife Joo-ran (Kim), whose life goes in an unexpected direction after noticing a strange smell in her backyard and meeting domestic violence victim Sang-eun (Lim). The series is set to premiere on June 19 and will be available via local streamer ENA. Meanwhile, Song is set to star in another blood-soaking revenge story in “Cost of Confession.” Though the release date of the series is yet to be announced, the upcoming show presents the story of ordinary art teacher Eun-soo (Song), whose life drastically changes with an unexpected murder case. Many passionate TV drama fans shared that they were thrilled to watch the series as ""The World of Married"" and ""My Name"" star Han So-hee joins as a mysterious woman feared by everyone. “Smugglers,” an upcoming heist movie, hopes to become one of very few notable female-led films in this year, starring Kim Hye-soo and Yum Jung-ah as haenyeo, woman divers who dive without oxygen to farm the ocean to support their families. The film hits local theaters in July. Though many local broadcasters and video streamers have released melodramas and once-popular rom-coms like KBS’ “Oasis,” Disney+’s “Call It Love,” SBS’ “The Secret Romantic Guesthouse” and more, those series received less-than-expected attention from the audience, earning a single-digit percent viewership ratings. “As TV dramas are mostly enjoyed by female viewers, I think the ‘womance’ series are certainly quenching the female-dominated audience’s thirst for interesting stories other than a woman from a poor background falls in love with a prince-like male lead,” culture critic Hwang Jin-mi told The Korea Herald. Womance is a combination of the words ""woman"" and romance,"" referring to nonsexual, tight bonds between female characters going above and beyond ordinary friendship. Hwang believes the trend is likely to continue with more exciting stories in the near future as well.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/05/17/20230517000542_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,hansohee
"Among Korean films at Jeonju IFF, queer films stand out",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3117858,2023.05.03 17:19,"This year’s Jeonju International Film Festival, which opened on April 27, has nominated films of various genres and topics to the Korean competition, but what really stood out were the queer films that were nominated. “Of 111 Korean films that were submitted for the Korean competition section, we chose 8 feature films, two documentaries and one experimental documentary as finalists. A total of 11 films are nominated and they are either the first or second project of the filmmakers. It shows how Jeonju IFF serves as a gateway for these first-time directors,” said Moon Seok, who developed Jeonju IFF's program, adding that queer films have become a noticeable trend this year. Director Jay Han’s second feature-length indie film, “No Heaven, But Love,” revolves around a high school student, Joo-young (Park Soo-yeon), and Ye-ji (Lee Yoo-mi), who attends the reform school at a youth detention center, and their lesbian romance. Set in 1999, the film depicts the rough and violent atmosphere at the school in an era when corporal punishment was still legal and the harassment of junior students by senior students with violence was widely tolerated in the name of ""tradition."" Going through such struggles together, Joo-young and Ye-ji form a special relationship. “Although there are dark and violent scenes in our film, the fundamental genre of our film is romance. I did not want the film to be perceived as something too serious or too scary,” Han said during a talk held after a screening at the Jeonju IFF. Focusing on how Joo-young finds Ye-ji to be someone she can trust the most and accept everything without prejudice, Han shows that what’s most important in our society is the feeling of loving someone, not following social norms or living a standardized life with fixed biases. “These characters are pure. What makes lesbian love difficult is not that one is struggling to find one’s identity or having inner conflict within oneself,"" Han said, reflecting on how for the film's characters, love is just love. Han continued, ""Not all love is easy,” adding that this line says everything about the film: “I will stay with you even if I die next year.” In director Yoon Soo-ik’s “Heavy Snow,” which was shot in 2019, high school students Soo-an (Han Hae-in) and Seol (Han So-hee) agonize over whether they should continue do to filmmaking or acting. Seol, who is already a popular screen actor, shares thoughts deep inside her heart with Soo-an and the two become close. The film garnered attention as actor Han So-hee’s debut film, which Han Hae-in did before appearing in 2020 hit drama “The World of the Married.” “I’m the type of person who is easily swayed by the mood of the season and the weather. What I valued during the shooting was to portray the feeling of loneliness and isolation, and that was shown by the sea in Yangyang in Gangwon Province on a snowy day,” said director Yoon during a talk held after a screening of ""Heavy Snow"" at the Jeonju IFF. “I don’t mean to produce a work with certain purpose or intention, but rather stick to what I want to tell (at the time of creating the project),"" Yoon continued. “For Soo-an, Seol is a special person who not only makes her happy but also reminds her of what kind of agonies Seol must have gone through, after Soo-an also embarks on her acting career later on -- something she did not notice when both were very young,” actor Han Hae-in told the audience during the talk, adding that their romance may have been closer to a form of idolization.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/05/03/20230503000722_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,hansohee

Womance dramas dominate Korean television,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2828024,2022.03.29 09:14,"Hit television dramas portraying the special bond between female characters have given rise to a genre called “womance.” A combination of the words “woman” and “romance,” womance refers to the non-sexual, tight bond between female characters that goes above and beyond ordinary friendship. Though there have been many films and television shows centering around “bromance” – a combination of the words “brother” and “romance,” and the equivalent of womance -- including the hit movie “Friend” (2001), KBS’ “Boys over Flowers” (2009), SBS’ “A Gentleman’s Dignity” (2012), “The Heirs” (2013), action thriller “New World” (2013), KBS’ “School 2017” (2017) and “School 2021” (2021), womance-themed projects have started to attract attention recently. The romance between the two main characters aside, tvN’s “Twenty Five Twenty One” has captured viewers’ attention with the relationship of two teen fencers Na Hee-do (played by Kim Tae-ri) and Ko Yu-rim (played by Bona) developing from an athlete-fan relationship to rivals and best friends. With another high school friend Ji Seung-wan (played by Lee Ju-myoung), the 16-part series portrays teenagers pursuing their dreams and ambitions. The latest episode of “Twenty Five Twenty One” on March 27 recorded 12.9 percent viewership according to Nielsen Korea, topping the ratings among television shows airing in the same time slot. JTBC’s “Thirty Nine” presents a different style of womance with a trio of best friends -- Cha Mi-jo (played by Son Ye-jin), Jeong Chan-young (played by Jeon Mi-do) and Jang Joo-hee (played by Kim Ji-hyun) -- and their love lives on the brink of turning 40. The characters of “Thirty Nine” show a 20-year friendship that is stronger than the bonds with their families and lovers. It is a heartwarming story centering around the terminally ill Chan-young. Meanwhile, SBS’ rom-com “Business Proposal” is also riding the trend with the chemistry between young office worker Shin Ha-ri (played by Kim Se-jeong) and her childhood friend Jin Yeong-seo (played by Seor In-a). “Starting in 2016, broadcasters have been showing womance stories such as tvN’s ‘Dear My Friends’ (2016), JTBC’s ‘Melodramatic’ (2019) and Tving’s ‘Work Later, Drink Now’ (2021),” said culture critic Hwang Jin-mi. “As more drama fans, especially female viewers, got tired of watching characters falling in love with a Prince Charming, different approaches were needed,” Hwang added. The critic believes that the growing number of television series featuring womance allow the viewers to see many sides of women in our society. “Ranging from a calm career woman to a mother devoted to her family, there are different types of women. And this development, continuing since 2016, is meaningful to the Korean content industry,” Hwang said. “With the growing popularity of global streaming services, more multidimensional characters are being played by female actors, including Han So-hee of Netflix’s action noir ‘My Name’ and Kim Hye-soo of ‘Juvenile Justice.’” “Business Proposal” and “Twenty Five Twenty One” also caught global viewers’ attention, respectively ranking fifth and sixth place as of Monday on the global Netflix chart according to the US-based streaming analytics firm FlixPatrol.

"Han So-hee, Park Hyung-sik tell all about unrequited love in ‘Soundtrack#1’",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2825210,2022.03.24 16:15,"Global streaming platform Disney+ didn’t forget the romance as it went musical with its third Korean-language series, “Soundtrack#1.” Starring Han So-hee and Park Hyung-sik, the music drama revolves around two characters who have been best friends for 20 years, as their relationship changes in a romantic way. Taking the role of songwriter Lee Eun-soo, Han, 27, said that her character is a bright, honest person who does not know much about love. “Unlike the characters that I played in my previous projects, I am happy that I finally met a character that shares many similarities with me. Through Eun-soo, the viewers will learn and know everything about unrequited love,” Han said during an online press conference Wednesday. Park, 30, who co-stars the series as rookie photographer Han Sun-woo, hoped to capture viewers’ hearts with the couple’s emotional story.

‘My Name’ drums up excitement with tense action scenes,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2700532,2021.10.05 18:42,"Director Kim Jin-min is certain viewers who watch the first episode of his upcoming Netflix series, “My Name,” won’t be able to stop until they finish the rest of the show. “Most of the action scenes are done without a stuntman or stuntwoman. I avoided using computer graphics as well. I am sure that the viewers will be fascinated by the brutal raw action moves by the cast,” Kim said in an online press conference on Tuesday. Director Kim’s second Netflix series, “My Name,” is a revenge story of a woman who abandons her given name to find her father’s killer. “Though vengeance is a widely used theme, dominated mainly by men, I thought watching a female character on her journey to avenge her father’s death will definitely be thrilling. ‘My Name’ will be an intriguing revenge story,’” Kim said. “My Name” revolves around Yoon Ji-woo (played by Han So-hee), who joins the country’s biggest drug cartel, Dongcheon, to track evidence related to the death of her father. Thanks to the leader of the Dongcheon cartel, her father’s old friend Mu-jin (played by Park Hee-soon), Ji-woo enters the police force as a mole under the alias Oh Hye-jin. Actor Han So-hee pointed out that her desire to take up a role in the action noir genre led her to the production. “Though I was drawn to the scenario, I was a huge fan of the director’s previous work ‘Extracurricular.’ Just those two things: wanting to try ruthless action scenes and work with director Kim,” Han said. The actor was surprised to witness the gradual changes in her body as she had to undergo three months of physical training for the role at action schools before shooting the series. Han found the orchestration of action scenes fascinating. Asked what kind of work she looked up when studying her character and the action sequences, Han said that watching “Atomic Blonde” and “The Old Guard” helped a lot. “I also watched many YouTube videos related to female action scenes. Both director Kim and the action director wanted the actions to be real, not a predictable move from other movies and dramas. I practiced hard to hit the vital points of the body every day. ‘My Name’ gave me an amazing experience,” Han added. Though having performed a few action scenes in his previous works, co-star Ahn Bo-hyun said it was a different experience this time round. “As the ace detective Jeon Pil-do of a drug investigation unit, I had many action scenes with the members of Dongcheon cartel. With the outstanding action directors and fellow actors, who are not afraid to throw their bodies for a stunning action scenes, I am certain that I gave more than 100 percent effort at both training and acting,” Ahn said. Action scenes aside, one of the most satisfying experiences while shooting the series was the teamwork, said veteran actor Park Hee-soon, who took the role of cartel leader Choi Mu-jin. “I was able to feel that all cast and crew put their utmost efforts to create an appealing series and entertain the Netflix viewers with refreshing actions, including bare fist fights and bloody combat involving knives, guns and batons used by the police,” Park said.
