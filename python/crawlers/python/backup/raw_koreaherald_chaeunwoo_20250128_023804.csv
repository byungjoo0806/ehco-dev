Speak or not to speak? K-pop stars face dilemma amid national crisis,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10016786,2024.12.10 15:17,"After the shocking but brief martial law declared by President Yoon Suk Yeol on Dec. 3, several celebrities, including K-pop singers, have voiced — or at least hinted at — their stance on the ongoing political crisis. Speaking out on political matters has long been a taboo for idols, whose freedom of expression is often tightly controlled by their agencies. However, with the rise of social media and the globalization of K-pop, the question emerges: Should K-pop singers be restricted from sharing their opinions on politics and social issues? Trot singer Lim Young-woong, who is not a K-pop idol, found himself in hot water for an alleged exchange with an internet user regarding the impeachment of Yoon. Lim had posted a picture with his dog on social media, celebrating the pet’s birthday on the day the National Assembly voted on the impeachment motion. When a netizen criticized him for being “insensitive” during a national crisis, Lim reportedly responded, “Am I a politician? Why should I speak up?” However, his agency could not confirm whether the account in question belonged to Lim. In contrast, K-pop singer Lee Chae-yeon, a former member of the girl group IZ*ONE, expressed her views more openly on Saturday. While discussing the anti-Yoon protests held in Seoul on a fan communication platform, Lee challenged the notion that idols should stay apolitical. “Not in a position to talk about politics? Then what exactly is the ‘right’ position to talk about it?” she wrote. “As a citizen and a member of society, I’ll decide for myself when and what to speak up about. I’m using my voice because I’m an entertainer.” Lee’s remarks were widely praised for their courage, in stark contrast to criticisms against Lim for staying silent. Cha Eun-woo of the boy band Astro also became a target of online backlash after posting fashion shoot photos on Saturday. Some netizens attacked him for being tone-deaf during the country’s political turmoil, leaving comments such as, “Is this appropriate given the current state of the country?” and “Be more aware; don’t you watch the news?” Others defended Cha, arguing that sharing personal content on social media is an individual choice and that such criticisms were unwarranted. Industry insiders suggest that K-pop singers face significant risks when engaging in political discourse and that staying apolitical may be the safest route. “When artists engage in political or national issues, while they certainly have the freedom to express their opinions, they must also consider that their business relies heavily on communication with fans,” said a K-pop agency official, who requested anonymity. “There is no need for them to publicly align with a specific political stance.” Stephanie Choi, a postdoctoral researcher at the State University of New York at Buffalo, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing that K-pop singers often have more to lose than to gain by speaking out. “Fans often support celebrities in the hopes of reflecting and amplifying their own political stances. However, remaining silent or inactive can also be interpreted as a form of political action,” Choi told The Korea Herald on Tuesday. “Celebrities will always be under public scrutiny regarding their political views.” Choi added that K-pop singers face additional challenges compared to their American counterparts due to differences in market size. “Despite K-pop’s global popularity, the market remains relatively small compared to, for instance, the US music market. This limits the freedom Korean celebrities have to openly align with a particular political stance and cultivate a niche following within a broad global audience,” Choi said. “It is safer for them to remain apolitical to maintain their broadest fanbase.”",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/12/10/20241210050051_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,chaeunwoo

[Grace Kao] Webtoons in college classrooms,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3438738,2024.07.23 05:34,"While TV dramas may portray college classes with assigned readings, essays and tests, the truth is that professors also must adapt to technological shifts, especially in terms of media consumption. Webtoons are an important medium through which the Korean Wave flows. For those of you who are unfamiliar, webtoons are vertical “scrolling comics” built for viewing on a cellphone. They originated from and were developed in Korea. They enjoy a large fan base. For some people outside Korea, this serves as their primary gateway to understanding the country. Webtoons are also big business. On June 27, 2024, Webtoon Entertainment (backed by Naver) offered its initial public offering, WBTN, on the US NASDAQ exchange at $21 per share, raising $315 million, and valuing the total market cap of the company at $2.9 billion. Their annual revenue is $1.3 billion, and they boast 170 million active monthly users. A total of 900 titles have been adapted to streaming series, films, books and games. Of course Webtoon Entertainment is not the only company that allows artists to publish in this medium, but it is the largest and the one with which I am most familiar. In my class on Hallyu, I cover materials on K-pop, K-dramas and webtoons. Still, it was not clear to me how to incorporate it in my class. Through a contact from a Yale alumna, I reached out to the folks at Naver Webtoon in the US. Kirsten Pointer, the University Programs Specialist at Webtoon, organized a zoom visit with three of her colleagues that work on localization. Localization is the process through which webtoons created in one language (say, Korean) are not only translated but also made intelligible to a foreign audience in another language (for example, English). Of course, these professionals do not want to lose the essence of what is Korean about them -- as in K-pop, audiences are attracted to the “Koreanness” of the cultural product. It might mean that they maintain Korean names, but when puns are Korean-specific historical references, they can add footnotes and use a concept familiar to American audiences (when translating from Korean to English). This group was all US-based. Of course, there are now non-Korean webtoon creators. The extent to which their work will be localized for Korean audiences will be interesting to watch. I wonder if there’s an interest in non-Korean webtoons in Korea. In my class, homework assignments earlier in the semester included not only readings, but approximately five hours of K-dramas per week. The entire class watched “Itaewon Class,” but I also divided the class into teams, where they watched other dramas. By the time we reached the unit on Webtoons, we all read “All of Us are Dead” (a webtoon and K-drama about zombies in high school, which provided commentary on socioeconomic status, friendship and interfamilial relationships). We talked a bit about the similarities and differences between consuming webtoons versus dramas. We also talked about series such as “My ID is Gangnam Beauty” which was adapted into a K-drama and starred Cha Eun-woo, an idol from the group Astro. For some of my students, webtoons were more compatible with their busy lives -- they could easily read an episode or two between classes or when going to bed. I imagine that people in Korea can easily read them on the subway. Of course, Wi-Fi in Korea is generally far superior to that in the US. This summer when I visited Korea, Webtoon Entertainment in Seoul gave Lee Won-seok (formerly at Washington University in St. Louis and now at Yale) and me a tour of its large and sleek facilities. Our visit was led by Yesul (Ashley) Kim and Choi Woung-bi, both of the Strategy and Growth Team. We learned about how artists produce webtoons and the titles that have been most successfully adapted to K-dramas on Netflix. We spoke to dozens of people at the company where we exchanged ideas about their products and we talked about what our students liked and disliked. I found the staff at Webtoon in Korea to be very curious about American audiences. Often, the trait of the US that is most difficult for me to convey to Korean professionals (both at Webtoon and in the K-pop industry) is polarization in terms of race, class and political affiliations that affects all aspects of life in the US. This atmosphere has implications for the consumption of and interest in the Korean Wave. In my classes, those who are most interested in the Korean Wave are students of color (Asian, Latinx and Black), women and self-identified LGBTQ+/queer students. In Korea, gender and age seem to be more important in accounting for differences in taste and attitudes. I teach my students that understanding a social phenomenon is more intuitive when you have a comparison. For instance, it’s easier to talk about Asian Americans when we describe how they are similar to and different from whites, Hispanics and African Americans. My visits to Korea have not just taught me about Korea, but also the characteristics and quirks of the United States.

NewJeans appointed honorary ambassadors for 2024 Korea Tourism,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3432900,2024.07.11 14:46,"K-pop sensation NewJeans officially embarked on their role as 2024 honorary tourism ambassadors at a ceremony held at the Grand Hyatt Seoul in central Seoul on Thursday. The ceremony was attended by Culture Minister Yu In-cho who appointed the five members at the event -- Danielle, Minji, Hanni, Haerin and Hyein -- as the ambassadors for Korea tourism and Visit Korea Year 2023-24 campaign. Group member Hyein could not attend the ceremony for health reasons. Taking up the ambassadorial role, the girl group is poised to participate in promotional activities at home and abroad, starting with the overseas advertising video “Korean’s Korea,” which was released Thursday morning. Expressing his gratitude to the group, Yu hoped more international travelers would visit South Korea and immerse themselves in the country’s nature, tradition and culture, highlighting its undeniable growth in soft power. “We are honored to become the honorary ambassadors for Korean tourism. We will gladly promote the unique charms of South Korea,” Minji said in the appointment ceremony. On their first day as honorary tourism ambassadors, NewJeans shared some must-try activities and experiences while visiting the country. “The beauty of 'hanok' (Korean traditional house) with the beautiful nature as the backdrop will present the tourist with an unforgettable memory,” said Haerin. Meanwhile, group member Hani excitedly added that tourists cannot say they have traveled to Korea without experiencing Korean food. “As summer weather arrives, I think the tourists can enjoy ‘samgyetang’ (Korean ginseng chicken soup) and ‘naengmyeon’ (cold noodles typically served in a broth made of beef),"" Hani said. “Korean tourism was described as dynamic and creative. There are many cities full of traditions and festivals that overseas travelers can enjoy, ranging from K-pop concerts to musical and esports events. We hope for the travelers to explore every corner of this country,” Yu said, expressing his wish that the newly appointed ambassadors may draw more travelers in the second half of this year. NewJeans join a high-profile cadre of previous ambassadors, including another K-pop sensation EXO, Premier League football star Son Heung-min, singer and actor Cha Eun-woo and more. NewJeans made history as the fastest non-Japanese act to headline Tokyo Dome after debuting in Japan with the album “Supernatural,” which went on to top various charts in Japan. In January, the band won Group of the Year at the 2024 Billboard Women in Music Awards, becoming the first K-pop female act to take home the honor.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/07/11/20240711050564_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,chaeunwoo
Why Cha Eun-woo’s name keeps popping up in politics,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3335685,2024.02.27 15:39,"Young politician Ahn Gwi-ryeong's choice of main opposition leader as her 'ideal type' over K-pop star draws attention Actor and K-pop singer Cha Eun-woo is undoubtedly one of the most popular Korean celebrities at the moment. It is no surprise that Cha has often generated buzz in the entertainment news section and among fans of Korean music and drama. But in recent days, his name was mentioned multiple times among a most unexpected group of people here: politicians. It started with the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea’s decision last week to nominate its deputy spokesperson Ahn Gwi-ryeong to run in the upcoming April 10 general election. The 35-year-old news anchor-turned-politician was tapped to run for Dobong-gu, which has long been a stronghold for the progressive bloc. Controversy began brewing when critics started to point out that she was widely perceived to be an aide and supporter of the party’s current leader, Lee Jae-myung. Some within the party, including former Dobong-gu district chief Lee Dong-jin, criticized what he saw was the party favoring pro-Lee members in the candidate selection process. It was then when YouTube footage of Ahn playing a game of “ideal type world cup,” which is a tournament-style game in which the guest chooses the ideal celebrity they would most like to date, on a Channel A talk show, went viral. In the game, Ahn eventually chooses the main opposition leader over Cha, which drew a jokingly annoyed reaction from the interviewers. The footage was forgotten until the rival and ruling People Power Party Interim Chair Han Dong-hoon decided to comment on it. “If there was a candidate in the People Power Party who told me I (looked better) than Cha Eun-woo then they would never be nominated,” he told reporters as he was entering the National Assembly on Monday. “It seems Lee’s Democratic Party has become a jungle, where only brownnosers who can pick Lee’s nose for him on his behalf and say that he looks better than Cha Eun-woo can survive,” he added, while recalling separate 2022 video footage of Democratic Party Rep. Park Chan-dae seemingly picking Lee’s nose for him. Ahn soon fired back at Han, saying that he was taking things too seriously. “It is not Han’s job to turn an entertainment variety show into a documentary or bad- mouth the main opposition party,” she told reporters a few hours later. “I hope he focuses on improving the livelihoods of the people rather than on such bickering,” she added. The issue gained further momentum on Tuesday, when Democratic Party Rep. Park Beom-kye addressed the matter in a radio interview, saying that Ahn should thank Han for throwing her into the spotlight ahead of the election. Cha’s agency Fantagio was unavailable for comment.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/02/27/20240227050639_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,chaeunwoo

"Moonbin, Sanha of Astro make return as perfumers with 'Incense'",https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3034381,2023.01.04 18:04,"Moonbin and Sanha of K-pop band Astro released their third EP, ""Incense,"" on Wednesday, along with the music video for lead track ""Madness."" The two members conducted a press conference Wednesday afternoon ahead of the album's release. ""I'm excited and nervous. I'm also a little worried whether our fans will be satisfied, but we've really put in our everything so there is no regret,"" Sanha said during Wednesday's event. ""Incense"" marks the return of Moonbin and Sanha together 10 months after the release of their second EP, ""Refuge,"" in March. According to Moonbin, the new album continues the concept portrayed in the previous album. ""The concept is connected with that of our second EP. If we'd conveyed the message that we'll be a refuge, this time, we embodied the message that we wish to make everyone who listens to our music happy,"" Moonbin said. Fronting the album is ""Madness,"" an electronic dance music pop track infused with powerful bass sounds and big band elements, singing of intoxicating people with their charms, compared to their scents in the lyrics.

On the perfumer-inspired visual concepts and choreography, the two said they did not get inspiration from a particular piece of art but tried to make it natural. ""Before going to work I spray myself with perfume like a ritual, and I might have been inspired from that, out of the wish that people will feel like they could smell my perfume from our performance,"" Moonbin said.

[Newsmaker] Owner of Chinese restaurant accused as front for ‘China’s secret police’ says allegations 'unjust',https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3031226,2022.12.29 17:02,"Korean authorities deny any knowledge of reported investigation The owner of a Chinese restaurant in southern Seoul on Thursday requested for police protection, denying media reports that it may be one of the overseas fronts for China’s secret police. Holding a press conference at his eatery Oriental Pearl Tower in Jamsil-dong, Songpa-gu, the owner, identified as Wang, called the allegations “unjust.” The man said there will be another press conference on Saturday for which reporters are required to pay to attend. “The (Oriental Pearl Tower) restaurant runs an authentic business, but the news report made it a topic of conversation,” Wang said. “There is a great interest related to this matter and many have applied to attend (the press conference), but due to safety concerns and limitations in space, we will only accept 100 reporters. For fairness, we will sell the tickets (for the press conference) at 30,000 won ($23) per person.” Citing an unnamed intelligence source, Chosun Ilbo reported last Friday that Korean authorities were looking into suspicions that Wang’s place may be a local front for China’s secret police. The report came after a Madrid-based nonprofit group called Safeguard Defenders announced in early December that China was running at least 102 “overseas police service centers” in 53 countries including South Korea to watch and silence critics of the Chinese Communist Party. Laura Harth, campaign director of Safeguard Defenders, told The Korea Herald that South Korean authorities have not yet contacted the nonprofit group for more information or cooperation. “Korean authorities have not yet reached out to Safeguard Defenders, but we are confident in our hope relevant Korean authorities will coordinate and exchange information with like-minded democratic partners around the world to ensure thorough investigations into China’s transnational repression and undue influence operations,” she said in an email interview. Aides to two senior legislators on the parliamentary intelligence committee -- Rep. Kwon Seong-dong of the People Power Party and Rep. Youn Kun-young of the Democratic Party -- told The Korea Herald they had no information regarding the reported investigation. Officials at Seoul's Foreign Ministry have told reporters there was nothing they can confirm. The Chinese Embassy in Seoul has strongly protested the accusation that it was running “secret police stations” in South Korea, calling on media outlets to stop “deliberately perpetuating groundless rumors.” A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy said last Friday that China adheres to the principle of nonintervention in domestic affairs, strictly abides by international law and respects other countries' judicial sovereignty. The official added that Chinese security personnel and prosecutors have maintained a high level of cooperation with their South Korean counterparts by establishing close communication channels. In an earlier briefing, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson flatly denied the existence of overseas police stations. Harth at Safeguard Defenders claims, however, that the group’s findings appear consistent with “repeated statements by China’s local public security authorities” that these “overseas police service centers” were set up in close cooperation with the United Front Work Department, a CCP organization that seeks to influence various public and private sector entities outside China, including but not limited to political, commercial and academic spheres. “The UFWD promotes efforts that align policies and activities with CCP interests, and seeks to divide and silence CCP critics. It is evident any probe starting from our report on the ‘overseas police service stations’ should encompass both the wider transnational repression issue as well as the other interference these networks are engaged in on behalf of the CCP -- including, but not limited to, the Confucius Institutes,” she said. China’s state-funded overseas culture and language education centers called Confucius Institutes have been closing down in Western countries as US and European authorities have concluded them as fronts for Chinese propaganda, surveillance of Chinese students abroad and collection of high-grade academic information. There are 23 Confucius Institutes in South Korea, 22 of which are within national or private universities. In regards to the recent allegations surrounding the Songpa-based Chinese restaurant, a rumor surfaced that South Korean talent agency Fantagio -- most well-known for managing singer and actor Cha Eun-woo -- was involved in its operation. The suspicion stems from the fact that a person reportedly involved with the operation of the restaurant had formerly been an outside director of the South Korean agency. Fantagio on Thursday released an official statement denying such suspicion. Wang said he ran Chinese restaurants in Garibong-dong, Seoul, and Bucheon in Gyeonggi Province before he expanded to travel, interior construction and media businesses. The restaurant on a floating island on the Han River is registered as a branch of “HG Culture Media,” the head office of which is on the ninth floor of a building on the street in front of the National Assembly in Yeoui-do. The restaurant, which has suffered some bad reviews on Naver, said it will operate only until the end of December, after the news report last week. Opened in 2018, the restaurant saw operating losses of 230 million won in 2018, and 686 million won in 2019. As of 2019, its outstanding debt (1.32 billion on) was more than double the value of its assets (559 million).

‘Decibel’ to hit theaters in North America next month,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2999835,2022.11.14 15:17,"Director Hwang in-ho's thriller “Decibel” will be released in theaters in North America on Dec. 2. Shaw Entertainment, which has introduced hit Koreans films including Park Chan-wook's “The Handmaiden,” Yoon Je-kyoon's “Ode to My Father” and “The Admiral: Roaring Currents,” directed by Kim Han-min, to the North American market, will be distributing the new Korean thriller.

No stunt double for Kim Rae-won in ‘Decibel’,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2994546,2022.11.08 17:50,"Korean actor Kim Rae-won said he performed all the action scenes in the action thriller film “Decibel” directed by Hwang In-ho, during a press conference held at CGV Yongsan on Monday. “I knew from reading the script that there was going to be diverse action scenes. I talked with the director and we agreed that action scenes including car chases would be performed by a stunt double. But we had the discussion again on the set and I decided to perform the scenes myself to create a better film,"" Kim said. Jung Sang-hoon, who performed the car chase scene with Kim also shared his experience. Jung played a reporter character who provides an element of humor to the otherwise serious action movie. “As Rae-won said, stunt doubles were all ready to perform as we had some dangerous car crash scene. I actually had some fears,” Jung added. “Rae-won suggested we do the actions. Although I had fears, I performed with him because -- although it may not seem so -- I am ‘hyeong’ (an honorific Korean term meaning older brother). So I could not freak out, and did it with him,"" Jung added jokingly. In his new film, former navy commander Do-young (Kim) receives a mysterious phone call from a man who says that he has set up a special bomb that reacts to the surrounding noise level in locations filled with people, including a soccer stadium. If the noise level surpasses 100 decibels, the countdown time left on the bomb diminishes by half. The former navy commander desperately tries to stop the terrorist attacks but the caller keeps on threatening him, saying that the bomb can also hurt his wife and daughter. The director said he came up with the special bomb to make the film more dramatic. “A bomb that reacts to sound is different from ordinary bombs. It adds one more element that the protagonist cannot control,” the director said. Lee Jong-suk, who played the mysterious caller, talked about what he focused on in playing a villain for the first time. “It is a villainous character that is different from characters that I have played in the past. I think he is not just a villain because he has a deep sorrow. I tried to make him a more three-dimensional character,” Lee said. Cha Eun-woo of K-pop boyband Astro, who played one of the Navy personnel who got on board with Do-young also shared his experience being part of the project. This was his movie debut. “Rae-won told me that when watching a film for the first time, actors tend to focus only on their own performance and that it would be better if I could enjoy the film while looking at the big picture. I took his advice and watched the film comfortably.” Unlike dramas, Cha said he could monitor his performance and have a discussion after each take while filming “Decibel.” “We could check the roughly edited version on the set and everyone could make suggestions to make the scene better. It was an interesting experience,” Cha added. “When I filmed dramas, we had to rush sometimes. It was different for the movie and I could learn a lot from it.” The K-pop singer-turned-actor also sang one of the songs in the film’s original soundtrack album. “I sang the song while thinking about my character Tae-ryong’s point of view. Today, I heard the song as the closing music for the movie and it was touching.” Toward the end of the conference, actor Kim briefly talked about releasing a film after the tragic crowd disaster in Itaewon. “Because of what happened recently, I am careful to say this but the situation for theaters is difficult. So I hope that the situation can improve with our film,” Kim said. The film will hit local theaters on Nov. 16.",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/11/08/20221108000678_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,chaeunwoo

Astro boasts its signature freshness in 3rd LP ‘Drive to the Starry Road’,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2867540,2022.05.16 19:50,"K-pop boy band Astro is back with its signature freshness for its third full-length album, “Drive to the Starry Road,” delving deeper into new sounds with the band’s six years of experience. The six-member act held a press conference in Seoul on Monday afternoon, a few hours ahead of the album’s release. Member MJ, real name Kim Myung-jun, started his military service last Monday and was absent from the event. “Drive to the Starry Road” marks the band’s return after a nearly nine-month hiatus, after dropping its eighth EP “Switch On” in August. The group’s last studio album “All Yours” was released in April 2021. “We received a huge amount of love last year with the LP and the EP, and we’re returning confident with fresh sounds again. As it’s our third LP, we’ve put much care into preparing the album and we’ve included our solo songs for the first time,” the act’s leader JinJin said. Encompassing an expansive 11 tracks, the album is tinted deep with the unique colors of the group and its members as they tell of the past, present and future shared with their fans, Aroha. “The album portrays the path Astro has walked with our fans until now and the road we have ahead of us. It says that we’ve walked a starry road, which will continue to await us in the future,” Cha Eun-woo said. Fronting the album is “Candy Sugar Pop,” a dance tune overflowing with fresh and sweet sentiments. Members JinJin, Moonbin and Rocky took part in writing the lyrics. “We believe our strength is with the fresh concept, but hopefully we can also spell out our dynamic charms with the solo songs,” Cha Eun-woo explained. Listed on the album are four other group songs -- “Something Something,” “More,” “Light the Sky” and “Like Stars” -- as well as each member’s solo songs: MJ’s “Story”; JinJin’s “All Day”; Cha Eun-woo’s “First Love”; Moonbin’s “Let’s Go Ride”; Rocky’s “S#1” and Yoon Sanha’s “24 Hours.” “The songs represent the unique colors the members have discovered over the past seven years,” JinJin said, adding, “preparing a full-length album always comes with some pressure, but seeing the result, we’re more than satisfied.” Regarding the bandmates attempting solo songs for the LP, Rocky said, “We’ve each worked hard on honing ourselves on lyric-writing and composing. We thought that we were all now prepared enough to take charge of a single song alone and decided to include solo songs in this album.” Following the album’s release, Astro is holding concerts on May 28-29 at the Jamsil Indoor Stadium in Olympic Park, southern Seoul. “As people driven by the energy we get from our performances, we’ve really missed interacting with the fans. It’s a huge joy that we could be with the fans now that the (coronavirus) situation has eased. We’re working hard for the concert as well, so please look forward to it,” JinJin said. Moonbin added, “As it’s our first concert in three years, we’re as nervous as we are excited. We’re looking forward to performing live in front of the audience the songs from our albums that we’ve only showed online.” On their goals with the comeback, JinJin said, “Our goal is topping the charts, and we’re quite confident.” Wrapping up the event, Sanha defined “Drive to the Starry Road” in one word as a “dessert.” “The title song is addictive, and we hope people want to keep on listening to it, just like a dessert.”",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/05/16/20220516000730_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,chaeunwoo

What do you know about ‘aegyo’?,https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2744999,2021.12.21 19:25,"Aegyo is a key element of K-pop idols’ popularity The inclusion of “aegyo” among 26 Korean words and phrases added to the Oxford English Dictionary in October brought renewed attention to the word. According to the OED, aegyo is used to describe the “charm and cuteness, especially of a sort considered characteristic of Korean popular culture.” It means behavior regarded as cute, charming or adorable as well. The word is commonly used in association with adorable babies or cute pets. Traditionally, aegyo is associated with women making cute gestures, speaking in high pitched voices and using the third person, but the word has taken on a new meaning as a wider range of television celebrities are showcasing their aegyo, regardless of their gender or age. Many talk show and variety programs, including MBC Every 1’s “Weekly Idol,” even have dedicated segments during which celebrities can freely demonstrate their aegyo, hoping to charm viewers. “Ottoke Song,” (unofficial translation) created to showcase aegyo, is widely used by television celebrities when asked to show aegyo to fans. Because the music naturally allows even veteran actors and artists, who typically have strong personalities and aloof manners, to show off their charming sides, it has become part of regular many programs‘ music repertoire. While actor Cha Sun-woo and singer Key of Shinee showed off their versions of “Ottoke Song” in a recent online fan meeting and radio program, respectively, actor Cha Eun-woo performed the song in the tvN drama “True Beauty” to win the female character’s heart. As the impact of aegyo became more pronounced, making special gestures, like a finger heart, during an interview, press conference and award ceremonies became part of a routine for the Korean celebrities. Aegyo provides a chance for entertainers to close the distance and build an intimate relationship with their fans, while keeping their true personalities – and the risks associated with revealing too much -- mostly hidden from the public. In K-pop, most idols perform aegyo for their fans as a way of selling intimacy and maintaining close relationship with them. In the ever-growing K-pop market, 62 K-pop idol groups made their debut this year, bringing to total 150 new bands in the last three years. With competition like that, only a few can succeed. And amazing vocals, addictive hit songs and spectacular dance moves aside, aegyo has become another necessary element for an idol group to survive the fierce competition. After her debut as a member of K-pop girl group Girl’s Day, Hyeri rose to instant stardom after showing her aegyo on MBC’s hit reality show “Real Man,” a program that follows the life celebrities as they join the army as new conscripts, in 2014. Star director Shin Won-ho later revealed that he decided to cast Hyeri for Deok-sun’s role in tvN’s hit series “Reply 1988” after watching the singer’s aegyo on full display in variety shows such as “Real Man.” In “Reply 1988,” Hyeri’s first drama, she came to represent the series as a lead character. “Cheer Up,” Twice’s breakthrough song, became a national sensation in 2016, bringing the band multiple awards and trophies. The addictive chorus played a huge role in the song’s success, but the public recognition of Twice skyrocketed as Sana made countless media appearances, singing her famous line in the song, “shy shy shy.” By Lee Si-jin ()",https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2021/12/21/20211221000674_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,chaeunwoo
