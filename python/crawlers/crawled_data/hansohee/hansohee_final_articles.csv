Riding high on its artistic qualities, the film has been invited to a number of domestic and international film festivals, including the Jeonju International Film Festival last year and BFI Flare: London LGBTIQ+ Film Festival this year. ""Heavy Snow,"" which began production in 2019, has drawn attention as it marks the big-screen debut of widely beloved TV star Han So-hee, now 29, in a performance from her early days as an actor. The director of the film said Han So-hee had no second thoughts about making her film debut in a movie with LGBTQ+ themes. ""I think Han So-hee never viewed the fact that 'Heavy Snow' is a queer film as significant; we never discussed it at all,"" director Yun Su-ik said at a press conference in Yongsan, Seoul, Friday. Han So-hee was unable to attend due to personal scheduling conflicts. ""Instead, her focus was on the film's narrative tone and the essence of the characters within 'Heavy Snow,'"" he added. The director explained the film explores the restricted freedom individuals face as a result of their physical beauty. “We often hold specific expectations when we encounter someone beautiful, and tend to view them through the lens of stereotypes,” he said. “These factors can lead to feelings of depression and anxiety, restricting a person's freedom. Through this film, I wanted to throw the question (regarding such phenomenon to the audience).” Han Hae-in, a rising star in the indie film scene, has earned critical acclaim for her roles in ""Birth"" (2023) and ""Vestige"" (2022). She shared that she was drawn to the film by the intriguing qualities of her character, Soo-ahn. “Soo-ahn possesses a quiet inner strength despite her fragility, and such (dichotomy) compelled me to take on her role,” said the 35-year-old actor. “Soo-ahn is not someone who can be defined by a single quality — she reminds me of the ocean. I spent a lot of time thinking about how to give her the essence of the ocean, portraying her as a character who is boundless, impossible to define, and capable of infinite expansion,” added Han.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3482004,'Gyeongseong Creature Season 2': faster and ready to confront past,2024-09-25,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/09/25/20240925050523_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"The second season of ""Gyeongseong Creature,"" one of Netflix Korea's largest projects, promises a faster pace as well as an exciting new plot and characters to address viewer comments about the slow pace of the first season, director Jung Dong-yoon said Wednesday. The first season of ""Gyeongseong Creature"" is set in 1945 Gyeongseong, where Chae-ok (Han So-hee) and Tae-sang (Park Seo-jun) uncover secret experiments intended to transform humans into monsters. The series draws heavily on the real-life atrocities of Unit 731, a division of the Imperial Japanese Army infamous for the human experiments it performed in the 1940s. In the show, this is reflected through the Japanese military's experiments to turn Koreans into monsters. In ""Gyeongseong Creature Season 2,"" the story picks up 79 years later, centering around Chae-ok who is now part-monster, part-human and gifted with eternal youth. She encounters Ho-jae (Park), a man who strikingly resembles her former lover, Tae-sang. Along with the entirely new setting, the second season also introduces two new key characters. Lee Moo-saeng portrays Captain Kuroko, leader of a secret agent team working for the company behind the 1945 experiments, while Bae Hyun-sung joins the cast as Seung-jo who, with the ability to use tentacles, is on a hunt for Ho-jae and Chae-ok. The director emphasized that a key difference between the first and second seasons is the pace at which the latter unfolds. “1945 was a difficult year to portray, and I aimed for a more subdued representation of the era (when producing) the first season,” director Jung said during a press conference in Yongsan-gu, Seoul, on Wednesday. ""However, there was a 79-year time jump in season two. Given the series' modern setting, I focused on establishing a greater sense of speed that aligns with the contemporary era, using various elements, including visuals and sound,"" he said. Despite ""Gyeongseong Creature"" having one of the highest-ever production costs for a Korean Netflix original -- reportedly around 70 billion won ($52 million) in total -- the first season received mixed reviews. Responding to the first season's lukewarm reception, Jung said that he carefully reviewed viewer feedback and integrated it into the development of the second season. ""By the time the first season was released, the editing for the second season had already been completed. (However), I watched the public's reactions ... and I felt it was important to take full responsibility and asked to edit the series again,"" said Jung. “I can’t predict how the response will turn out ... (nevertheless), as the director, I focused on incorporating a lot of the feedback into the second season and helping the viewers connect with the series,” he said. Through the ""Gyeongseong Creature"" series, Jung said he wanted to communicate the significance of remembering those who have harmed others. “I believe it’s crucial to reflect on those who caused pain (to others) and to confront them assertively, without bowing our heads. This was the original intention behind creating the drama,"" said Jung. ""Forgiveness and forgetting are not the same, and I wanted to share this perspective with people around the world,” he added. The first episode of ""Gyeongseong Creature Season 2"" will stream on Netflix on Friday.",hansohee,4.0,"The article directly mentions Han So-hee as a lead actress in ""Gyeongseong Creature,"" where she plays the character Chae-ok in both seasons.

Ryu and Han’s breakup surfaced Saturday night when Han uploaded a 2001 photo of Nicole Kidman that had been taken by paparazzi as she walked out of the court following her divorce from Tom Cruise. The photo has popularly been used to express feelings of freedom and liberation after ending a relationship. Ryu’s agency C-JeS Studio shortly after confirmed “the two have separated.” Han’s agency, 9ato Entertainment, commented to a local media outlet that the two ended their relationship after they “realized that their roles as actors were larger than simply exhausting emotions between the two.” “They promised not to waste energy and emotions on personal stories,” the agency said in explaining the reason behind the breakup. Han’s agency also apologized for “not being able to take care of the artist well,” admitting that Han’s way of communication had been “wrong.” On March 16, Han wrote on her blog that she had started dating Ryu in early 2024 after he had ended his relationship with Hyeri in 2023. The blog post was just a few days after the new lovebirds were spotted at a hotel in Hawaii together. But news reports surfaced that the two had been acquainted since November last year, around the same time Ryu was reported to have ended his seven-year relationship with Hyeri, igniting rumors that Ryu may have “transferred” to Han from Hyeri. A ""transfer"" in terms of dating is used in Korean to describe one moving from one romantic partner to another with no or minimal time between the two relationships, likening the act to switching subway lines or buses on one's daily commute. As accusations grew around Ryu and Han, Han stepped in to actively defend herself and Ryu, saying in a social media post that she’s “not a person who likes someone with a girlfriend, or allows him to like (her) while being a ‘friend,’ or becomes interested and gives meaning to a relationship with someone with a girlfriend.” Han added that she doesn’t “interfere” with other couple’s relationships, although she is a fan of the TV program “Exchange” -- referring to the reality dating show where former couples live in the same house and decide whether they want to get back together or move in with new people. This led Hyeri to officially release a statement that she had not met Ryu again after November – the month in which Han insisted that Ryu and Hyeri broke up. But Hyeri did not specify the time of her split from Ryu. The post has since been removed.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3353178,'Transfer dating': Why dating without gap touches a nerve in Korea,2024-03-21,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/03/21/20240321050519_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Accusation of Ryu Jun-yeol's quick 'transfer' from Hyeri to Han So-hee evokes ill feelings Actors Ryu Jun-yeol and Han So-hee, newly announced lovebirds in the South Korean entertainment scene, recently vowed legal action against a barrage of what they say are malicious comments targeting their romance. In just three months, Han in particular went from being voted ""female celebrity most people want to spend Christmas with"" to losing endorsement deals. The mere accusation of ""hwanseung yeonae"" -- which roughly translates to ""transferring between dating partners"" -- can be damaging to celebrities whose careers depend on the public's affection for them. It was recently reported that Lotte Chilsung Beverage did not renew its marketing partnership with Han after it expired this month, and Nonghyup Bank did the same. Secondhand car sales platform Hey Dealer closed the comment section of its YouTube ad featuring the actor due to malicious comments against her. Fallout concerning Ryu -- the man at the center accused of the ""quick transfer"" -- has yet to significantly materialize beyond harsh online comments. It was reported Wednesday that multiple supporters of Greenpeace Korea have requested the organization drop him as an official ambassador. Greenpeace Korea told local daily Kukmin Ilbo that it is looking into the requests, adding it would ""do our best to find better ways to promote our campaigns.” Yet by nearly all indications, the love life of former media darling Han has led to her suddenly falling out of the public's favor. Actors embroiled in controversy Hwanseung yeonae is loosely defined among South Koreans as moving on from one romantic partner to another with no or minimal time between the relationships, likening the act to transferring between buses or subway trains on one's daily commute. The relatively short period between Ryu's relationship with Han and the termination of his prior relationship with singer and actor Hyeri, reported in November, resulted in the new couple being suspected of the detested form of dating. Last week, Han and Ryu were reported to be spotted at a hotel in Hawaii together, leading them to promptly admit to being in a romantic relationship. But reports have since showed that the two had been acquainted since November of last year, around the same time Ryu was reported to have ended his seven-year relationship with Hyeri. Upon reports of her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend, Hyeri unfollowed Ryu on Instagram and cryptically wrote ""That's funny"" on her page. Han then apparently responded on her own Instagram page, ""That's funny, for me too,"" saying she does not fall for anyone who is dating someone else. Both posts have since been removed. Upon public scrutiny that followed, Han issued an official statement saying that she started dating Ryu early this year, and his relationship with Hyeri had actually ended early last year. She urged the public not to use the word ""hwanseung,"" admitting that she was irked by the accusation. On Monday, Hyeri wrote in an official statement that she and Ryu talked about ""discussing the matter further"" after reports of them going their separate ways emerged in November. She offered an apology for what she said was an emotional response, vowing to be more prudent in her actions and words. While Hyeri did not specify exactly when her relationship with Ryu ended, she added that she did not actually meet with Ryu again after November. By the admissions of both parties, it does not appear that Ryu's relationships with the two women overlapped, although many in the South Korean public still believe he should have taken more time before moving on out of respect for his long-term romantic partner. Why people get offended by 'transfer relationships' Surveys indicate that most South Koreans believe people should take some personal time between romantic relationships -- though the terms of that time and how long it should extend remain elusive. Matchmaking company Duo conducted a survey on 197 men and 215 women, in which 76 percent of respondents agreed that there does ""need to be a gap between romantic relationships."" Of the respondents, 40.3 percent said ""people need time to process their feelings about previous relationship,"" and 22.8 percent cited ""there are manners (for the other person) when breaking up."" When one's former romantic partner immediately started dating another person, 52.9 percent said they suspected hwanseung yeonae. An October survey by matchmaking company Gayeon with 217 men and 111 women showed that 57.1 percent of respondents thought ""I've fallen for another person"" was the worst comment possible in a breakup. It also showed that 35.1 percent thought the other person ""transferring"" to a new relationship was the most baffling situation when breaking up. Being accused of hwanseung yeonae can be detrimental to one's social life as well. A 27-year-old woman surnamed Kang said she once became embroiled in such a complicated relationship while attending university in the US. Her boyfriend had been involved in an on-again, off-again relationship with his previous partner, who had thought they were only on a temporary break. The boyfriend, who thought they were broken up for good, went on to date Kang. The incident led to her friends pointing fingers and casting her out of the social group, accusing her of impropriety. As in the case of Kang, many incidents of hwanseung yeonae occur when two people are not on the same page in their relationship. Han Won-jeong, a manager for Gayeon, explained that much of the friction in a breakup derives from two people having different feelings toward each other. ""When the two people's stance (toward the relationship) is not the same, breaking up can be more difficult. A breakup involving a third party can be more shocking, but it could also lead to him or her letting go more quickly,"" Han said. For many people, the reason they take issue with hwanseung yeonae is that they suspect the foundation for the new relationship had been laid in the ruins of the previous relationship, even if the person did not cheat outright. This, they believe, shows a lack of respect for a person they once claimed to care for. “When my boyfriend starts dating immediately after we’ve broken up, I have to wonder if that relationship hadn’t already been started,” said 32-year-old Kim Hee-won, who experienced what she suspected was a “transfer” on her ex-boyfriend’s part. “When you end a relationship, particularly one that has continued for years, I think it takes some time to recover. Not needing such recovery time leads me to suspect that the relationship wasn’t so devoted after all.”",hansohee,5.0,"The article directly discusses Han So-hee and a significant controversy affecting her career as an actress and model.

Through the language of metaphor, the drama series incorporates the acts of Unit 731, a unit of the Imperial Japanese Army that engaged in human experimentation during the 1940s, into the plot, with the story of the Japanese military that conducts experiments to turn Koreans into monsters. Regarding the historical theme of the series, international viewers whose countries had been occupied by the Japanese military during World War II said that the content reminded them of their country's history. ""Though I didn't personally live through the era, we know that Japanese imperialists brutally exploited and enslaved the Vietnamese people during the colonial period. The fact that 'Gyeongseong Creature' portrayed that time of history on a globally popular platform by symbolically comparing the acts to turning humans to 'monsters' reminded me of the history I learned about my ancestors -- and I was gratified for the opportunity,"" said Cais Nguyen, a Vietnamese American college student living in New York. Vietnam was colonized by the Japanese military after Japan invaded French Indochina in 1940. ""Victims of the Japanese colonial era are all over the globe. I think the fact that contents are reminding the descendants about their ancestors' hardships is very helpful,"" she said. ""Even though I know the drama series was made in Korea, I wish the drama series also touched upon the Japanese military's evil acts all over the world, since the work is being released on Netflix, and starring influential figures like Han So-hee. The story could have resonated with more international fans,"" said Farah Megat, a Malaysian American student. Malaya was occupied by the Japanese from 1941 to 1945, following the onset of the Pacific War. Japanese audience also echoed the view that ""Gyeongseong Creature"" serves to spread historical lessons. ""The drama series achieved empathy from the audience that treating people unequally and with disrespect is unpleasant and horrifying. I hope that those who have seen this work felt that, and that this work becomes an opportunity for such practices to disappear from the world in the future,"" said a Japanese viewer on Filmarks, a popular online Japanese film review site, in the review section for ""Gyeongseong Creature."" However, there was also a number of reviews from Japanese fans that criticized the drama series for imposing a one-sided, negative image of Japan. ""I cannot support productions that depict a specific country as evil and plant a fixed image,"" one review read. ""I understand that Japan occupied other countries, but sometimes, when dramas set in this era portray Japanese people negatively, it feels like they are intentionally provoking anti-Japanese sentiment,"" added another review on Filmarks. Media experts said that dramas and films could be a double-edged sword in terms of delivering historical messages. ""Some Japanese who have seen the drama series express the opinion that they want to learn more about Japan's history, such as its colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula and Unit 731, which they did not extensively study about in school,"" said a media industry official based in Japan on condition of anonymity. ""However, the majority of Japanese tend to perceive historical issues in dramas as fiction or consider them as elements that heighten tension in the plot by invoking anti-Japanese sentiment. They often view these portrayals as 'anti-Japanese propaganda' within South Korea, and, (as such,) there are certain limits on using dramas for historical education,"" she added.",hansohee,3.0,"The article mentions Han So-hee once, specifically in reference to her being an ""influential figure"" in the Netflix series ""Gyeongseong Creature.""

Netflix's 10-part thriller drama ""Gyeongseong Creature"" centers around the stories of Jang Tae-sang (Park Seo-jun) and Yoon Chae-ok (Han So-hee), who infiltrate a hospital in the city of Gyeongseong (now Seoul) in 1945 -- where human experiments are held to turn people into monsters. The spin-off webtoon series, set against the backdrop of Manwoldo, where another human experiment took place, will narrate the story of Geum-ran, who, instead of turning into a monster through the same experiment, transforms into a powerful being with human intelligence. The official English title for the spin-off webtoon series is ""Gyeongseong Creature : The Unwithering Flower."" ""A new narrative is depicted with a focus on different characters within a connected universe, and the appearance of characters (in the webtoon series) like Chae-ok and Gato (from the Netflix drama series) creates an intersecting plot point, enriching and completing the narrative in a more intricate, deeper manner,"" said an official from Kakao Entertainment. After its domestic launch on Jan. 20, ""Gyeongseong Creature : The Unwithering Flower"" is scheduled to be released in North America, Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia through Kakao Entertainment's global webtoon platforms such as Tapas and Kakao Webtoon Thailand, but specific release dates have not been confirmed, according to Kakao Entertainment. ""Kakao Entertainment plans to actively strengthen its global IP competitiveness, by not only turning webtoon and web novels like 'Moving,' 'The Uncanny Counter,' and 'The Bequeathed' into visual content, but also by putting in continuous and proactive efforts to strengthen its IP value chain cases where stories and the media are connected, like 'Gyeongseong Creature,' 'Business Proposal' and 'Not Others,'"" said the Kakao Entertainment official.

Set against the backdrop of Gyeongseong, today's Seoul, in 1945, ""Gyeongseong Creature"" is a 10-part thriller drama that centers around the stories of two individuals who encounter monsters in a mysterious hospital. While the series proclaimed itself as a monster horror series, the computer graphics for the creatures left much to be desired, especially under a whopping 70 billion won ($54 million) production price tag. The CG quality in ""Gyeongseong Creature"" is even more glaring when compared to that of ""Sweet Home,"" a popular monster horror series. Studio Dragon created the CG for both series. Viewers may also find it difficult to immerse themselves in the drama as the characters mix the language and speech style that was prevalent in Korea during the Japanese colonial period with modern Korean language and slang. Perhaps the most problematic of all is the drama series' implausible and slow-paced plot. The romance between the main protagonists played by Park Seo-joon and Han So-hee, one of the integral events in the drama moving the plot forward, is unconvincing and rushed. Each episode is flooded with intentionally slowed scenes that drag the plot and running time. There was much excitement for the latest work by Jung who helmed tvN's romance drama ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" and SBS' sports drama ""Stove League."" He paired up with famed screenwriter Kang Eun-kyung, who was responsible for numerous hit Korean drama series including SBS' ""Dr. Romantic"" trilogy, MBC's ""Gu Family Book"" and KBS' ""Bread, Love and Dreams."" The unique combination of the popular monster horror and historical drama genres, and casting of popular actors such as Park, Han, Claudia Kim and Wi Ha-joon, only added to the anticipated frenzy. Even with the release date strategically scheduled over the holiday season to attract the maximum audience, ""Gyeongseong Creature"" has drawn mostly mixed reviews online.

Directed by Jung Dong-yoon of the hit baseball drama “Stove League” (2019) and written by Kang Eun-kyung of the “Dr. Romantic” series, “Gyeongseong Creature” revolves around a young man and woman in Gyeongseong, today's Seoul, in the spring of 1945 who discover the secret of Ongseong Hospital. “I had an expectation coming from the title itself. It is a combination of a period drama and a creature genre, but at the same time, it doesn't miss out on the intimate story of a young man and a woman. It’s a complex genre project,” Park told reporters during a press conference held in Yongsan, Seoul, Tuesday. Park said he also wanted to challenge himself to show a different style of acting through Tae-sang, his character. Tae-sang is the head of marketplace Golden Jade House, and is the wealthiest and the most well-connected person in Gyeongseong. He is someone who puts money before justice. That is until he meets Chae-ok (Han So-hee) and everything changes. “Besides focusing on showing good acting, I also put a special focus on the overall look because that decides the series’ first impression,” Park said. Han So-hee, who starred in the 2021 Netflix hit “My Name,” said she was attracted to the period drama setting of Gyeongseong in 1945. “I thought about what this creature genre series can give me (in terms of my acting career) and I was attracted to this genre,” Han told reporters. Her character, Chae-ok, is a famous bounty hunter who tracks down missing people, one of whom is her mother. She coincidentally encounters Tae-sang in Gyeongseong. Han said Chae-ok’s calmness and agile survival skills gained from her childhood spent roaming across Manchuria and Shanghai with her father in search of her mother have little in common with her. “I’m not a relaxed person. So I worried (about acting the role of Chae-ok) but I tried to remind myself that Chae-ok has a clear purpose in her life and is less influenced by her surroundings, whereas Tae-sang is a character who is swayed by the surroundings as well as the background -- he is a well-off man,” said Han. Others in the cast include Claudia Kim who plays Maeda, the wife of a powerful official in Gyeongseong during the Japanese colonial period. “Squid Game” star Wi Ha-jun plays Jun-taek, Tae-sang's best friend.

The series will be split into two different parts, with the first seven episodes being presented as “Gyeongseong Creature Part 1,” and the remaining three episodes scheduled to be released Jan. 5. With a star-studded lineup in terms of both its creators and cast, the thriller-action series is regarded as one of the year's must-see projects. Helmed by director Jung Dong-yoon, who was behind the 2019 mega-hit Korean TV drama “Hot Stove League,” and “Dr. Romantic” (2016-2023) screenwriter Kang Eun-kyung, “Gyeongseong Creature” takes viewers back to the spring of 1945, one of South Korea’s darkest hours. Set during the Japanese colonial period, the thriller series tells the stories of two young individuals fighting to survive against bizarre creatures born out of human greed. Actor Park Seo-joon, who rose to stardom with “Fight for My Way” (2017), “What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim” (2018), “Itaewon Class” (2020) and most recently ""The Marvels"" released last week, plays a wealthy entrepreneur, Jang Tae-sang. Though Tae-sang is a man who prioritizes money above all else, his principles are called into question after meeting Yoon Chae-ok, a sleuth renowned for her ability to track down anyone, even those who are dead. Actress Han So-hee, who made her Netflix debut with “My Name” in 2021, stars as Chae-ok in “Gyeongseong Creature.” Local drama fans shared their excitement about seeing two of their beloved stars perform together for the first time. Veteran actors, including Kim Hae-sook of “Hospital Playlist” (2020), Claudia Kim of “Avengers: Age of Ultron” (2015) and “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” (2018), Cho Han-cheul of “Reborn Rich” (2022) and “Squid Game” star Wi Ha-jun, will co-star in the show, unleashing a series of surreal monster stories set in Seoul in 1945.

Following last year's global mega hits such as Business Proposal, Hunt, and Narco-Saints, the diverse array of titles to be released this year demonstrate the company's outstanding production capacity. Prioritizing the creators' autonomy, Kakao Entertainment has built a solid multi-studio system which not only enables individual production houses to unleash their full creative potential, but also leverages organic synergy among them. Kakao Entertainment's upcoming lineup includes adaptations of its original stories to creative shows that target global audiences and will cover a variety of screen platforms including streaming, TV, and films. In line with this goal, the TV dramas Not Others and The First Responders Season 2, as well as the film Concrete Utopia launched off to a good start with impressive viewership. Not Others was produced by Kakao Entertainment's production subsidiary Baram Pictures in collaboration with Arc Media. This drama is an adaptation of a popular webtoon of the same name, similar to Business Proposal that created synergy between each business last year. The series tells the story of a careless mother and her cool-headed daughter who live together and bicker about everything because they never see eye to eye, all the while portraying the underlying love in their relationship. Since its debut in July, the drama enjoyed rave reviews and increased viewership ratings. The First Responders Season 2 was produced by Kakao Entertainment's Mega Monster in cooperation with Studio S. Building on the huge success of Season 1 last year, Season 2 is enjoying great popularity as it delivers a richer story by adding forensic analysts in the mix of police officers and firefighters. BH Entertainment, which has expanded its business into content production, recently took part in producing the movie Concrete Utopia, riding on the momentum created by its Netflix series Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area last year. With its high artistic quality and box-office potential, the film has been well-received by audience and critics alike. Expectations are now higher since it has recently been chosen to represent Korea at next year's Academy Awards of the U.S. in the best international feature film category. Song of the Bandits, a Netflix series produced by Baram Pictures in collaboration with Urban Works and Studio Dragon, will premiere on September 22. It packs an impressive cast including Seohyun, Yoo Jae-myung, Lee Hyun-wook, Lee Ho-jung, and Kim Nam-gil. Set in the turbulent period of Japanese occupation in the 1920s, the action-charged drama depicts a story of Koreans who head to the lawless land of Gando for different reasons but unite as one to protect their precious homeland. The passionate storyline of the much-anticipated show follows Japanese soldiers, independence fighters, hitmen, bandits, and displaced Koreans as they confront one another in life-or-death situations. Returning from a hiatus after her sensational performance in Extraordinary Attorney Woo last year, actress Park Eun-bin will come back in October with a show titled Castaway Diva (working title). The upcoming TV drama co-produced by Baram Pictures, Studio Dragon, and Kakao Entertainment revolves around the story of an aspiring singer named Seo Mok-ha who gets stranded on an uninhabited island and returns to the world after 15 years with a rekindled dream of becoming a diva. The third reunion of Oh Choong-hwan, the director of Big Mouth and Hotel Del Luna, and Park Hye-ryeon, the writer of Pinocchio and I Can Hear Your Voice is raising anticipation for yet another superb drama. Park Eun-bin will play the role of Mok-ha while Kim Hyo-jin depicts the role of Yoon Ran-joo, a top star and diva that Mok-ha admires. Other cast members include Chae Jong-hyeop as Kang Bo-gul, a producer of YGN's entertainment department, and Cha Hak-yeon as Kang Woo-hak, Bo-gul's older brother and YGN's news reporter. Kakao Entertainment will also showcase its grand projects which are being produced by mobilizing the entirety of the company's IP value chain targeted at audiences around the world. One such project is Gyeongseong Creature, a Netflix series scheduled for a simultaneous, worldwide release in the fourth quarter. Set in the spring of 1945, a grim era of bitter darkness, this thriller portrays the story of a young man and woman who struggle for survival while fighting monsters born out of human greed. It is written by Kang Eun-kyung and directed by Chung Dong-yoon from the creator group Gleline, produced by Story & Pictures Media, and co-produced by Kakao Entertainment and Studio Dragon, with Park Seo-jun from awesome.ent as the main lead actor. Fans from all over the world are anticipating the chemistry between Park Seo-jun and Han So-hee, and the show has garnered greater attention after the news that the second season has been confirmed even before the first season premieres. The Worst of Evil, a Disney+ original series that has gained a spotlight after the announcement of its scheduled release on September 27, is produced jointly by Kakao Entertainment and two of its production subsidiaries: Baram Pictures and Sanai Pictures. Set in the 1990s, the crime action drama follows undercover police investigators who infiltrate a criminal gang based in Gangnam, the center of drug trafficking between Korea, China, and Japan. The show has generated a lot of buzz due to its stellar cast that includes Ji Chang-wook, Wi Ha-jun, and Lim Se-mi. On the big screen front, a host of films are waiting to hit the theaters, including Hopeless (produced by Sanai Pictures), which received rave reviews when it was screened at the Cannes Film Festival this year after being invited to the Un Certain Regard section of the event, The Plot (working title, produced by Zip Cinema) that features Gang Dong-won in the leading role, and more. In addition to the lineup for this year's second half, Kakao Entertainment is accelerating its drive to plan and produce unique shows with creative storytelling, with more than 30 dramas and films in the pipeline. It will directly plan and produce a variety of shows, including Nine Puzzles (working title), the second drama directed by Yoon Jong-Bin. Subsidiary production houses are also working on a strong lineup of projects. In partnership with Pan Entertainment, Baram Pictures is producing You Have Done Well (working title), directed by Kim Won-suk and written by Lim Sang-choon.

Lim Ji-yeon and Song Hye-kyo, who presented a fierce confrontation between a school bullying offender and victim in Netflix’s smash-hit “The Glory,” are each set to return in new series with different partners. Lim, who played iconic villain Yeon-jin in “The Glory,” portrays a pregnant woman who is a victim of domestic violence in the Genie TV original “Lies Hidden in My Garden.” The thriller series is expected to be one of the most anticipated of the year, as top actor Kim Tae-hee makes a return to the small screen three years after 2020's “Hi Bye, Mama!” “Lies Hidden in My Garden” revolves around ordinary housewife Joo-ran (Kim), whose life goes in an unexpected direction after noticing a strange smell in her backyard and meeting domestic violence victim Sang-eun (Lim). The series is set to premiere on June 19 and will be available via local streamer ENA. Meanwhile, Song is set to star in another blood-soaking revenge story in “Cost of Confession.” Though the release date of the series is yet to be announced, the upcoming show presents the story of ordinary art teacher Eun-soo (Song), whose life drastically changes with an unexpected murder case. Many passionate TV drama fans shared that they were thrilled to watch the series as ""The World of Married"" and ""My Name"" star Han So-hee joins as a mysterious woman feared by everyone. “Smugglers,” an upcoming heist movie, hopes to become one of very few notable female-led films in this year, starring Kim Hye-soo and Yum Jung-ah as haenyeo, woman divers who dive without oxygen to farm the ocean to support their families. The film hits local theaters in July.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2700532,‘My Name’ drums up excitement with tense action scenes,2021-10-05,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2021/10/05/20211005000729_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Director Kim Jin-min is certain viewers who watch the first episode of his upcoming Netflix series, “My Name,” won’t be able to stop until they finish the rest of the show. “Most of the action scenes are done without a stuntman or stuntwoman. I avoided using computer graphics as well. I am sure that the viewers will be fascinated by the brutal raw action moves by the cast,” Kim said in an online press conference on Tuesday. Director Kim’s second Netflix series, “My Name,” is a revenge story of a woman who abandons her given name to find her father’s killer. “Though vengeance is a widely used theme, dominated mainly by men, I thought watching a female character on her journey to avenge her father’s death will definitely be thrilling. ‘My Name’ will be an intriguing revenge story,’” Kim said. “My Name” revolves around Yoon Ji-woo (played by Han So-hee), who joins the country’s biggest drug cartel, Dongcheon, to track evidence related to the death of her father. Thanks to the leader of the Dongcheon cartel, her father’s old friend Mu-jin (played by Park Hee-soon), Ji-woo enters the police force as a mole under the alias Oh Hye-jin. Actor Han So-hee pointed out that her desire to take up a role in the action noir genre led her to the production. “Though I was drawn to the scenario, I was a huge fan of the director’s previous work ‘Extracurricular.’ Just those two things: wanting to try ruthless action scenes and work with director Kim,” Han said. The actor was surprised to witness the gradual changes in her body as she had to undergo three months of physical training for the role at action schools before shooting the series. Han found the orchestration of action scenes fascinating.  Asked what kind of work she looked up when studying her character and the action sequences, Han said that watching “Atomic Blonde” and “The Old Guard” helped a lot. “I also watched many YouTube videos related to female action scenes. Both director Kim and the action director wanted the actions to be real, not a predictable move from other movies and dramas. I practiced hard to hit the vital points of the body every day. ‘My Name’ gave me an amazing experience,” Han added. Though having performed a few action scenes in his previous works, co-star Ahn Bo-hyun said it was a different experience this time round. “As the ace detective Jeon Pil-do of a drug investigation unit, I had many action scenes with the members of Dongcheon cartel. With the outstanding action directors and fellow actors, who are not afraid to throw their bodies for a stunning action scenes, I am certain that I gave more than 100 percent effort at both training and acting,” Ahn said. Action scenes aside, one of the most satisfying experiences while shooting the series was the teamwork, said veteran actor Park Hee-soon, who took the role of cartel leader Choi Mu-jin. “I was able to feel that all cast and crew put their utmost efforts to create an appealing series and entertain the Netflix viewers with refreshing actions, including bare fist fights and bloody combat involving knives, guns and batons used by the police,” Park said.
