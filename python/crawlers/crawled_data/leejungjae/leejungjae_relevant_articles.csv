However, the mention is brief and only in the context of his participation in CJ ENM's future content plans. The article doesn't discuss his work as a model, businessman, or director, and he's just one of several actors listed. While it confirms his identity as the correct person (male actor from Squid Game), the article's main focus is on Tving's business strategy rather than Lee Jung-jae specifically."
