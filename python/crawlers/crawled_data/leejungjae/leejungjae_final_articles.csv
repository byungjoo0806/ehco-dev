Netflix has officially announced June 27 as the premiere date for the highly anticipated third season of ""Squid Game.""
According to the streaming service, season three will thrust Ki-hun (Lee Jung-jae) into a relentless fight for survival following a failed and bloody rebellion against the game’s masterminds.
The upcoming season lands six months after season two debuted in December 2024. According to Netflix, both seasons were filmed back-to-back.
Alongside the announcement, Netflix also dropped a chilling new poster and a batch of first-look images.
The poster shows a masked guard dragging a lifeless contestant across an orange, flower-patterned floor arranged in a circular design. Cast in eerie shadows are the silhouettes of Young-hee -- the show’s infamous killer doll -- and Young-soo, a male robot poised to make his debut this season. The poster’s tagline, written in Korean, reads: ""Will you participate in the final game?""
Meanwhile, the first-look images paint an equally grim picture, with Ki-hun handcuffed to a post, appearing to seethe over the death of his close friend Jung-bae (played by Lee Seo-hwan). Netflix also teased that No-eul (played by Park Gyu-young), a North Korean defector working as one of the game’s masked guards, may be seen outside the game’s confines, with her mask removed.
The second season of ""Squid Game"" has maintained its position as the most-watched title across all of Netflix's non-English-language shows in its fifth week of release.

The creative minds behind the second season of ""Squid Game"" offered an in-depth look into the artistic, musical and cinematographic choices that shaped the show's most recent chapter, revealing some behind-the-scenes efforts that almost led to a major overhaul of the series' visual identity.
Award-winning art director Chae Kyung-sun, who has recently garnered a prestigious nomination from the American Art Directors Guild Awards in the category for ""one-hour contemporary single-camera series,"" shared her design approach in a group interview Thursday.
While there were attempts to drastically modify the iconic green sportswear worn by the participants, Chae explained that they ultimately decided to preserve the visual identity from the beginning of ""Squid Game.""
""Initially, there were attempts to change the color of the sportswear to sky blue or significantly modify the set design, but ultimately, preserving the existing symbolism proved to be the right choice,"" she reflected.
""We (also) considered changing the color of the bedding at the accommodations or rearranging the color scheme of the hallway,"" said Chae, who also worked on the first season. ""It was a rather bold challenge. But in the end, we decided to stick with the original.""
Chae divulged that her original vision for the set design featured elements drawn from a carousel, subway stations and public apartment buildings. However, not all of these concepts came to life on screen. She highlighted the carousel chosen for the ""Round and Round"" game, explaining, ""The carousel was a symbolic element that could convey both the festive atmosphere and the tension of the game at the same time.""
Music director Jung Jae-il, also a veteran from the series' first season, explained his approach to striking a balance between honoring the iconic soundscape of ""Squid Game"" while introducing fresh elements for the second season.
One particularly striking example of this was his rearrangement of the Korean children's song ""Round and Round,"" which has since become a viral hit and has even been heard playing in nightclubs overseas.
Jung said he infused the popular children's song with electric sounds to amplify the tension. ""I wanted to leave a strong impression by adding a cheerful melody to the scenes full of betrayal and tension,"" he noted.
Kim Ji-yong, who joined ""Squid Game"" to helm the filming of the second season, discussed his efforts to bring a documentary-style realism to the series.
""We chose camera angles that brought viewers closer to the characters and events, making them feel as if they are inside the arena, while sometimes using a distant, omniscient perspective for observation,"" he explained.
Kim emphasized the use of overhead shots in the game scenes, drawing inspiration from mitosis. ""The overhead shots resembling cell division imagery enhance the tension of the drama,"" he said.
Kim revealed that for the second season red and blue were selected as primary colors to thread throughout the series. The hues were strategically applied at multiple locations, including the exterior of the motel where Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) resides as well as in the dormitory for the games.
""I wanted to show that there is not much difference between the inside and outside of the game arena.""",leejungjae,3.0,"While the article discusses ""Squid Game"" season 2, which stars Lee Jung-jae as Gi-hun, he is only briefly mentioned once in reference to his character's motel location.

The second season of Netflix’s global juggernaut ""Squid Game"" has sparked debate since its release, dividing critics and fans alike. While the show remains the talk of the town, its sequel to the groundbreaking original has faced both accolades and backlash.
A week into its debut, murmurs of discontent have arisen, with detractors lamenting a perceived stagnation in storytelling and a lack of the first season’s ingenuity. Some have called the new games uninspired, bereft of the thematic depth or fresh insights that elevated ""Squid Game"" to its iconic status.
Yet, for series mastermind Hwang Dong-hyuk, these critiques come as no surprise.
Speaking during a recent group interview, the director reflected on the colossal shadow cast by season one.
“Season one was a project that came out without any expectations, wasn’t it?” said Hwang, during a group interview held on Thursday.
“I think the reaction was much more intense for the first season because of the surprise and freshness it brought to the world,"" he said.
Despite the polarizing response, Hwang appeared to take the critiques in stride.
From unmet expectations of sharper societal critique to the longing for dopamine-fueled spectacle, judging from the responses he got for ""Squid Game"" season one, Hwang said he knew the spectrum of fan demands was nearly impossible to reconcile.
""I understood that some level of disappointment would arise,” he acknowledged, adding that the decision to carry over the narrative into a third season likely exacerbated some viewers’ frustrations.
Among the more pointed critiques is the arc of Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), whose paradoxical journey has left audiences divided. Initially reentering the death games to save everyone, Gi-hun's later choices to sacrifice a few for the greater good raised eyebrows. Hwang, however, said he saw this as central to the character’s evolution throughout the three seasons.
Moreover, according to Hwang, Gi-hun’s ill-fated rebellion, a futile effort to upend the system that took place at the end of season two, serves as a microcosm of societal frustration.
For Hwang, this subplot is a reflection of the futility of fighting back in today's fractured world.
“I think over the time I’ve written and worked on 'Squid Game,' things have changed in a negative direction,"" he said.
“The anger, which should be directed upward, is instead aimed sideways or downward,"" he added, asserting that “The real fight isn’t among us — it’s against those running the game.""
As Hwang heads to the US for the Golden Globes, where the series has earned a nomination for best drama, Hwang admitted he isn’t anticipating a win for the series. The 82nd Golden Globes takes place in Los Angeles, US, on Monday.
""I believe (a work's) message is very important. Since neither the characters’ arcs nor the message was fully developed (in season two), I thought it would be difficult to take the new season to an awards ceremony. So, I had almost no expectations, and when it did get selected, I was genuinely shocked,"" he said, adding, “As for winning an award, I’m not expecting it. I haven’t even prepared an acceptance speech.”
Looking ahead to season three, potentially slated for 2025 release, Hwang teased a darker, more emotionally intense continuation.
“Season three will feature new games, and they’ll be quite shocking,” he revealed, adding that the last season will push the boundaries of human depravity and resilience. “There will be scenes far more emotionally intense than those in seasons one and two. I think it’s wise to be mentally prepared for that.”",leejungjae,4.0,"The article significantly discusses Lee Jung-jae's character Gi-hun and his character arc in Squid Game's second season, specifically addressing the controversial nature of his character development and choices.

Anchored by Lee Jung-jae’s reprisal of Ki-hun -- a man whose haunting past fuels his return to the blood-soaked battleground -- the new season promises to weave an even more intricate web of suspense and moral dilemmas in pursuit of a fortune that rewards the few who endure.
The cultural juggernaut’s sophomore outing arrives with a Golden Globe nomination for best drama already under its belt — a rare accolade for a series yet to premiere.
As the show lands just in time to brighten the peak holiday season, here’s a primer for newcomers and a glimpse into the mysteries that may await resolution.
Ki-hun’s Personal Life
In the first season, Ki-hun’s journey begins as a portrait of despair.
Divorced and drowning in gambling debt that leads him to signing away his body to loan sharks, he lived with his ailing mother while grappling with the fallout of his divorce.
Despite emerging victorious in the games and claiming the staggering cash prize, Ki-hun’s triumph was anything but celebratory. Haunted by the trauma, Ki-hun turns his focus to confronting the shadowy figures orchestrating the deadly competition.
As season two unfolds, questions linger: What becomes of Ki-hun’s personal life? How will his fractured relationships and lingering guilt shape his actions this time?
Deadly Games
Season one’s games offered a twisted blend of childhood nostalgia and brutal survivalism. Following is a refresher on the challenges that gripped audiences in season one.
Red Light, Green Light: Players had to freeze when prompted, or face instant elimination by a motion-sensing animatronic doll.
Sugar Honeycomb: Participants carved shapes out from fragile honeycomb candy, with failure resulting in death.
Tug-of-War: The team-based game required opposing sides to pull on a rope, aiming to drag the central marker across their line to claim victory.
Marbles: The game involved pairs of players competing against each other to win all of their opponent's marbles, using any agreed-upon rules, with the loser eliminated.
Glass Bridge: Participants had to take leaps of faith across glass panels, which randomly shattered under pressure.
Squid Game: The titular finale demanded one to navigate offensive and defensive roles to reach the head of the court shaped like a squid and tap it with their foot to win.
Director Hwang Dong-hyuk has hinted that season two will raise the stakes with even more creative and intense challenges. The official trailer revealed a new location for one of the games -- a Ferris wheel -- and viewers may expect games that test the limits of horror and psychological depth in the upcoming season.
Voting System
Season one unveiled a rule allowing participants to end the games if the majority agreed. Initially, players voted to leave after witnessing the carnage of the first game, only to return, driven by the despair of their lives outside the arena.
According to Hwang, the voting system will play a crucial role in season two. However, details about how the system will evolve and how it might significantly impact the storyline — something it did not do so much in the first season — remain unknown.
Will the system evolve? How will the votes impact the course of the games and the story of the second season of ""Squid Game""?
The Frontman and Jun-ho’s Relationship
Season one ended with a shocking revelation that the enigmatic Frontman (Lee Byung-hun), who oversees the deadly games, was Jun-ho’s estranged older brother. Jun-ho (Wi Ha-joon) is a determined police officer who infiltrated the games to uncover their secrets.
In a dramatic turn, at the end of the season the Frontman shoots Jun-ho, sending him plummeting off a cliff.
Season two teases at Jun-ho’s survival and his potential return, setting the stage for an exploration of family ties, justice and dark forces behind the games.

As of Wednesday, shares of Artist United— Lee's agency in which he is the largest shareholder with a 23.49 percent stake -- closed at 13,320 won ($9) per share, marking a 29.25 percent increase from the previous day.
Meanwhile, shares of Artist Studio, the Korean drama production company behind titles like ""Maestra"" (2023) and ""Reborn Rich"" (2022), rose by 29.95 percent to close at 15,490 won per share. Artist Studio’s management rights were recently acquired by Lee.
Share prices of these two companies dropped following news last Friday of financial authorities' investigations into allegations of insider trading and stock price manipulation.
In December of last year, Lee and actor Jung Woo-sung became the largest shareholders of Wider Planet (now renamed Artist United) after acquiring 45 percent and 9 percent of the shares in the company, respectively.
The financial investigations followed reports suggesting that certain groups had prior knowledge of Lee and Jung’s acquisition of the company.
After buying stocks at a low price, these groups allegedly manipulated the market by promoting the company's stocks as ""Han Dong-hoon theme stocks"" to make a profit.
""Han Dong-hoon theme stocks"" refer to stocks that are in some way related to People Power Party leader Han Dong-hoon. The ""Han Dong-hoon theme stocks"" have reportedly seen dramatic increases in value after President Yoon Suk Yeol’s unexpected declaration of martial law on Dec. 3. Shares of Artist United and Artist Studio were dubbed ""Han Dong-hoon theme stocks"" following the revelation that Lee and People Power Party leader Han Dong-hoon were high school classmates.
Following the news of the investigation, Artist United issued a statement Friday clarifying that while Wider Planet (now Artist United) was previously investigated by financial authorities, the company and Lee Jung-jae are not currently subjects of any investigation.

The 2025 Golden Globes, to be held Jan. 5, 2025, required submissions by Nov. 4 for shows that premiered within the 2024 calendar year. With its Dec. 26 premiere, the second season of ""Squid Game"" narrowly qualified, with Netflix reportedly submitting the series early for consideration.
In the best TV drama series category, for which the show was nominated, ""Squid Game"" competes against FX and Hulu's ""Shogun,"" which made Emmy history by winning 18 categories at the 76th Primetime Emmy Awards and 76th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards early this year. Other nominees in the category include Netflix's ""The Diplomat,"" Apple TV+'s ""Slow Horses,"" Amazon Prime Video's ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" and Peacock's ""Day of the Jackal.""

Individually, French musical crime film ""Emilia Perez,"" starring Selena Gomez, led the pack with 10 nominations, the highest across both film and TV.

The trailer also features new scenes, including new cast members Im Si-wan and Park Gyu-young receiving their invitations, and Ki-hun rallying participants to rebel against the creators of the death games.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3844374,[What to Watch] Three classic Korean fall films you should watch this month,2024-11-09,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/11/07/20241107050844_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"As the leaves start to turn red and yellow and a chill hits the air, it is about time to curl up with a cozy blanket, a warm beverage and a classic novel, or better yet, a classic autumn film. While early fall may have been more focused on spooky movies, November is the perfect time to enjoy iconic films featuring first loves, farewells and fateful desires. The Korea Herald has picked three must-watch, classic fall films for you to try this month. “Il Mare” (2000) Directed by Lee Hyun-seung, the title directly translates into “the sea” in Italian, a nod to the setting of the story — a seaside house. Architect Sung-hyun (Lee Jung-Jae) moves into the seaside home that his estranged father built. One day, he discovers a letter in his mailbox, which was sent by a young woman who seems to be writing from a different time. More letters arrive and in those letters her predictions are accurate — she warns about a flurry of snow on a certain day in January of 1998. At the same time, Eun-joo (Gianna Jun), now convinced that her letters have traveled back in time to December of 1997, starts writing regularly to Sung-hyun. As the two protagonists live in the same house two years apart in time, but able to communicate through a mysterious mailbox, the movie reveals the fate and heartbreak of the star-crossed lovers. “One Fine Spring Day” (2001) Though the title includes the season of spring, the mood of the movie is closer to a crisp fall day. Director Hur Jin-ho’s depiction of a seemingly flat plot line -- a sound engineer falls in love with a radio show host after they work on a project together -- is beautifully expressed on the big screen. His sincere observation of what love is elevates the somewhat predictable story.

There, she meets and befriends a South Korean man on-the-run named Hoon (Hyun Bin). Throughout its depiction of poignant and genuine aspects of love and life, the movie weaves in subtle nuances of different cultures -- a result of the co-production between South Korea, China and the US.

As of Wednesday, ""The Acolyte"" holds an 18 percent average audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, the lowest ever for a ""Star Wars"" series on the site, and a 4.1 rating on IMDb. The low audience ratings are largely due to backlash over the series' poor writing and its deviations from the established ""Star Wars"" lore.

Kim Dong-rae, the head of RaemongRaein, said via a press release on Monday that Artist United, a company in which Lee stands as the largest stakeholder, has been unjustly pushing RaemongRaein to convene an extraordinary general meeting in a bid to replace its head and overhaul the company's board of directors. According to Kim, the pressure comes after RaemongRaein objected to Artist United's decision to acquire another company. Currently, Artist United and related individuals stand as the largest stakeholder of RaemongRaein with 29.33 percent stake, while Lee holds 23.49 percent stake in Artist United. ""RaemongRaein decided to partner with actor Lee Jung-jae's Artist United because we believed that his extensive network and financial influence could facilitate our aspirations for global expansion. Artist United also persuaded us by presenting concrete plans,"" Kim said in the press release. ""However, contrary to what was discussed before the investment, we learned that Artist United intended to use RaemongRaein's funds to acquire a listed company whose trading has been suspended,"" he said. ""Therefore, the current management team (of RaemonRaein), including myself, delivered the message (to Artist United) that we could not accept the acquisition of a listed company that does not coincide with RaemongRaein's core business,"" Kim added. According to Kim, the response RaemonRaein received in turn was a unilateral notice to hold an extraordinary general meeting to change the head of RaemongRaein and the company name, replace the entire board of directors and amend the articles of incorporation. ""The actions of these investors, which took place less than three months after becoming the largest shareholder, seem to indicate that they intended to use RaemongRaein's cash assets to acquire other companies. It has become clear that the true purpose of their investment was not the initially proposed production of various content or acquisition of intellectual property for RaemongRaein's global expansion,"" said Kim. ""We cannot allow RaemongRaein, which all employees have worked together to build over the past 18 years for content's advancement, to fall prey to forces seeking to seize management control through deceitful methods,"" he added. Kim's announcement came after Artist United on Wednesday filed an application with the court seeking approval to hold an extraordinary general meeting to appoint RaemongRaein's directors. Artist United additionally initiated legal action against Kim seeking compensation for damages. According to Lin, the law firm that represents Artist United, Kim purportedly impeded Artist United's involvement in management by disregarding investors' rightful request for an extraordinary general meeting. Lin added that Kim has been disregarding investors' demands to include Lee Jung-jae and fellow actor Jung Woo-sung in managing RaemongRaein. Meanwhile, shares of RaemongRaein had risen by 15.1 percent on Monday as of noon, selling at 16,830 won ($12) a share.

The series is also rife with meticulously choreographed action sequences that dynamically blends martial arts with the use of the Force. The eight-part series, set a century before ""Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,"" follows the story of Osha (Amandla Stenberg), who is accused of murdering a number of Jedi. She is accompanied by Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae), his Padawan Jecki Lon (Dafne Keen) and Jedi Knight Yord Fandar (Charlie Barnett) as she sets out on a journey to prove her innocence. One of the highlights of the series is Lee's performance, in which he uniquely embodies one of the first Jedi. Jedi usually refrain from expressing emotions, according to their traditions. However, during a press conference on Wednesday, Lee said that with the freedom granted to him in portraying one of the earliest Jedi in the franchise, he aimed to depict a Jedi who embodies more humanity than others seen throughout the series. And he has succeeded in doing just that. Appearing as an empathetic former teacher for Osha, who is scared and confused about being accused of a string of murders that shake up her world, Lee, with the help of his extensive 31-year acting career, convincingly portrays the reliable, senior figure who Osha can rely on. His delivery, despite speaking in a second language, remains strong. Another highlight of the series is the action. Especially noteworthy is the battle between Jedi Master Indara (Carrie-Anne Moss) and her assailant, which opens up the show. The battle scene is characterized by a visually striking and carefully choreographed sequence that blends physical and Force-based attacks. The first two episodes of ""The Acolyte"" are a fun watch. The series significantly lowers psychological hurdles for nonentrenched fans to dive into a ""Star Wars"" series by majorly incorporating mystery thriller elements.

The 8-part series tells the story of Osha (played by Amandla Stenberg), who is accused of a string of murders targeting Jedi -- the practitioners of the Force's energies. The series is set a century before the events of ""Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,"" the first film in the ""Star Wars"" prequel trilogy. In the series, Lee portrays one of the lead roles, Master Sol, a respected Jedi master who accompanies Osha in discovering the suspect behind the murders. Some online commenters have criticized the casting for ""The Acolyte,"" which features Stenberg, a Black Danish-American female protagonist, as well as Filipino-Canadian Manny Jacinto and Jamaican-British-American Jodie Turner-Smith, in other major roles. While many praise the diverse cast, some who criticize the series argue that Disney has placed political correctness ahead of its storylines by casting actors from minority ethnic backgrounds. Asked how he thought about such backlash, Lee said he deemed such criticism ""natural,"" given fans' loyalty to the ""Star Wars"" franchise. ""I naturally think that such criticism could exist,"" said Lee, during a press conference held in Yongsan-gu, Seoul, Wednesday. ""Because there are fans who have passionately supported 'Star Wars' for a long time. When I took part in a Star Wars Day event in London, (the attendance) exceeded my expectations 50-fold. A massive turnout of fans graced the event and the level of enthusiasm was among the highest I've ever witnessed at a gathering. So, it's understandable that individuals might express their own thoughts in that manner,"" said Lee. ""'The Acolyte' is set against various backgrounds. The show even features aliens. I think the director intended to have more diverse characters in 'The Acolyte' by casting me,"" he said. Lee said Master Sol embodies a more humane persona compared to other Jedis. ""When thinking about how to develop the character, rather than acting out a stereotypical Jedi, I wanted to have (a Jedi) that expressed more humane emotions,"" said Lee. ""So, when feeling fear, I actively expressed that fear, and I tried to be more expressive in portraying emotions. I believed it would establish tone that was distinct from the Jedi characters we had seen thus far,"" he said. The most challenging aspect of acting as Master Sol was delivering the lines in English, Lee recalled. ""The biggest challenge in filming 'The Acolyte' was having to act in English. Even when acting in Korean, if you get the accent or intonation wrong, the delivery of the lines can suffer. So, having to perform all the lines in English required a lot of attention,"" he said. The actor worked with four English teachers for the role. ""We trained in advance via Zoom, and once I got to London where the filming took place, we continued training both in person and over Zoom. Thankfully, I was able to start filming after gaining some familiarity with English,"" Lee said. ""I would like to express my gratitude to the director and the staff for their consideration of my limited proficiency in English.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3356352,[Grace Kao] How makgeolli signals virtue in K-dramas,2024-03-26,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/03/25/20240325050786_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Makgeolli, a milky-colored and lightly carbonated type of Korean rice wine, is a common topic of conversation in our household. Since 2015, my husband, Jeff Rubidge, has been brewing and uploading videos about makgeolli for his YouTube channel. It is a modest drink that only requires three ingredients to brew: rice, nuruk (a Korean fermentation starter) and water. It can be purchased for less than US $2 per bottle in Korea. I have also noticed its role in signaling virtue in K-dramas. Let me explain. One of the distinctive features of the Korean diet is the importance of fermented foods. Even Americans not familiar with Korean food know that every Korean meal includes kimchi. Of course, kimchi is just one of the many Korean foods with a fermented element (think of doenjang, or soy bean paste, and the many banchan that include fermented ingredients). Makgeolli is a fermented rice wine that was commonly made at home. During the Japanese occupation, makgeolli was first taxed and eventually banned in 1934. Arguably, makgeolli is viewed as a nationalistic and traditional liquor associated with farmers, college students and the working class, rather than the elite. When I first began watching K-dramas, I noticed that the drink of choice for most characters was soju or beer (and sometimes both mixed together). On a date, the characters might enjoy coffee at a cafe or wine with their Italian meals. Rich chaebol families or politicians corrupted by money and power drink expensive Western spirits. Every so often, makgeolli would appear and signal the virtue and incorruptibility of its drinkers. “Vincenzo” has made effective use of makgeolli to signal virtue and “Korean-ness.” Vincenzo (played by Song Joong-ki), the lead character, is a Korean adoptee who was moved to Italy as a child. In Episode 2, upon his return to Korea as an adult, he drinks makgeolli for the first time with the honest lawyer Hong Yu-chang (Yoo Jae-myung). While consuming makgeolli together, Hong Yu-chang talks about how the powerless need to be defended. “When they have no one left to lean on. I can still be there to grab onto. I am their last straw.” He then tells Vincenzo he seems more genuine today -- and the makgeolli signals this shift. It also suggests that Vincenzo is becoming more Korean. In Episode 3, he is again drinking with Hong Yu-chang. Vincenzo warns him, “You’re in no man’s land, completely exposed -- so swallow your pride. Back down and lick your wounds.” Hong Yu-chang replies, “My pride is not on the line, innocent lives are.” The lawyer shows no fear. They drink at least six bottles of makgeolli during this dinner. That evening, a truck rams into the restaurant, killing Hong Yu-chang. In Episode 10, Vincenzo drinks makgeolli with his love interest Hong Cha-young (the daughter of Hong Yu-chang). She was formerly estranged from her father and worked for the evil Wusang law firm. Now, she has transitioned to being a virtuous person and her shift is signaled by her consumption of makgeolli. Vincenzo tells her that her father “wanted someone to fight the righteous fight” and that Hong Cha-young was that person. Of course, Vincenzo and Hong Cha-young are also honoring her incorruptible father by drinking makgeolli. This sentiment also appears in the K-drama “Beyond Evil.” In Episode 11, after Nam Sang-bae (the Chief of Police, played by Chun Ho-jin) is murdered by the villains, his teammates celebrate his life by drinking makgeolli at a Korean barbecue restaurant. They reminisce about the last time they had makgeolli with the police chief. Virtue and innocence can also be conveyed using makgeolli. In Episode 13 of “Taxi Driver” (Season 2), the story of the nightclub Black Sun (a thinly-veiled reference to the Burning Sun scandal) continues. In the Black Sun club, wealthy customers drink expensive bottles of Cristal champagne while taking illicit drugs. Some of these patrons also drug and rape women. In a funny scene in this dark episode, the Taxi Driver crew (which serves to dish out revenge in the show) brings a group of older and less trendy customers to the club -- they appear in contrast to the rich, young, criminal and amoral clientele of the club. Instead of drinking gold bottles of Cristal, they consume white bottles of makgeolli. A great use of makgeolli to signal incorruptibility is in the political K-drama, “Chief of Staff‘’ starring Lee Jung-jae (familiar to Americans due to “Squid Game”). In Episode 4 of Season 1, the extremely corrupt Assemblyman Song Hee-seop (Kim Kap-soo) throws a bowl of makgeolli to the ground and shouts: “Do you know what I first threw away when I became an assemblyman? My sense of shame. You can be in politics only after throwing that out.” My advice is this -- if you need to know whether someone is virtuous in Korea, pay attention to what they’re drinking. At least, if you’re a character in a K-drama.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3045759,[헬로 한글] 생각보다 높은 1인치 자막의 장벽,2023-01-25,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/01/25/20230125000464_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"“1인치 정도 되는 장벽을 뛰어 넘으면 여러분들이 훨씬 더 많은 영화를 즐길 수 있습니다.” 영화 '기생충'으로 2020년 골든 글로브를 거머쥔 봉준호 감독이 수상 소감으로 한 말이다. 1년 뒤 '오징어 게임'은 이 1인치 장벽을 가뿐히 뛰어넘으며, 넷플릭스 상 압도적 세계 점유율을 기록했고, 골든 글로브, 에미상, 백상예술대상 등 국내외 시상식을 휩쓸었다. 이를 기점으로 예전에는 내수용이라고 생각되던 수많은 한국 드라마가 입소문을 타고 해외 시청자들에게 소비되며 한글 컨텐츠를 다양한 언어로 번역하는 것은 세계 OTT 플랫폼들에게 중요한 과제가 되었다. 하지만, 일부 시청자들은 번역된 자막이 한국어 대사의 의미와 뉘앙스를 제대로 담아내지 못하고 있다고 여전히 불만을 표현하고 있다. '오징어 게임'이 한참 인기일 때 미국 코미디언 겸 인플루언서 영미 마이어(Youngmi Mayer)는 자신의 소셜 미디어에 “원래 대사는 잘 쓰여져 있지만, (자막에는) 제대로 전달되지 않았다”고 적었다. 그는 특히 극 중 한미녀 (김주령)의 대사를 오역으로 지적했다. “내가 공부를 안 해서 그렇지 머리는 장난 아니라니까”라는 한국어 대사가 영어로는 “난 천재는 아니지만 잘 해냈어”(I’m not a genius, but I still got it worked out)로 번역 된 점을 오역으로 지적했다. 마이어는 자신이 지적한 부분은 일반 시청자를 위한 자막이 아닌, 청각 장애인 등을 위한 더빙 버전의 영어 폐쇄자막이라는 점을 덧붙였다. 디즈니플러스 이용자 대만인 첸모(31)씨는 “세계적으로도 유명한 한국 예능 아니 드라마에 자막 오역을 꽤 많다는 것에 놀랐다”고 했다. “한국인 친구를 통해 ‘꼴값 떤다’라는 말이 ‘싸가지 없다’나 ‘아니꼽게 군다’처럼 좋지 않는 뜻을 내포하는 속어라는 사실을 알게 되었습니다. 하지만 디즈니플러스의 ‘더 존: 버텨야 산다’에서는 이를 ‘그만 좀 해’(give me a break)라고 번역 했습니다.” 자신과 같이 한국어에 관심이 있는 외국인 시청자가 많은데, 이 같은 오역은 해당 표현의 잘못된 사용으로 이어질 수도 있는 문제라고 지적했다. 이와 반대로 재치 있는 자막으로 보는 맛을 살린 작품도 있었다. 국내에서 신드롬을 일으켰던 ENA 수목드라마 ‘이상한 변호사 우영우’ (이하 ‘우영우’)는 센스 있는 자막으로 해외에서도 큰 화제를 모았다. 독일 국적의 한국 드라마 팬인 호프만(30)씨는 작품 속 주인공 우영우가 자신을 소개할 때 쓰는 문구인 똑바로 읽어도 거꾸로 읽어도 같은 단어들 (기러기, 토마토, 스위스, 인도인, 별똥별, 역삼역)의 영어 자막에 찬사를 보냈다. 호프만씨는 “몇 개의 에피소드를 본 뒤 우영우가 말하는 한국어 단어들이 영어 자막과는 다른 뜻을 가지고 있는 팰린드롬(palindrome)이라는 사실을 알았다. 아마 ‘우영우’를 본 해외 팬들은 나처럼 박은빈 배우가 말한 단어의 뜻이 무엇인지 찾아봤을 것이다”라고 말했다. “아마 몇 몇 해외 시청자들은 별똥별이라는 단어를 검색하고 웃었을 것이다”며 말맛을 살린 자막을 통해 한국어를 알아가는 즐거움을 전했다. 전문가와 업계 관계자들은 해외 시청자들이 언어의 장벽을 넘어서 한국 콘텐츠와 문화를 즐길 수 있도록 좀 더 다양한 방식을 모색해야 한다고 주장한다. 김경혜 상하이외국어대학교 부교수는 자막은 단순이 대사의 의미만을 전달하는 차원을 넘어서는 일을 할 수 있다고 말했다. 김 교수는 “'오징어 게임'에서 성기훈이 조상우에게 ‘쌍문동의 자랑. 쌍문동이 낳고 기른 천재. 서울대 경영학과 수석 입학 조상우’라고 말한다. 국내 시청자들은 이 대사만으로도 조상우가 어떤 인물인지 알 수 있지만 해외 시청자들은 왜 성기훈이 조상우를 여러 차례 이렇게 소개하는지 다소 의아할 수 있다”고 말했다. 김 교수는 만약 이와 관련된 자그마한 설명이 있었다면 작품을 보는 해외 시청자들도 조금 더 편하고 재미있게 ‘오징어 게임’을 즐길 수 있었을 것이라고 보았다. 다른 관계자들은 미국 OTT인 라쿠텐 비키처럼 팬들이 직접 자막을 만들어 달 수 있게 하거나 동영상을 시청하는 시청자들이 서로 소통하면서 작품을 감상할 수 있는 라이브 챗을 서비스 하는 것도 하나의 방법이 될 수 있다고 말했다. AI 기반 번역 스타트업 엑스엘에이트 (XL8)의 정영훈 대표는 자사의 AI 기술이 번역가들이 단순히 한국어를 해당 언어로 직역하는 단계를 뛰어넘어 현지 시청자들이 이해하기 쉽게 “로컬라이제이션 (localization)” 에 집중할 수 있는 기회를 가져와준다고 말했다. XL8는 문서에 쓰이는 문어체가 아닌 일상생활에서 쓰이는 구어체에 특화된 번역 서비스를 통해 전세계 글로벌 콘텐츠의 1/3 이상을 번역한다고 밝혔다. 정 대표는 “우선 저희가 학습시킨 AI 기반의 기계 번역 솔루션이 다국어로의 초벌 번역을 빠르게 처리합니다. 이후 각 언어별 전문가가 영상과 번역된 언어를 보며 문맥에 맞게, 현지에서 사용하는 언어에 맞게 번역이 잘 된 것인지 확인하고, 필요한 수정 등을 거쳐, 고객에게 결과물을 전달하게 된다”고 밝혔다. 그는 번역이 번역사의 창의성이 요구되는 주관적인 판단 영역이라 말하며, 현재 기계 번역 기술의 빠른 발전이 이 과정을 더욱 매끄럽게 할 것이라고 봤다. 현재 번역용 AI 기술은 고등학교 2학년 정도 수준에서 빠르게 학습하고 성장하고 있다고. “3-5년 정도 후에는 사람의 개입이 굳이 없어도 되는 엔진 성능이 되지 않을까 합니다. 그리고 난이도 및 필요에 따라서는 인간이 없어도 될 일이 늘어날 것이라 조심스레 추측해봅니다”고 전했다. 원문 [Hello Hangeul] The complications of the 'one-inch' barrier Experts and content industry insiders believe more can be done to offer greater cultural experience for international audiences Oscar-winning director Bong Joon-ho made headlines by using his acceptance speech at the 2020 Golden Globes to call on viewers to ""overcome the 1-inch barrier of subtitles to experience more amazing projects."" Two years later, Netflix’s “Squid Game” confirmed the arrival of Korean drama craze across the globe. With local projects picking up popularity on global streaming services, distributors are seeking to offer quality translation that allow the viewers to laugh and cry at all the right moments. Many Korean dramas and films have earned more-than-expected attention from the audience over the past few years, with fans from around the world discussing even the details of the subtitles. Recognizing its rising importance, content industry insiders continue efforts to provide quality subtitles. But they seem to fall short of satisfying the zealous, passionate Korean pop culture fans, who argue that several programs have dialogue that gets lost in translation. Issues seem minor, but noteworthy A month after the global release of ""Squid Game"" on Netflix, American comedian Youngmi Mayer, who is fluent in Korean, tweeted that the viewers may have watched a different series, if they watched the survival drama series with English subtitles. Mayer, a co-host of podcast ""Feeling Asian,"" emphasized problems with the translation of some of debt-ridden character Han Mi-nyeo's lines. The comedian explained that one of Mi-nyeo’s lines, in which she says “I am not a genius, but I still got it worked out. Huh,” actually means “I am very smart. I just never got a chance to study.” Mayer added that the line is a famous pun in Korean media and succinctly explains the character’s brash behavior. Mayer was commenting on closed caption subtitles -- designed for people who have difficulty hearing. These were based accurately on the transcript of the version of the drama with English-dubbing, which faces translation constraints because dialogue has to match each character's speaking time. Netflix also offers conventional subtitles with a more accurate translation, but critics pointed out that deaf and hearing-impaired viewers should also have access to well-translated subtitles. “I was a bit surprised to know that some famous Korean shows, which offer English subtitles, carry small mistranslations,” said a Taiwanese Disney+ viewer who wished to be identified by his surname Chen. “I learned from my Korean friend that the expression ‘kkolgabtteonda’ meant ‘don’t be so ridiculous’ or ‘don’t be such an ass!’ I didn’t know that it was a slang with a cynical nuance,"" Chen told The Korea Herald. ""Disney+’s ‘The Zone: Survival Mission’ translated that line into ‘give me a break,’” Chen said. He said that while not all of subtitles are mistranslated, he feels there is still room for improvement, especially as someone who takes an interest in Korean language and expressions. Meanwhile, some viewers expressed satisfaction for the Korean-to-English translation in various Korean content, including “Extraordinary Attorney Woo,” a legal drama series. Mentioning the iconic self-introduction of female lead Woo Young-woo (played by Park Eun-bin) -- “My name is Woo Young-woo, whether it is read straight or flipped. Kayak, deed, rotator, noon, racecar, Woo Young-woo” -- a 30-year-old German drama fan surnamed Hofmann felt the series’ Korean-to-English translation was more than satisfactory. “After a few episodes, I learned that what Woo was speaking in Korean meant goose, tomato, Switzerland, an Indian person and shooting star, which make palindromes in Korean. I think the translation, which holds different meaning to Park Eun-bin’s original line, made many fans to look up for the real definitions,” the drama fan said. “Many of them would have burst out laughing after realizing shooting star in Korean can also be shitting star,” Hofmann jokingly added. What is next for subtitles? Many experts and content industry insiders believe that various attempts can be made to allow global fans truly enjoy Korea's creative content and learn about the country’s culture. Kim Kyung-hye, a professor at Shanghai International Studies University, said that the role of subtitles can be expanded from merely providing literal translations. “Player 456, or Gi-hun (played by Lee Jung-jae), in ‘Squid Game’ repeatedly addresses Cho Sang-woo (played by Park Hae-soo) as a Seoul National University graduate and pride of Ssangmun-dong,” the professor said. “Korean viewers will have no problem understanding what it means to be an SNU graduate in Korea. But foreign viewers might wonder why the character is putting so much emphasis on that line in multiple episodes. A small explanation about the line could have been helpful to understand the series at a higher level,” Kim explained. Others think that the fan-oriented subtitles serviced on Rakuten Viki or the collaboration on subtitles with live chat service can be ways to expand intercultural understanding. In an attempt to enhance the viewer experience, many streaming platforms are embracing artificial intelligence to break the language barrier, quickly deliver accurate translation and allow wider audience to enjoy foreign projects to their fullest. Tim Jung, CEO of the AI machine translation front-runner XL8, explained that the subtitles created by his company allow the human translator to focus more on localization. “Post editing is done by human translators, allowing them to spend more time in making appropriate subtitles for different countries and their cultures,” Jung said via email. But he said that the current machine translation, which performs at a high school student level, will develop at a fast pace, making even the human translator in the post editing stage unnecessary in the next three to five years. “I agree that the art of translation still requires human creativity,"" said Jung, adding, ""But I predict that depending on the degree of difficulty and the need, there will be, in the future, more projects that do not require human translators.""",leejungjae,4.0,"The article mentions Lee Jung-jae specifically in reference to his role as Gi-hun (Player 456) in ""Squid Game,"" discussing how his character repeatedly references Cho Sang-woo's Seoul National University background.

In a pre-recorded interview, Lee, who won the Emmy Award for his role in ""Squid Game"" and successfully debuted as a director with the spy-action film ""Hunt,"" in which he also acts, said, “There is no such thing as one ‘jackpot’ in life. … You have to seize the small opportunities in life, to eventually seize that once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” Figure skating champion Kim received the Korea Image Cornerstone Award for “opening a new history of the country’s figure skating with her unrivaled performances.” She also received the Budding Youth Award in 2008.

He “emerged like a comet in the Korean swimming scene by setting a new Asian and Korean record,” according to the organizer. The Korea Image Stepping Stone Bridge Award was awarded to European fashion houses -- global luxury fashion brands such as Louis Vuitton, Burberry and Gucci -- in recognition of their roles in bridging Korea and the world. Ambassadors of the UK, Italy, France and the European Union jointly received the award. “There is enormous demand for Korea in general, especially in Europe, from music, food and handcraft,” EU Ambassador Maria Castillo Fernandez told The Korea Herald. “I believe in cultural diplomacy … Korea has to use more of the K-wave and use this momentum to be more multilateral.” British Ambassador to Korea Colin Crooks recalls being thought of as strange for wanting to learn Korean 30 years ago, but now ""all the young people want to know Korean, because it has become really fashionable,” he said. The ambassador added that along with the popularity of K-dramas, K-movies and K-pop, one of the most visible links between Korea and the UK are soccer players such as Son Heung-min and Hwang Hee-chan.

The film, nominated in 12 categories, took six trophies including best film, best director, best actor and best actress awards during the 43rd edition of the ceremony held at KBS Hall in Seoul, on Friday night.
The film revolves around a detective, played by Park Hae-il, who investigates a murder case where he suspects a mysterious widow, played by Tang Wei.
Director Park clinched best director for the film at this year’s Cannes Film Festival. The film has been selected as the country‘s entry for best international feature film for the 95th Academy Awards to be held next March.
“One good thing about being a director is that you have many opportunities to meet talented people in different fields,” Park said in his acceptance speech delivered by actor-comedian Kim Shin-young, who received the award on Park‘s behalf.
Park was unable to attend the ceremony as he is filming abroad. Kim starred in the film as a detective.
This marks Park’s third time winning the best director award at the Blue Dragon Film Awards, following “Joint Security Area” (2000) and “Oldboy” (2003).
Actor Park Hae-il was named best actor while Tang Wei nabbed best actress for their roles in the Cannes-winning film.
“I would like to share this joy with Tang Wei, who perfectly portrayed the role of Seo-rae. She made Hae-jun unable to get out of the beach forever,” said Park after expressing gratitude to director Park and screenwriter Jeong Seo-kyung.
Tang, speaking briefly in Korean before switching to English and Chinese, said, “Actors wait for that one good script and one character for months, years and even decades. I am very lucky to have met this character, Seo-rae.”

DDP, the long-time venue for the city’s fashion week, was bustling Tuesday to Saturday with Seoulites who came to see the shows or to show off their fashion flair. Some were trendy and some were outlandish, but all were eye-catching. The highlight of the first day of the country’s largest fashion event was the outdoor runway show by Songzio, which attracted almost 1,000 people. The 120-meter-long outdoor space was turned into a catwalk, on which star models including Cha Seung-won, Han Hye-jin and Bae Jung-nam strutted.  Gender-fluid clothing was central in many of the presentations, breaking down stereotypes about mens- or womenswear, as well as a binary conceptualization of men and women. Sling Stone, Sung Ju, Caruso, Songzio, Iryuk and Not Enough Words were some of the brands that played with the notion of gender-fluid dressing. Indeed, the gender-fluid look was seen among some men in attendance. Some were wearing pearl necklaces, a trend which seems to have caught on after Emmy-winning actor Lee Jung-jae appeared on a TV show wearing a pink jacket and a bold pearl necklace in the summer. At Sling Stone's show themed “Heaven on the Red Carpet” on Thursday, designer Park Jong-chul showed black and white clothing that included skirts and dresses worn by male models.  Taking the theme of “Between,"" Lim Wu-jun of Iryuk presented a genderless collection. A pair of white skirt-like pants paired with a navy jacket, oversized silhouettes and layered looks were part of the presentation. Korean traditional aesthetics informed several collections presented at Seoul Fashion Week. Rookie designer brand July Column presented a collection reinterpreting traditions and craftsmanship for contemporary tastes. The collection was inspired by paintings by Kim Jun-geun, an enigmatic 19th century artist. Designer Park Sooy's knitted hats were inspired by Korean traditional hats made with horsehair, called ""gat."" “The colors were inspired by the hues of traditional paintings – especially those from Kim’s paintings. We wanted to pay deep respect to the craftsmanship with hand-knitted hats, bags and jackets on which we collaborated with artisans,” designer Park Sooy told The Korea Herald after the show.  Sustainability continues to be an important practice in the fashion industry. Tibaeg claims it used recycled polyester material for 80 percent of the brand’s fabrics since its 2019 spring-summer collection. Designer Cho Eun-ae named the material “Polyester Mikado,” which became the brand's signature fabric. Cho collaborated with artist Kwon Jian for the magnolia flower paintings that were featured in the 2023 spring-summer collection. “The pandemic accelerated the trend of utilizing online platforms for fashion designers, presenting their collections at online showrooms. The channels for promoting one’s brand have also diversified, which made many fashion designers question the relevance of showing their collections in a physical runway show,” Cho said. “But a physical runway show is still important for us in showcasing the brand’s identity to people who want to see the collection in person. Runway shows are also a place to interact with clients and buyers,” she said. Veteran designer Lie Sang-bong chose to show his 2023 spring-summer collection off-venue at Dohwaseogil in Insa-dong, Jongno-gu, to commemorate the designer’s 37th anniversary.  Titled “Stone, Life and Universe,” the collection was shown on Wednesday and was created with eco-friendly printing techniques in collaboration with Epson Korea. Epson's digital textile printing machine allows direct printing on fabrics using far less energy and water compared to traditional methods of printing. At the same Insa-dong venue, the fashion designer’s archival exhibition “Re-flect 37” shows the history of the fashion brand Lie Sangbong, founded in 1985.

A day after his win, it was confirmed that Lee’s big-screen debut will be rereleased in local theaters on Sept. 29, offering fans a peak at the early days of the “Squid Game” star. The rerelease is not a mere attempt to cash in on Lee’s recent success, but is meant to commemorate the 40th anniversary of “The Young Man” director Bae Chang-ho’s debut. In an interview with local media, Bae reminisced on how he felt Lee epitomized the image of Generation X in Korea, as a free-spirited, ambitious young man not afraid of what other people thought of him. Lee’s performance in the flick won him recognition for best new actor at major film award shows, including Korea’s most prestigious Grand Bell Awards and Blue Dragon Film Awards. But his reputation as a thespian with a strong presence was not won overnight, with critics often viewing him as just another pretty face on the screen. Pretty face on quest to prove worth While Lee made a name for himself with his screen debut in 1994's hit TV drama “Feelings,” it was his subsequent appearance in a supporting role in 1995 drama “Sandglass” that earned him nationwide fame. His portrayal as a solemn bodyguard was a sensational hit, and there were floods of petitions to urge broadcaster SBS not to kill off his character. As Lee later admitted in interviews, his character trait as a man of few words was a directorial decision to mask his poor acting skills. The 22-year-old was baffled by the influx of accolades at the time, which he felt was not well earned. “I was cast as a fashion model while working at a coffee shop, then I shot a chocolate commercial, and got a gig in ‘Sandglass’ and ‘The Young Man.’ All this happened within a year and I was confused,” he said later in an interview in 2013, marking his career spanning 20 years. “I didn’t know how to act but I had work to do, so I made so many mistakes. It was embarrassing and stressful, so I decided to enlist to the military.” Still confused as to how he was able to win so many awards, Lee served his mandatory duties as noncombatant military personnel. Despite his personal doubts, Lee continued his winning streak with the critically acclaimed “City of the Rising Sun,” for which he won best actor at the Blue Dragon Film Awards and the Korean Association of Film Critics’ Awards. He also became lifelong friends with co-star Jung Woo-sung, who would go on to work with him on several projects in the decades to come. What followed, however, was nearly a decadelong slump in his television career, coupled with middling successes on the silver screen that were few and far between. After the success of “Squid Game,” Lee admitted in interviews that there had been times when he felt cornered, struggling between financial problems and a lack of good scripts. Impressive acting, impressive filmography  The 2010s marked a turning point for Lee’s career, starting with his appearance in 2010 thriller “The Housemaid.” In the film directed by Im Sang-soo, Lee played the authoritative patriarch, leaving an impression on the audience while playing opposite the internationally acclaimed Jeon Do-yeon and Yoon Yeo-jeong. Lee went continued his winning streak with heist film “The Thieves"" in 2012, featuring an ensemble cast consisting of big names like Kim Yoon-seok, Kim Hye-soo, Jun Ji-hyun and Kim Soo-hyun. It became the most financially successful Korean film at the time. It still remains No. 6 on the all-time Korean box office list. “The Thieves” director Choi Dong-hoon and co-star Jun would reunite with Lee in another smash hit film, “Assassination"" in 2015. The period piece portrayed the fictional assassination attempt on Japanese military leaders during Japan’s 1910-1945 colonization of Korea. Lee played another man caught between two worlds just two years earlier in crime-thriller “New World"" in 2013, where he portrayed an undercover cop having an identity crisis while his yearslong infiltration of the biggest corporate crime syndicate in the country. Despite sharing screen time with Choi Min-sik and Hwang Jung-min, considered among the most accomplished male actors in Korea, Lee’s performance was widely praised and his presence left a lasting impression on the audience. Lee shined in another period piece that opened the same year, opposite Song Kang-ho -- the eventual winner of the best actor award at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival -- in “The Face Reader"" in 2013 as the ambitious Prince Suyang, who overthrows his nephew, King Danjong, to ascend as king in the Joseon era. His first appearance in the flick occurs after over an hour of buildup about the treacherous prince, and is considered one of the most memorable entrances in Korean film. Marked by the bloody corpse of an animal he had just hunted, his scarred, menacing face appears with the monologue of the titular face reader on how Suyang has the face of a traitor. In 2017 and 2018, Lee played a minor but memorable role as the charismatic king of the underworld in the popular “Along With the Gods” trilogy, and played the menacing hit man in 2020’s “Deliver Us From Evil,” winning actor of the year at the local Asia Artist Awards. ‘Squid Game’ and beyond Despite his series of home runs on the big screen, Lee did not really have major success on TV, save a moderate hit as the lead for “The Aide: People Make the World Go Round” on JTBC in 2019. While Lee’s career as a film actor took him to new heights in the 2010s, the aforementioned series was the only TV show that he appeared on in the decade. That was, of course, before his unprecedented international success as the lead of “Squid Game” in 2021. He plays a debt-ridden man down on his luck who partakes in a precarious, deadly game in the show on Netflix, which was highly praised for its social satire and memorable characters, quickly becoming the platform’s most watched show ever. The show boosted Lee to international stardom, making him the first Korean to win for outstanding performance by a male lead actor in a drama series at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, outstanding lead actor in a drama series for Primetime Emmy Awards and a Golden Globes nomination. Lee’s global fame also landed him the lead role for the upcoming Disney+ series “Star Wars: The Acolyte,” although information about his character or the release date has not yet been released. What has been confirmed, of course, is Lee’s return as the lead for the second season of “Squid Game,” currently slated for 2024. At 49 years of age, the Korean movie star is now shooting for a new realm. At the Cannes Film Festival in March, Lee made his directorial debut with the espionage thriller “Hunt,” co-starring with his close friend Jung Woo-sung as rival agents in the Korean intelligence agency during the 1980s. The film received mostly favorable reviews following its Aug. 10 release in Korea, and is now the sixth highest grossing film of the year here. In a post-Emmys celebratory press conference for the cast of “Squid Game” on Friday, Lee said his biggest joy was that Korean content is being shared and beloved by the international audience. “Through writing the script for ‘Hunt’ and directing it, I also am beginning to meet with the international audience with Korean content in hand. Such meeting should occur more often in the future,” he said. “I think (we) need to think about how to introduce (to the world) more Korean movies and Korean dramas.”",leejungjae,5.0,"The article is entirely focused on Lee Jung-jae's career trajectory, from his debut in ""The Young Man"" through his Emmy-winning role in ""Squid Game.""

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2959168,[Newsmaker] Emmy-winning director Hwang says that ‘Squid Game 2’ is his next project,2022-09-16,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/09/16/20220916000529_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"His Emmy trophy for outstanding directing for a drama series in hand, director Hwang Dong-hyuk, the mastermind behind global phenomenon “Squid Game,” on Friday confidently entered a celebratory press conference following the Emmys win at the Westin Josun Seoul. At this stage, Hwang confirmed that his next project will be nothing other than a second season of “Squid Game.” “We will film the sequel next year and the series will likely be released in 2024. I am working on the script right now,” Hwang said. Hwang added that he had considered filming another movie with a working title “K.O Club,” also known as “Killing Old People Club,” but changed his plan to create the sequel of “Squid Game"" first. “If I film ‘Squid Game 2’ after making other films, the time gap between the first and second season will be too wide,” Hwang explained. “Also, actors including Lee Jung-jae will age too much, so I decided to do this project first,” he joked. Asked about the games to be played in the sequel, Hwang said it remains confidential. “I have decided all the games that I will include in the sequel, but I am sorry I cannot disclose them,” Hwang said. He then asked for the audience’s understanding, as he believes the games are key elements that make the series more entertaining.  “Following the characters who do not know what games they will play is what makes the series fun. If I tell you that now then it will reduce the fun. So, even if it accidentally slips out of my mouth when we drink or something, please just tell me to keep my mouth shut,” he added. The director also talked about bringing back some of the characters who died in the first season. “I really want to bring back Ji-yeong. And her close friend Sae-byeok died, too. I am not sure what I should do yet. So many players that were beloved by the audience all died. I did not know that we would be this successful and killed them without a second thought,” he said. Asked about the possibility of casting Hollywood actors in the sequel, Hwang said not in the near future. “I will consider that if we do the third season and the setting changes. But since the sequel will take place in Korea, I do not have plans to cast Hollywood actors,” Hwang replied. He added that he did joke with staff about asking Leonardo DiCaprio to appear in the show after hearing the Hollywood star was a fan of the series. “We talked about asking him: 'Will you join the game?'” he recalled. Along with Hwang, Siren Pictures CEO Kim Ji-yeon, actor Lee You-mi, art director Chae Kyung-sun, VFX supervisor Cheong Jai-hoon and stunt performers Shim Sang-min, Lee Tae-young and Kim Cha-i took part in the press conference. Before the Primetime Emmy Awards -- in which director Hwang and actor Lee Jung-jae each took home a trophy -- “Squid Game” also won four prizes at the Creative Arts Emmys on Sept. 5. It won outstanding guest actress in a drama series, outstanding special visual effects in a single episode, outstanding production design for a narrative contemporary program and outstanding stunt performance. Lee Jung-jae, who won the Emmy for outstanding lead actor in a drama series, could not participate in the event in Seoul as he was at the Toronto International Film Festival to premiere his directorial debut feature film, “Hunt.” Instead, he sent a prerecorded video to deliver his short Emmy Award acceptance speech. The video was presented during the press conference. “When my name was announced at the Emmys -- it was a short moment -- I could not believe that it was my name that was called,” he said. “Many fellow Korean actors sent me congratulatory messages and as I was replying to them I finally realized what has happened to me.” Lee added that he hopes many people are excited for the next season. Rookie actor Lee You-mi, who played Ji-yeong in the Netflix series, also talked about what it was like to win the Emmy for outstanding guest actress in a drama series. “This award gave me the courage and made me think that there are various roads that I can take as an actor. I became more open to that,” she said. The director also added that taking home the trophy was meaningful to him. “Tomorrow is the day that ‘Squid Game’ was released last year. It has been exactly 365 days and during that time I won many trophies and received lots of love. It was a memorable year for me,” Hwang said. However, not winning the best drama series award at the Emmys was a little disappointing to the director. “The entire staff and actors can all go up to the stage when you win the best drama series award. I longed for that moment. When they announced the winner, they start saying ‘S-' so I thought they are going to say ‘Squid Game’ but ‘Succession’ won the award to my disappointment,” Hwang said. The drama series scored 14 nominations, including for best drama series, at this year's Primetime Emmy Awards. The director also addressed the issue of his series being too violent for young kids during the press conference. “We should be able to freely make content with violent scenes and I think that is why we rate films,” Hwang said. He defended the violent scenes he has directed by saying they were necessary, as all of them reflect the violence of the system that exists in the real world, and he hopes the parents who decide to let their kids watch the show can take the time to talk about the scenes with their kids for better understanding.",leejungjae,5.0,"The article is highly relevant to Lee Jung-jae as it discusses his Emmy win for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for ""Squid Game"" and mentions his absence from the press conference due to premiering his directorial debut ""Hunt"" at TIFF.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2933526,K-dramas: The making of a global breakthrough,2022-08-14,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/08/12/20220812000241_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"A historical look at how Korean TV series went from local, occasionally regional, hits to reaching global critical mass Last month, Netflix revealed the list of its most-streamed TV shows of all time. “Squid Game,” which topped the list with 1.65 billion hours, also claimed the top spot in terms of the consecutive number of days it was ranked No. 1 worldwide. The global success of “Squid Game” is not only grounded in its quality and universal appeal, but also the existence of streaming platforms like Netflix that launched it and other local shows alike to an international audience. With “Squid Game,” it seems Korean dramas as a whole have put their stamp on global screens. Now, one show after another has been landing high on the streaming charts, with the most recent case being “Extraordinary Attorney Woo,” which topped Netflix’s most recent global non-English TV rankings tallied from July 25-31. A look at the history of K-dramas shows this wasn’t an overnight success. Korean producers spent decades honing their craft and trying to win over global audiences, at the vanguard of what would later be known as the Korean Wave, or Hallyu. Pre-2010s and fledgling Hallyu The 1990s marked a time when countries in the Far East started active cultural exchanges. Korea, a little late to the trend, lifted a ban on Japanese pop culture in 1998. This market opening, which at that time was met with worries that Japanese imports would stifle local content, planted the seed for the popularity of Korean drama and music that engulfed much of Asia in the following decade. Choi Gwang-sik, professor of Korean history at Korea University, compares Hallyu to the cultural exchange that took place between the East and the West via the Silk Road thousands of years ago. “There is an impression that Korean culture has been closed off (to the outside) but this is largely from the Joseon era that was based on an isolation policy. Korean culture has been in active contact with the outside world, and has evolved in a creative way,” he said during a recent lecture in Seoul. Through Hallyu, he said Korea went from a cultural importer to becoming an exporter, sharing with the world the country’s culture. Any attemp to track down the origin of K-drama’s success will lead to a popular TV series called “What is Love (1991).” News articles at that time reported of empty streets when it aired. The MBC drama, featuring a household centered around an authoritarian patriarch, has the highest viewership rating of all time at an average of 59.6 percent. The show’s popularity catapulted its cast to stardom, and its star Lee Soon-jae was even elected to a seat in the National Assembly in 1992. “What is Love” was the first Korean drama ever to be officially exported to China, being aired on China Central Television in 1997. Some say the show was the first case of Hallyu, years before the word was even coined. At that time, only the most sensational of shows were able to reach overseas audiences via formal rights sales, although some did so without official deals, as a result of content piracy. The first official use of the world Hallyu was recorded in 1999, when the government promoted the country’s most popular music on a CD with the title “Hallyu -- Song from Korea.” For the next few years, Hallyu became the talk of the town in the country, with both pundits and the media expressing high hopes for Korean cultural content. In the early part of the next decade, the 2000s, Hallyu really made landfall in Japan. Singer BoA was the first case of a Korean artist being subject to yearslong training with the general Asian market as the target, releasing her debut album in multiple languages -- all of which she is fluent in. This type of K-pop trainee system would later become the norm in K-pop. But what propelled Hallyu to the next level was the massive hit of the 2002 KBS drama “Winter Sonata,” starring Bae Yong-jun and Choi Ji-woo. Bae, in particular, enjoyed enormous popularity among Japanese female viewers, earning the nickname “Yonsama.” Bae and Choi were such household names in Japan that characters based on them even appeared in the popular Japanese manga “Crayon Shin-Chan.” Ironically, “Winter Sonata” was not the most popular drama in Korea at the time, or even of 2002. That title belonged to the SBS’ “Rustic Period” that aired in the second half of the year. The SBS series, which depicted gangsters from during the 1910-1945 Japanese colonization through 1970s, was the only Korean drama to surpass a 50 percent viewership all year, peaking at 57.4 percent. It enjoyed unexpected popularity in Mongolia, where its ratings reached north of 80 percent at one point. In 2009, local media reported that a Korean restaurant of the same name was set up in Mongolia, with the interior plastered with photos of the show’s star Ahn Jae-mo and episodes of “Rustic Period” being played 24/7. Another drama that had international success was “Temptation of Wife” in 2008 starring Jang Seo-hee. It was very popular in China and Mongolia, in particular, and led to the actor starring in several Chinese dramas. The SBS drama was the poster child of a new fad called “makjang drama,” characterized by extreme plot twists and controversial and sensational subject matter like betrayal, murder and extramarital affairs -- issues that Korean dramas had usually tiptoed around before then. Until the late 2000s, surpassing the 50 percent viewership mark was an achievable feat, although still somewhat uncommon. In 2010, the final episode of the KBS “Bread, Love and Dreams” was rated at 50.8 percent. This would be the last time viewership for any Korean drama passed the 50 percent mark, at least as of 2022. Change of tide Cable TV channels existed prior to the 2010s, but the disparity in scale ensured that big-budget dramas were monopolized by the three main TV broadcasters: SBS, MBC and KBS. Dramas cost billions of won to produce, and the fledgling cable broadcasters in the 2000s just did not have deep enough pockets. But in 2009, a series of law revisions allowed large conglomerates or news companies to own shares of broadcasting companies, giving birth to four general programming channels and one news network in 2011. This expanded the field for Korean dramas, and the number of channels that could spend big on dramas. But it was an already-existing cable network, tvN, that became one of the biggest players in Korean dram, with a series of successes like its “Reply” series in years 2012-2015 and 2016’s “Guardian: Lonely and Great God.” More widely known as “Goblin,” the Korean translation of its name, it became the first cable TV program to exceed a 20 percent viewership share with an average rating of 20.5 and a peak rating of 22.1 percent. The most popular drama of the year -- “Descendants of the Sun” -- was produced by KBS, but it clearly showed that dramas were no longer dominated solely by the big three. Both “Goblin” and “Descendants” were exported to other parts of Asia, with “Goblin” being aired in over a dozen regions including Hong Kong, the Philippines, Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam, Cambodia and parts of Europe and the Americas. Its international success was without the market in China, which banned Korean content due to Sino-Korean tensions at the time. “Descendants” was sold to China before the ban and was recorded to be the most popular Korean drama in the country at the time, and its remakes were aired in Taiwan and the Philippines. This year’s success of “Extraordinary Attorney Woo” is further proof that even a relatively-obscure player in the K-drama industry is capable of pulling off a global hit. The series was made by cable channel ENA, whose previous ratings record was 1.13 percent. “Woo“ took the top spot in the Netflix’s most recent global non-English TV rankings tallied from July 25-31, continuing a run of success by Korean dramas on the platform. Dafna Zur, an associate professor of East Asian Languages and Cultures at Stanford University, attributed the success of Korean dramas to their unique features that distinguish them from other countries. “Korean dramas strike a balance of predictability and originality. Their story arcs are often predictable: rags to riches, rich boy meets poor girl, children defy their parents’ wishes and strike out on their own. But they have a Korean twist,” Zur was quoted as saying in an interview. “Korean dramas humanize even the most aloof billionaires and get audiences to care -- and usually, all they ask of us is 16 hours of our time.” Global reach, new challenges The emergence of streaming platforms like Netflix has been the game changer for Korean dramas, in that it guarantees international exposure from the get-go, albeit just via certain membership-based platforms. This could mean Korean dramas could have a larger impact on the global stage. Earlier this year, “Squid Game” star O Yeong-su became the first Korean to win at the Golden Globes, while Lee Jung-jae and Jung Ho-yeon became the first Koreans to win Screen Actors Guild awards in the TV category. The show is also the first foreign series to be nominated for this year’s Emmy Awards, slated for September. But aside from global recognition, how much Korea is able to reap from the overseas success of its dramas has become a heated topic of debate. “Squid Game,” despite its explosive popularity across the world, didn’t deliver a windfall for its Korean producers, cast members or others that were involved in its making, as the IP rights belong to Netflix. As K-dramas extend its global reach, intellectual property rights emerged as an issue for its sustained success. Last December, local production studios launched what they called a “Creator Alliance” and vowed to work for the protection of IP. Instead of producing dramas via outsourcing of existing channels, the studios said they plan to create a joint fund to address financing problems.　 Korean dramas are conventionally funded by broadcasters and production is outsourced to local studios, as was the case with “Squid Game.” Since the IP rights of the series belong to the platform, it also receives most of any profit from the show, as was the case of other K-drama hits like “Hellbound” and “All of Us Are Dead.” Last month, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism revealed a four-year plan to spend a total of 4.8 trillion won ($3.66 billion) in financially supporting the production of streaming content. “Most profits from ‘Squid Game’ have been collected by Netflix who has its IP rights. There must be a way to stop relinquishing IP of our (Korea’s) content to the overseas platforms,” said Culture Minister Park Bo-gyoon. With Korean dramas enjoying their heyday, it remains to be seen whether or not the country will be able to fully cash in on their success.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2933856,"From ‘Shiri’ to ‘Parasite,’ Korean films came a long way",2022-08-13,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/08/11/20220811000308_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"“Squid Game” star Lee Jung-jae said he could not enjoy drinks with fellow actors and directors after the VIP screening event of his directorial debut film“Hunt” held on Aug. 2. He explained that it was because he had a Zoom meeting to promote the film to foreign fans the next morning. Lee’s film has been sold to 144 countries including France, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, Russia and Brazil, even before its local release on Aug. 11. “Tomorrow morning, I also have a meeting at 2 a.m.,” Lee said during an interview with a group of local reporters. Similar to Lee’s case, many Korean actors and filmmakers recently started promoting their works more actively to overseas moviegoers, as the global demand for Korean movies is rising.  Change did not happen overnight After director Bong Joon-ho won the Oscar for “Parasite” at the 92nd Academy Awards in 2019, South Korean cinema also brought home two trophies from this year’s Cannes Film Festival -- best director for Park Chan-wook of “Decision to Leave” and best actor for Song Kang-ho of “Broker.”　 These award-winning films and actors did not appear out of thin air. Korean film’s history of overseas expansion began around the early 2000s, when “Shiri”(1999) directed by Kang Je-kyu became a box office hit in Japan. Around that time, director Im Kwon-taek’s “ChunHyang” (2000) became the first South Korean film to be selected to compete for Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Around 2010, major Korean directors who gained global recognition expanded their global fanbase further by doing projects in the US with Hollywood star actors. Park Chan-wook who won the Grand Prix for “Oldboy” (2003) at the 2004 Cannes and the Jury Prize for “Thirst” (2009) at the 2009 Cannes, presented his English-language debut film “Stoker” starring actors Mia Wasikowska and Nicole Kidman in 2013. Star director Kim Jee-woon also made his US debut with the action thriller “The Last Stand” featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger in the lead in 2013. Before creating this film, Kim gained worldwide recognition through the horror film “A Tale of Two Sisters”(2003), the actioner “The Good, The Bad, The Weird” (2008) and the thriller “I Saw the Devil” (2010). “Parasite” director Bong Joon-ho created his Hollywood debut feature “Snowpiercer” in 2013 as well. The film featured top Hollywood stars Tilda Swinton, Chris Evans and Jamie Bell, along with Song Kang-ho, who also performed in Bong’s “Parasite.” Many Korean actors started joining Hollywood projects around 2010. Veteran Korean actor Lee Byung-hun performed Storm Shadow character in the 2009 picture “G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra.” He also played the same character in its sequel “G.I. Joe: Retaliation” in 2013 In 2015, actor Lee continued his strides in Hollywood by starring in “Terminator: Genesis” as the new villain T-1000. Actor Bae Doo-na’s Hollywood career began with Lana and Andy Wachowski’s “Cloud Atlas” (2012). After the first project, Bae also worked with Wachowski siblings for the film “Jupiter Ascending” (2015) and the Netflix series “Sense 8.”   Still a long way to go? Although many Korean films and actors started getting global recognition, the amount that most Korean films earn from the overseas market is still insignificant. During Lee Jung-jae’s interview, he noted that although his film “Hunt” has been sold to 144 countries, the total earnings from foreign sales of the film are very small, without giving a specific figure. According to KOFIC’s data, the total amount for exports of movies was $43,033,018 last year, a decrease of 20.5 percent from the previous year. The export amount in 2021, which includes both movie-related technology and movie export amount, only accounts for 5.5 percent of the total film industry sales amount, according to the same data. Film critic Jung Ji-wook said this is why some Korean filmmakers are more eager to create a movie that can appeal to mainly local audiences. “If you look at recently released movies like ‘Hansan.’ Its poor Japanese lines clearly show that it is targeted for only Korean audiences,” he said. Jung believes that when filmmakers become too dependent on domestic ticket sales, it can easily lead them to make cliche content. “It can hinder diverse stories from being created, and filmmakers will keep working with the same actors,” he said. However, film industry critic Yoo Tae-hee, also known as YouTuber Tuna, thinks simply trying to increase foreign sales can not be a solution. While increasing the portion of foreign sales can work as a safety net for some movies, it can not improve the quality of Korean movies for the future of our film industry, he said. Yoo added that there are also risks as foreign countries can decide to change import policies. “In particular, in the case of China, the future looks even more uncertain as it can move toward closing its doors ,” he told The Korea Herald.

For some moviegoers, the long-awaited reunion of top actors Lee Jung-jae – who also stars in the film -- and Jung Woo-sung is enough to hold their expectations high for the movie. Lee seemed a little nervous when he introduced himself as a director for the first time in his 23-year career during a press conference at Megabox Coex in Gangnam-gu, southern Seoul, on Thursday. But he said he believed that the mesmerizing performances of the starring actors are presented to their fullest in the espionage action film. “Many changes have been made from the original script. I thought deeply about what to keep and throw away. I remember spending a lot of time in choosing the theme of the film,” the actor-turned-director said. Lee hoped to choose a theme that can many audiences could relate to. After careful consideration, he decided to feature South Korea in the 1980s as the backdrop, a period of political upheaval. “Hunt” revolves around two elite agents at the Agency for National Security Planning, Park Pyung-ho (played by Lee) and Kim Jung-do (played by Jung Woo-sung), who are chasing after a North Korean spy leaking top secrets. Starting from the South Korean president’s visit to Washington in 1983, to a spy operation in Tokyo, the agents go head-to-head in an intense competition, a battle to prove their loyalty for the country and its leader.　 With their growing obsession to hunt down the spy, the agents start to suspect and monitor each other. “‘Hunt’ gave me an opportunity to learn that I am still able to present an exciting confrontation with Lee,” actor Jung said. “Watching him (Lee) fulfilling his duty as the director, I felt sorry for him. He was losing weight and becoming tired. But Lee definitely made all the actors feel like they could rely on him, while carrying out his responsibilities,” Jung added. The newly debuted director said that he wanted his movie to be a little different from other projects. “I am not a big fan of tear-jerking scenes, so I tried to minimize an emotional approach to the characters. The characters showed their thoughts and beliefs through historical background and their respective dilemmas,” the director explained. Lee and Jung, whose decadeslong friendship traces back to the 1999 drama film “City of The Rising Sun,” agreed that their attitude toward and passion for film have not changed despite not having worked together for 23 years. “Our goal has remained the same. We want to make a ‘good’ film,” Lee said. “There is a small difference, to be honest. Considering our age, we easily get tired after four or five takes,” Lee jokingly added. The top actors agreed that as they have become veterans, they feel more responsibility for their performances. They also have more discussions about the future, searching for ways to improve and grow the Korean movie industry.

The sci-fi action fantasy ""Alienoid"" will hit local theaters July 20, opening the largely all-Korean competition for the season. The new film by popular filmmaker Choi Dong-hoon, who has made many smash-hit films, including ""The Thieves"" (2012) and ""Assassination"" (2015), depicts two parallel worlds of the 14th and 21st centuries that start to connect with each other as the gates of time travel open due to a mysterious force. It is one of the most anticipated films in the summer vacation season for its star-studded cast, including Kim Tae-ri, Kim Woo-bin, Ryu Jun-yeol and So Ji-sub, and crew members, including production designer Lee Ha-jun of ""Parasite"" (2019). The new historical war film ""Hansan,"" directed by Kim Han-min, will premier a week later. The second installment of Kim's trilogy about battles led by Adm. Yi Sun-sin depicts the historical Battle of Hansan Island on the southern coast of Korea in July 1592. It is one of the biggest victories that the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) pulled off against Japan during the country's Invasion of Korea (1592-1598). It is highly expected to continue the bullish run by its predecessor, ""Roaring Currents"" (2014), the most-watched film in Korean box-office history with more than 17 million moviegoers. Next is the aviation-disaster movie ""Emergency Declaration,"" set to be released Aug. 3. Starring Cannes-winning actors Song Kang-ho and Jeon Do-yeon, the film by Han Jae-rim tells a story about a flight from Seoul to Honolulu and its captain who declares an emergency declaration after a deadly virus planted by an unknown terrorist kills a passenger. It was one of the official selections of the 2020 Cannes Film Festival, whose physical edition was canceled due to the pandemic, but its release has been postponed for more than two years. On Aug. 10, ""Squid Game"" star Lee Jung-jae's directorial debut ""Hunt"" will open in local theaters after premiering at this year's Cannes. Starring Lee and Jung Woo-sung, the espionage film is a story about two rival intelligence agents in South Korea, Park Pyong-ho (Lee) and Lee Jung-do (Jung), who separately chase after a North Korean spy leaking top secret information that could jeopardize national security. The two end up discovering a plot to assassinate the South Korean president. Insiders expect the four blockbusters to accelerate the ongoing upbeat cycle at the local box office led by the Korean action comedy ""The Roundup"" in the spring. Released in May, the sequel to the 2017 hit ""The Outlaws"" had garnered a total of 12.5 million admissions as of Tuesday, becoming the 14th most-watched film of all time in Korea. The number of moviegoers reached 15.5 million in June, rising nearly back to the pre-pandemic level. It is the highest monthly figure since the 16.84 million from January 2020 -- the last full month before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.

The two top movie stars, who became close while filming “City of the Rising Sun” (1999), directed by Kim Sung-soo, have long been showing off their friendship on and off the screen. At a press conference to introduce his upcoming “Hunt” at Megabox Seongsu in Seoul on Tuesday, Lee said he had to ask his best friend to take the role four times before he finally accepted. At the press conference, Jung explained that he was careful about working with Lee again after more than two decades because he knew the public’s expectations would be high. Lee and Jung both agreed that the original script, written four years ago, was not good enough, and lots of changes had to be made. “I tried to read the script as objectively as possible. He (Lee) put a lot of effort into changing the script and felt like it was finally ready,” Jung said. “Hunt” is set in the 1980s. Lee appears in the movie as Park Pyung-ho, an elite agent at the Agency for National Security Planning on the trail of a North Korean spy. During his chase, he becomes increasingly aware of his own country’s dark truths. Meanwhile, another elite agent named Kim Jung-do (played by Jung) starts to suspect that Park is a North Korean spy. “I was so nervous handing the script to actors and asking them to join the project,” Lee said. “I wanted them to join because the work is good, not because of our friendship, so I was nervous.” In the beginning, Lee said he only planned to be the film’s producer. When the actor found out that the project had hit obstacles, and that some changes had to be made to the original script, he started to consider directing.  “I was not sure if I am qualified to be a director. I have been doing movies for a long time, but writing a script and directing was completely different. But I decided to muster up the courage and do it,” Lee said. Jung said he closely watched Lee work hard on the new movie as both an actor and the director and thought, “My friend is going to die on the set.” “He (Lee) was already tired after playing his character, but he still had to focus on work as a director. He was not done after filming his scenes, he had a lot of decisions to make and also prepare for the next shooting,” Jung said. At the press conference, Lee thanked Jung for encouraging him while working on the set. “Jung Woo-sung has experience directing ‘Guardian.’ He had some hard time back then and I gave him ginseng extract. This time, when we were working on ‘Hunt,’ Jung gave me wild ginseng extract,” Lee joked. “Guardian” is set to be released later this year. Lee also talked about the film debuting as a midnight screening in the noncompetitive section of the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year. “Cannes loves Korean movies, and it is a familiar film fest for Koreans. It was great that they invited my movie,” Lee said. “I talked about Korean films and promoted our film while I was there.” Two other actors in the film -- Heo Sung-tae, who plays agent Kim’s subordinate, and Jeon Hye-jin, who plays agent Park’s subordinate -- talked about their experiences working on the highly anticipated project. “I remember meeting Lee Jung-jae for the first time on the ‘Squid Game’ set. It was in front of an elevator,” Heo, who also starred in “Squid Game,” said. “At that time, I did not imagine myself working with these two actors (Lee and Jung). I felt like I was dreaming of filming with them.” Jeon said it was interesting to see both director Lee and actor Lee on the set. “I could tell by his look,” Jeon said. “When he directed he wore sweatpants and sneakers. He wore the same thing all the time. And when he performed as Pyung-ho, his attitude totally changed. I could talk to director Lee very freely, but not Pyung-ho.”",leejungjae,5.0,"The article is highly relevant to Lee Jung-jae as it focuses on his directorial debut film ""Hunt,"" in which he also stars.

At the Academy Awards last year, Youn was named Best Actress in a Supporting Role for the livewire grandmother role in the American immigration film ""Minari"" (2020), becoming the first South Korean to win an acting Oscar. About a year later, she stars in the latest Apple TV+ original series ""Pachinko,"" based on the namesake novel written by Korean-American author Min Jin Lee. The eight-part epic family saga follows Sunja who has to go through a tough life in Japan-occupied Korea and in Japan after the Second World War. While ""Pachinko,"" co-directed by Korean-Americans Kogonada and Justin Chon, has won rave reviews from critics and viewers, Youn's performance as older Sunja, who lives in Japan as a Zainichi, a Japanese word for ethnic Koreans who have permanent residency status in Japan but don't have Japanese passports, has been also critically acclaimed. ""Youn benefits from a liberal expansion of Sunja's story from the last third of the book, and no actor so conveys the polar extremes of the material's sadness and ebullience, sometimes with precious little dialogue,"" Hollywood Reporter said in its review of ""Pachinko."" Based on her presence in ""Pachinko,"" she has emerged as a strong contender for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in the upcoming Primetime Emmy Awards, the most prestigious honor for primetime television programming in the US According to Gold Derby, an American awards prediction website, Youn placed ninth in the drama supporting actress category as of Thursday, up from 12th about three weeks earlier. Sarah Snook of ""Succession"" and Julia Garner of ""Ozark"" are leading the race. ""If 'Pachinko' finds similar popularity after accruing that unanimous critical praise, it is likely that Youn will be recognized for her affecting work yet again,"" said Gold Derby. If she clinches the trophy, she will become the first South Korean to win both an Oscar and an Emmy. At the same time, the breakout hit Netflix original ""Squid Game"" will likely have multiple nominations at this year's Emmys including best drama series, best actor and best supporting actress. The survival drama runs second in the Outstanding Drama Series category after ""Succession"" on Gold Derby's latest Emmy prediction chart. ""Squid Game,"" an all-Korean show presented by US streamer Netflix, has won multiple nominations and trophies at preceding awards ceremonies including the Critics Choice Awards and the Screen Actors Guild Awards. Its lead Lee Jung-jae placed third in the competition for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, while Jung Ho-yeon is the third biggest favorite for best drama supporting actress. A nomination by an actor or a program at the Emmys will make history as no Koreans or Korean-made TV series have competed for the US awards given by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (ATAS) to outstanding American TV shows.

A total of 18 contenders were listed in this category on Thursday. “At Cannes this year, I’m going to watch as many films as I can. I am also ready to give a longer standing ovation than anybody,” Park said in a statement. Park’s new movie centers on a polite and honest police officer named Hye-jun (Park Hye-il). Hye-jun looks into a suspicious death that occurred on a mountain and comes to suspect the dead man’s wife, the mysterious Seo-rae (Tang Wei). At the same time, Hye-jun becomes attracted to her. The script of “Decision to Leave” was co-written with Jeong Seo-kyeong, with whom Park has worked on multiple films, including “I’m a Cyborg, but That’s OK” (2006), “Thirst” (2009) and “The Handmaiden” (2016). “Broker” is Kore-eda’s first Korean movie. The Japanese director, who won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2018 for “Shoplifters,” wrote and directed the new Korean film and worked with CJ ENM, the entertainment unit of South Korean conglomerate CJ Group, which financed and produced the project. It features famous Korean actors including Song Kang-ho, Bae Doo-na, Gang Dong-won and IU. “Parasite” star Song and “Oldboy” director Park, who worked together on “Thirst” in 2009, will be competing against each other this year.

The Korean director Park was also awarded the Grand Prix, the second-highest prize at the festival, for his thriller “Old Boy” in 2004. Bong Joon-ho’s “Parasite” starring Song grabbed the highest honor at the Cannes Film Festival in 2019. Both Park and Kore-eda’s films are set to hit local theaters in June. Actor-turned-filmmaker Lee’s spy thriller “Hunt,” staring Korean heartthrob Jung Woo-sung, was invited to screen at the Midnight Screening, a non-competitive section of the festival. Lee also appears in the movie as one of the leading actors. Set in the 1980s, elite agent Park Pyung-ho (Lee) works at the Agency for National Security Planning and got a mission to chase after a North Korean spy. While doing that he becomes increasingly aware of his own country’s dark truths. “It’s a great honor to have my directorial debut feature screened at Cannes,” Lee said in a statement.

The series was nominated in four categories. Two actors -- Jung Ho-yeon and Lee Jung-jae -- won awards for their roles. This marked the second consecutive year of Korean actors winning at least one SAG award. Last year, veteran actor Youn Yuh-jung won for her role as a feisty grandmother in the film “Minari.” Jung, who played Sae-byeok, a North Korean defector who participates in the bloody survival game to win 45.6 billion won ($38.9 million) in the Netflix series, won the award for outstanding performance by a female actor in a drama series. The series marked her debut as an actor. She is better known in Korea as a model. At the awards ceremony, Jung began her acceptance speech in Korean, expressing gratitude toward other actors at the event, adding that she was honored to be there with people she looks up to. Then she started speaking in English with tears in her eyes. “Thank you make me dream and open the door for me. And I love you ‘Squid Game’ crew,” Jung said in her acceptance speech. Jung was nominated in the category alongside Jennifer Aniston for “The Morning Show,” Elisabeth Moss of “The Handmaid‘s Tale,” Sarah Snook of “Succession” and Reese Witherspoon of “The Morning Show.”  Top star Lee, who played Gi-hun, a down-on-his-luck middle-aged man who also takes part in the deadly “Squid Game,” was named the winner for outstanding performance by a male actor in a drama series. “Oh my, thank you so much. This is truly huge,” Lee said during his acceptance speech in Korean. “Thank you SAG Awards. And thank you to the global audience for all of your love for ‘Squid Game.’” Lee was nominated along with Brian Cox of “Succession,” Billy Crudup of “The Morning Show,” Kieran Culkin of “Succession” and Jeremy Strong of “Succession.” The outstanding action performance by a stunt ensemble in a comedy or drama series prize also went to “Squid Game” on Monday. Other works that were nominated in the category were “Cobra Kai,” “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,” “Loki” and “Mare of Easttown.” The Korean drama series was also listed for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series, but “Succession” took home that prize. Director Hwang Dong-hyuk’s “Squid Game” is a story about hundreds of cash-strapped players who risk their lives to compete in children’s games where the final winner gets 45.6 billion won. Following its release in September, it quickly became the most-watched Netflix show of all time, reaching the No. 1 spot on the show charts of 94 countries. The “Squid Game” team also won multiple awards at other US awards events. In January, veteran actor Oh Young-soo, who portrayed player No. 1 in “Squid Game,” took home the best performance by a supporting actor in a series, limited series, or television movie trophy at the 79th Golden Globe Awards. In November, the show won the breakthrough series long format category at the 2021 Gotham Awards. Also, the American Film Institute selected “Squid Game” as one of the three winners of a special honor in December 2021. “Belfast” and “Summer of Soul” were also recognized as “works of excellence that fall outside of the Institute’s criteria of American film and television” along with “Squid Game.”",leejungjae,5.0,"The article is highly relevant to Lee Jung-jae as it directly covers his significant achievement of winning the SAG Award for outstanding performance by a male actor in a drama series for his role as Gi-hun in ""Squid Game.""

""We are living in a society where people dare to tread on other people to survive,"" he said Wednesday in a pretaped interview by the Seoul-based Corea Image Communication Institute. ""But I still believe that this society doesn't have to be one where we need to kill others and override them to go up.""

The awards show, which takes place at 11 a.m., Monday (Korean time) is being neither broadcast nor streamed live. The boycotts come despite the Hollywood Foreign Press Association attempts to respond to criticisms over lack of diversity. This year’s nominations include several actors and projects of diverse backgrounds, including Korean actors Lee Jung-jae and Oh Yeong-soo competing for the best television actor and best supporting actor prizes, respectively. The nine-part thriller “Squid Game” was also nominated for the best drama series.

Considered one of the two biggest US film honors alongside the Academy Awards, the Golden Globe Awards has come under fire over allegations of racism and sexism. The annual event faced a boycott from film studios and stars in Hollywood, including Tom Cruise, who returned the Golden Globe trophies he had won over the years. An ethics controversy and criticism over lack of diversity were brought to the fore when “Minari” won the best foreign-language film at the 2021 Golden Globe Awards. The film by Korean American director Lee Isaac Chung could not compete in the best drama, musical or comedy category, because the Golden Globe Awards rules categorized the film, most of whose dialogue was spoken in Korean, as a foreign-language film. The film was produced by American production company Plan B and New York-based film distributor A24. The previous eligibility rules for the best foreign-language film stated that any film in which at least 51 percent of its dialogue was not in English must be entered into the foreign language category. This prevented the project from competing in the best drama, musical or comedy category, which was exclusive to English-language motion pictures.

The Hollywood Foreign Press Association on Monday announced the nomination of Netflix’s South Korean megahit in three categories at 79th Golden Globes -- actors Lee Jung-jae in best television actor in the drama series, Oh Young-soo in best supporting actor and “Squid Game” in the best drama series. “Squid Game” also earned three nominations at 27th Critics Choice Awards. The series is competing for best drama and will also be competing for best foreign language series. Lee Jung-jae, who plays Seong Gi-hun on the show, will vie for best actor in a drama series against Sterling Brown of NBC’s “This Is Us,” Mike Colter of Paramount+’s “Evil,” Brain Cox and Jeremy Strong of HBO’s “Succession” and Billy Porter of FX’s “Pose.” “Squid Game” wrote the first chapter of new TV history with the win in the breakthrough series’ long format category at the 2021 Gotham Awards in November. In his acceptance speech, director Hwang Dong-hyuk, who was behind the Korean thriller, said that winning an award in the international stage and becoming the first Korean series to win at Gotham Awards was a “miracle.” However, that miracle was a signal of things to come.

The award ceremony took place on Tuesday in New York and “Squid Game” director Hwang Dong-hyuk, Siren Pictures CEO Kim Ji-yeon and two cast members -- Lee Jung-jae and Jung Ho-yeon -- were on stage when the award was given out. “We’ve experienced so many miracles since we launched this show on Sept. 17 and the biggest of them is how much love and support you all have shown to a foreign language series with a very strange title,” Kim said during her acceptance speech. Hwang, who wrote the script in 2009, said he had tried his best at the time but no one appreciated it. “People said it’s unrealistic, it’s too violent, it’s absurd, it’s weird. It took 12 years to make this show and show it to the people. And it took less than 12 days to become the number one show on the planet,” Hwang said. “What can I say? It’s a miracle.

Starting in late fall, the highly competitive race for great TV shows and movies of the year is the biggest celebration for the US entertainment industry eying for the Emmys and Oscars next year. In the past two years, the American awards season unprecedentedly caught the eyes of Korean people, as Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite"" swept the awards-positioning fall film festivals and the eventual Academy Awards and Youn Yuh-jung of ""Minari"" brought home the first acting Oscar. This year, Netflix's Korean-language original ""Squid Game"" will be the next player that will gain huge attention not only from Korea but from all over the world. Written and directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk, the nine-part series about contestants competing in deadly Korean children's playground games to win 45.6 billion won ($38.5 million) in prize money became a global phenomenon, as it was viewed by a record 142 million households over the first four weeks of its release on Sept. 17. Last month, the organizers of the 2021 Gotham Awards nominated the Korean-language Netflix original drama ""Squid Game"" for two categories -- Breakthrough Series - Long Format (over 40 minutes) and Outstanding Performance in a New Series for its lead Lee Jung-jae. The awards for lower budget films and TV series are considered the beginning of the harvest season, and its winners are dubbed key precursors for subsequent awards shows. Since then, US media outlets have increased the odds of ""Squid Game"" winning a good number of recognitions in big-name accolades, including the Critics Choice Awards and the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards. According to Gold Derby, an American awards prediction website, ""Squid Game"" has been included in its top five candidates for the SAG Awards TV drama ensemble prize, along with HBO's black comedy ""Succession,"" Apple TV+'s drama ""The Morning Show,"" Hulu's ""The Handmaid's Tale"" and FX's ""Pose."" ""If 'Squid Game' makes the final five, a win is definitely not out of the question,"" said Gold Derby, adding the SAG has given its top prizes in TV and film to popular hits of the year, such as ""Grey's Anatomy."" It will be the first Korean-language TV series to compete for the award given by US actors if ""Squid Game"" gets nominated for SAG's top best ensemble prize, or officially Outstanding Performance by a Cast. The cast of the Oscar-winning ""Parasite"" (2019) clinched the SAG's top prize for film, while Youn Yuh-jung won Outstanding Performance By a Female Actor in a Supporting Role for her performance in the immigration film ""Minari"" (2020). The nominations list of the SAG Awards will be announced on Jan. 12, with the award ceremony set for Feb. 27. IndieWire also forecast the Korean drama will get a berth for the Producers Guild of America (PGA) Awards and the Critics Choice Awards, adding Netflix has confirmed the show will compete in Drama Series categories, not Limited Series, at upcoming awards shows, including next year's Emmys. Against this backdrop, the US streaming giant is moving fast to ride on the industry-wide expectations for its global sensation ""Squid Game."" Netflix held a special event for screening of the series for industry people in Hollywood on Monday, along with creator Hwang and actors Lee, Park Hae-soo and Jung Ho-yeon.

Earlier, Hwang Dong-hyuk, the director and writer “Squid Game,” had said that there would be a second season of the dystopian drama during a special screening and Q&A with reporters in Los Angeles on Tuesday. The creator told the reporters through a translator that there will be “Squid Game Season 2.” “So there has been so much pressure, so much demand and so much love for a second season. So I almost feel like you leave us no choice. I will say there will indeed be a second season. It’s in my head right now.

Items from the drama caught the attention of viewers, resulting in dalgona-making kits being sold on eBay. Dalgona, a type of Korean honeycomb, was enjoyed by countless TikTok users. The green tracksuit and pink jumpsuit inspired numerous Halloween costumes this year. The games, enjoyed by Korean children in the 1970s and the 1980s, attracted viewers across generations who created parodies and memes in both online channels and television programs in Korea and countries around the world.

Last week, Bucket Studio hit the price ceiling on both Thursday and Friday, and rose 2 percent Monday. Its market cap approached 200 billion won ($170 million) as of Monday’s closing, up from 114 billion won as of Sept. 17. Bucket Studio began garnering investor attention because the company is a minority shareholder of Artist Company, holding 15 percent ownership. Artist Company is home to actor Lee Jung-jae, who played protagonist Seong Gi-hun in the nine-episode Battle Royale-style survival drama series “Squid Game.” But some fared worse due to the heightened volatility of the stocks. Showbox, a media company dedicated to film investment, production and distribution, fell over 10 percent Monday, soon after the company saw its stock price soar more than 50 percent from Thursday to Friday. The volatility comes after earlier reports said Showbox, the media arm of the Orion conglomerate, had financed a film production by “Squid Game” producer Siren Pictures in its early stages. Siren Pictures said Showbox’s financing had nothing to do with “Squid Game.” The sudden upshot follows the surge in popularity for “Squid Game,” which topped the global Netflix chart last week after its release. Analysts say the investor attention on Korean media stocks is unlikely to be short-lived. The poised launch of Disney+ in Korea in November will intensify the race among global streaming service providers to secure Korean content and ramp up spending at Korean media firms to create original productions. Its maiden voyage will start with a drama series produced by Next Entertainment World, titled “Our Police Course.” Alongside Netflix and Disney+, Apple TV+ and HBO Max is also eyeing a launch into the Korean market. Against this backdrop, Korean content production firms, especially small and medium-sized companies such as Astory, Next Entertainment World and Samhwa Networks are likely to be beneficiaries. Oh Tae-wan, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities, said Korean media firms enjoy increased profit margins on heightened anticipation for “global over-the-top media firms’ appetite for spending in Korea.” Oh maintained an “overweight” rating for stocks in Korean media and advertisement sectors.

With an attempt to create a Korean version, I started planning out the work in 2008 and finished the scenario in 2009,” the director said in an online press conference Wednesday. “However, casting actors and getting investment were extremely difficult during these periods. The idea of a game winner who strikes it rich was unwelcomed. The brutality and cruelty of the games were of concern. I had to put the scenario on the shelf.” 　 More than a decade later, interest in survival games and cryptocurrency picked up. ""Unlike 2009, many people were fascinated by the script and I decided to expand the original scenario to shoot a Netflix series,” Hwang added. Director Hwang’s Netflix debut, “Squid Game,” revolves around hundreds of cash-strapped players accepting an unexpected invitation to compete in various children’s games for a tempting prize of 45.6 billion won ($39 million). The competitors, faced with a life-changing opportunity, find out that each game puts their lives at stake. Taking place at an undisclosed site, the contestants are prohibited from leaving the premises until a final winner is declared. Asked why he chose Squid Game for the title of his upcoming series, Hwang said it is the most physical game and his personal favorite among many childhood games. “I thought the game was a perfect metaphor of our highly competitive society. So ‘Squid Game’ was a perfect name for this series,” Hwang added. Veteran actor Lee Jung-jae, taking on the role of debt-ridden and divorced man Ki-hoon, shared his anticipation for the series’ debut. “Because I always wished to work with Hwang, I was thrilled to hear about his offer. As I read through the scenario, I found the changes in emotions and personality of individual characters in an extreme situation captivating,” Lee said. “Ki-hoon was an interesting character to play. Though he faces countless struggles in his life, Ki-hoon is very optimistic and humorous, and able to make friends in a life-threatening survival game. I was surprised to see how I portrayed Ki-hoon,” Lee added. Though the game was set in a fictional world, co-star Park Hae-soo said it evoked real emotions. “When I participated in the game Red Light, Green Light as Sang-woo, Ki-hoon’s childhood friend, the drama set was filled with all contestants. However, as I watched people die after fierce competition, I was left with many things to think about,” Park said. The director hoped fans are able to find relief from the pressures they face and be free from the competition in their daily lives by watching the series.

The upcoming film stars Hwang Jung-min and Lee Jung-jae, and is currently topping real-time ticket reservations. With tentpole films from major distributors towing the box office, recent months have seen a steady rise in the number of cinemagoers, rising from an all-time monthly low of 972,000 in April to 5.62 million in July with the start of the peak summer season. Although the numbers have shown a steep upward climb, cinemas are far from their old normal. According to KOFIC data, the overall number of moviegoers in the first half of this year plummeted by 70.3 percent compared to the same period last year. Although July’s figure stood at the highest since the fallout from COVID-19, the figure was an all-time low box office number for July since the agency started compiling such data in 2004. “Most people are still wary of activities in public spaces due to the COVID-19 situation. Although big titles are opening, we’re still very cautious in promoting films and ushering in people to the cinemas,” head of CGV’s communications team Hwang Jae-hyeon told The Korea Herald. The lack of foreign summer blockbusters that typically pull in large audience figures is another factor contributing to the slow recovery. Four of the most popular films in July last year were all from Hollywood: “Spider-Man: Far From Home,” “The Lion King,” “Aladdin” and “Toy Story 4.” “In the case of this summer, although the local distributors are starting to release their tentpole films, most of the highly anticipated foreign film releases have been canceled or postponed indefinitely. The absence of such films that can attract moviegoers is considerable,” a public relations official from Lotte Cinema said. Yet cinema operators have higher hopes for August. “With ‘Deliver Us From Evil’ as a start, we have at least one new Korean film opening every week this month, and on Aug. 26, Christopher Nolan’s ‘Tenet’ will hit theaters. We anticipate ticket sales to recover to up to at least 50 percent of the same period last year,” Hwang added.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2380286,Hwang Jung-min and Lee Jung-jae’s deadly reunion in ‘Deliver Us From Evil’,2020-07-29,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2020/07/29/20200729000561_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Park Jung-min’s character in action-thriller still unveiled Veteran actors Hwang Jung-min and Lee Jung-jae, who called each other “brother” in the crime-noir “New World” (2013), are reunited in the action-packed thriller “Deliver Us From Evil,” this time as bitter enemies. The film revolves around hit man In-nam, played by Hwang, who finishes what he promised would be his last job before fleeing Japan, but unexpectedly gets mixed up in a case in Thailand. In Bangkok, a barbaric killer named Ray, played by Lee -- also known as “the butcher” -- chases In-nam down to avenge the death of his brother. According to the film’s director-writer, Hong Won-chan, the film takes action scenes to the next level -- with everything from gangster fights to shootings, stabbings and bombings in three countries. Hong has written the scripts for several hit action thrillers, including “The Chaser” (2007), “The Scam” (2009) and “The Yellow Sea” (2010). “I decided the climax of the action and the characters’ emotions had to come together, and that the veteran actors would control their emotions along such flow, even without my direction. I relied on the actors a lot this time,” Hong said at a press premiere in Seoul on Tuesday. Hwang had more action scenes in this film than in any of his previous works. “In ‘New World,’ I would say there were many action scenes. We have hard-boiled chase-action scenes in ‘Deliver Us From Evil,’ and I can assure you, they are real. The amount of action scenes was incomparable to any other films, even compared to ‘Veteran’ (2015),” Hwang said in an email interview. A chameleon of an actor, Lee has shown different facets of himself in his previous action movies, including “The Thieves,” “Assassination” and “New World.” Yet another undiscovered side emerges in the new movie. “The script didn’t give much description about Ray, and as an actor, this meant that I could build the character as I chose. We narrowed down on different styles (for the characters’ costumes and appearance), and it was really fun. I think it was one of my most difficult yet fun characters,” Lee said at Tuesday’s press event. Park Jung-min, who stayed away from the public for his transformation in the film, takes up the role of Yu-i, who assists In-nam in Bangkok. “Yu-i has his own past faults and feels indebted to his family. I tried to understand the character focusing on this aspect,” said Park, attending his first press event for the film. “With that in mind, I concentrated on making my acting not too excessive or strange.” Park had previously starred in Hong’s debut flick, “Office” (2015), a suspense thriller that was invited to the Berlinale that year. “I didn’t give (Park) much description about the character because I felt it would limit his thoughts. I also knew that Park puts a lot of effort into understanding his characters and I was curious how he would interpret Yu-i. Park went way beyond my expectations. I’m very grateful.” The director added that the film has its roots in the noir genre, a genre that he loves very much. “The big plot of the story comes from the idea of a sinner saving another sinner, thereby redeeming himself. The title, coming from a Christian prayer, simply paraphrases this plot.” The film opens Aug. 5.

Tentatively titled “Hunt,” the film is expected to kick off production next year, according to the film’s distributor Megabox Joongang Plus M last week. Lee will also play the lead role in the movie. Taking place in 1980s Korea, the film will revolve around national security agents Park Pyong-ho and Kim Jung-do, who are chasing after the chief of North Korea’s espionage operation in the South. Lee will play Park, a member of the agency’s overseas division. Lee joined the production of the spy movie in early 2017. He selected the film -- which was then titled “Namsan” -- as his first production piece and stated he would also take part in writing the film’s screenplay. A few months later, media reported that filmmaker Jung Ji-woo of “Eungyo” (2012) and veteran actor Choi Min-sik would be joining the project as director and lead actor, respectively. However, Jung and Choi ultimately declined to take the part, and star director Han Jae-rim, of “The Face Reader” (2013) and “The King” (2017), was then expected to helm the movie. However, Han also turned down the offer in March 2018. After almost four years of working on the script, Lee finally confirmed he will himself be taking up the role of producer, director and lead actor. Meanwhile, the distributor on Monday told The Korea Herald that another headlining actor, Jung Woo-sung -- well known as a longtime close friend of Lee -- is considering starring in the movie. If Jung confirms the casting, the two actors will partner for the first time in 21 years, since action-drama film “City of the Rising Sun” in 1999. Lee, 47, debuted as a TV actor in 1993 and, in the following year, shot to fame with his first film “The Young Man.” Since then, Lee has had key roles in several hit films, including “The Thieves” (2012), “The New World” (2013) and “Assassination” (2015), which all exceeded the blockbuster milestone of 10 million tickets sold.　 By Choi Ji-won ()",leejungjae,5.0,"The article is entirely focused on Lee Jung-jae, specifically discussing his directorial debut with the film ""Hunt.""

The online film market will try to mirror the offline experience by hosting online concerts, keynote talks and over 150 events, with more than 1,200 online screenings and rights to over 2,300 films on the market, according to Cannes. Among the Korean films at this year’s Cannes Film Market is “Peninsula” by South Korean director Yeon Sang-ho, one of the two Korean films that made Cannes’ 2020 Official Selection. “Peninsula,” the sequel to zombie-thriller “Train to Busan” (2016), features actors Gang Dong-won and Lee Jung-hyun, and is set four years after the zombie apocalypse took place on the Korean Peninsula. “Heaven: To the Land of Happiness” by Korean director Im Sang-soo is the other Korean film that made the 2020 Official selection. Lead actors Choi Min-sik and Park Hae-il play the role of two men who go on a journey to find happiness in their lives. Movies featuring big name actors will be joining the two movies in the film market. “Deliver Us from Evil” by director Hong Won-chan features Korean actors Hwang Jung-min, who plays the role of hitman In-nam, and Lee Jung-jae, playing the role of Ray who chases In-nam, thinking In-nam killed his brother. The movie is set for release in August in Korea. Hwang also appears in director Pil Gam-sung’s “Hostage” which will also be featured at the film market. In “Hostage,” Hwang plays the role of a kidnapped star actor struggling to break free from his captives. “Emergency Declaration” by director Han Jae-rim features “Parasite” lead actor Song Kang-ho along with several veteran actors, including Lee Byung-hun, Kim Nam-gil and Jeon Do-yeon. The movie revolves around a plane that has to make an emergency landing, causing an unprecedented crisis. “Seobok” (working title) by Lee Yong-ju features popular actor, Gong Yoo, who plays former agent Gi-hun, and Park Bo-gum, who appears as the first ever human clone Seobok. Gi-hun and Seobok face many perils as organizations chase Seobok, who holds the key immortality. “Josee” is a Korean remake of Japanese film “Josee, The Tiger and The Fish” (2003), and is a love story starring Han Ji-min and Nam Joo-hyuk. “Hero” by director Yoon Je-kyoon, is a movie that captures the final year of Korean-independence activist, Ahn Jung-geun, based on Korean musical by the same title. Jung Sung-hwa, who played Ahn in the musical, was cast for the movie as well. “Voice of Silence” by director Hong Eui-jeong featuring Yoo Ah-in, “Yaksha: Ruthless Operation” by director Na Hyun featuring Sol Kyung-gu and “Beyond the Mountain” by Choi Jung-tae starring Ahn Nae-sang are also participating in this week’s film market.

Film distributor Merry Christmas announced last week that it has postponed the release of sci-fi flick “Space Sweepers” from summer to later this year, since the danger of COVID-19 infection lingers in the nation. The company stated that it is considering opening the film around the Chuseok holidays in September. The space blockbuster, featuring big names such as Song Joong-ki and Kim Tae-ri, follows the journey of the crew on a debris-collecting space shuttle called the Victory in search of valuable garbage, and its dangerous deal with a humanoid weapon of mass destruction. Another star-studded film, “Deliver Us From Evil” starring Hwang Jung-min and Lee Jung-jae, had its release date pushed back from July to August. The film’s distributor, CJ Entertainment, announced the postponement last week, predicting that early August will be the peak season for the film industry considering the holiday schedule and current market situation. CJ Entertainment is also shifting the release date of the musical film “Hero,” which was expected to hit local cinemas in the summer season. Depicting the final year in the life of of Korean independence fighter Ahn Jung-geun, the film is one of the distributor’s most anticipated tentpole productions of the year. Although the film’s new release date is undecided, the company aims for a release this year to mark the 110th anniversary of Ahn’s death. Action-crime film “Mogadishu” from star director Ryoo Seung-wan, featuring stars Kim Yoon-seok and Jo In-sung, has also been delayed to later this year. Two star directors set for summer comebacks with sequels to previous hits, director Yeon Sang-ho with “Peninsula,” the follow-up to “Train to Busan,” and director Yang Woo-seok with “Steel Rain 2: Summit,” are likely to continue with their original release plans, meaning their films should be out in July or August. The trend accompanies a recent rebound in the number of virus infections and the extension of toughened social distancing measures, announced by the government Friday. While local cinemas have seen the number of moviegoers inch up in June -- thanks to government-provided discount coupons and the introduction of new films -- companies are still hesitant to launch new titles with the ongoing fear of COVID-19 among the general public.

Their synergy in “Deliver Us From Evil” is unlike anything viewers have seen before, they say. The two actors and the director, Hong Won-chan, held a promotional press conference Friday ahead of the film’s release in July. While the 2013 film was notable for the bromance between the two actors, this time around the pair takes on an action-packed killer vs. killer chase. Hit man In-nam, played by Hwang, completes what he believes to be his last mission only to find himself being chased by “butcher” Ray, played by Lee. Upon learning of a kidnapping case in Thailand, In-nam heads to Bangkok. Ray, who believes In-nam is behind his brother’s death, follows. “The story is about a character who has sinned being redeemed by another character,” director Hong said. “While a lot of people are excited to see the two actors team up again, it was in some ways a burden for me as a producer. I felt the pressure to portray the two actors differently. “The two characters are very different from each other and also from the actors’ previous roles.” Hwang said, “It was fun. Just like the audience, I also felt great excitement when I faced Lee as Ray in the film. We talked a lot before the action scenes.” The film was shot in three locations -- South Korea, Bangkok and Tokyo -- with around 80 percent of the filming taking place in Bangkok. “The characters aren’t ordinary, so the locations also had to be far from mundane. Bangkok is a very special city. While it’s metropolitan for the most part, there are some chaotic and sacred aspects to the city as well, and we tried to express those qualities … in the film,” Hong said. Hong Kyung-pyo, in charge of cinematography, has worked with several acclaimed directors before. They include Bong Joon-ho on “Snowpiercer” (2015) and “Parasite” (2019), Na Hong-jin on “Wailing” (2016) and Lee Chang-dong on “Burning” (2018). While actor Park Jung-min plays one of the main roles, Park does not appear in any promotional images. Explaining Park’s absence, Lee said the rising star was a “surprise gift” for the audience, hinting at the actor’s transformation in the film. Park, 33, made his name in 2011 with the award-winning film “Bleak Night” and rose to stardom with the 2016 film “Dongju: The Portrait of a Poet,” for which he won several awards for best new actor. “Our film is not based on any true story or historical incident and we focused wholly on expanding the cinematic elements of the action genre,” director Hong said. “We hope the audience can come to the cinema and indulge in it on a large screen,” the director said.

Film distributor Next Entertainment World on Monday confirmed that highly-anticipated zombie flick “Peninsula” would hit local theaters in July, featuring veteran actors Gang Dong-won and Lee Jung-hyun. A sequel to the 2016 smash-hit thriller “Train to Busan” by director Yeon Sang-ho, the film takes place on the Korean Peninsula, which has been left in ruins following the outbreak of a zombie apocalypse four years back. In the film, Gang takes up the role of Jung-seok, a survivor who escapes the worst but is sent back to the peninsula on a mission to bring out an unidentified truck. Jung-seok and his team are faced by not only zombies, but the survivors in the Army Unit 631 who have dehumanized amid the madness and confusion. Actress Lee stars as another survivor, Min-jung, who saves the lives of Jung-suk and his team from a deadly attack by zombies.

For instance, Korea had been mostly impregnable for local zombie stories, although foreign zombie productions, including the famed “Walking Dead” series, were popular here. But after the success of hit film “Train to Busan” in 2016, a zombie action thriller which sold more than 11 million tickets to become the 16th biggest hit here, home-grown zombie contents are becoming a profitable commodity. In January, Netflix released a new original series “Kingdom,” a Korean zombie period drama. The streaming giant gave the green light for a second season, even before the first season aired.  But not all Korea-made zombie productions have enjoyed unprecedented success. In October, film “Rampant,” another zombie period story, failed, selling only 1.5 million tickets. Other local films with the supernatural themes have also been making strides. Film director Jang Jae-hyun set spark to the occult thriller film genre with “The Priests” in 2015. It portrayed the fight of two priests against a demon, and opened a new era for the genre, selling 5 million tickets. This year, the director returned with the theme, with “Savaha: The Sixth Finger” in February. The film centers on the character of a Christian pastor, played by actor Lee Jung-jae, probing a mysterious religious group. The small screen is not an exception to the occult theme, as shown by cable channel OCN, a major player in the occult thriller scene here. The channel, under entertainment giant CJ ENM, has launched a string of original drama series since 2010. Since then, it has been creating action-packed series with dark humor -- a quality unseen in the local drama scene.   The channel tasted success in 2017 with drama “Save Me” that deals with the crimes of a religious cult. The series’ lead actress Seo Ye-ji rose to stardom through the show. The 16-episode drama gained the highest viewership rating of 4.8 percent and is set to air its second season in May. OCN’s “Children of Lesser God,” earlier last year, featured actress Kim Ok-bin as an investigator who is able to sense ghosts. Able to see death, Kim’s character played a central role in solving crimes by a corrupt religious cult. Fueled with success, last fall, the channel aired another occult thriller series “The Guest,” which presented a mix of exorcism and shamanism. The series featuring a psychic, a priest and a detective, marked the highest viewership rating of 4.1 percent. It will be adapted into a film. Its successor “Priest” was a medical-exorcism drama, a collaboration of a doctor and an exorcist fighting supernatural crimes. But it received a lukewarm response from viewers, with its ratings peaking at just 2.5 percent, possibly due to the repetitiveness of the genre. In March, OCN once again released a spooky supernatural thriller series “Possessed.” The Wednesday-Thursday series, however, takes a slight turn from the previous productions, adding the elements of a sweet romantic comedy. The series, featuring actress Go Joon-hee as a psychic, has already aired two episodes.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1918742,"[Herald Review] ‘Savaha’ has clever buildup, relevant message, insufficient payoff",2019-02-14,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2019/02/14/20190214000817_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"In only his second feature-length film, director Jang Jae-hyun cleverly builds up suspense while mixing it up with mystery and a message about religion in “Savaha: The Sixth Finger.” But it takes a U-turn toward the end, which I thought was a strange move. While it is not a bad film, I did not think the payoff was satisfying at the end of such a heart-pumping journey. The film starts with the backstory of Geum-hwa (Lee Jae-in) who was born with a twin sister she, and every member of the family, thought was a fiendish being of some sort. For 15 years, the other twin is kept locked up in a barn, locked away from the rest of the world.  Christian pastor Park (Lee Jung-jae), who makes a living investigating and disclosing shady pseudo-religious groups, comes across a group that is revealed to have a suspect of a child murder in their midst. While probing the case, Park runs into mysterious fanatic Na-han (Park Jung-min) and a much darker secret held by the cult and a figure shrouded in mystery who has him questioning everything he knows about the world and his religion. Those familiar with Jang’s first film “The Priests” and have seen previews for his latest may expect an occult film, and it definitely seems that way from the beginning. But audiences soon learn that the film plays out more like a thriller that asks fundamental questions about religion. In many ways, fear and faith in an all-powerful being goes hand in hand. In the form of horror, the film challenges the audience to question what it believes to be the absolute truth. Embodying the idea is the pastor, with Lee Jung-jae delivering a solid performance. Despite his profession, he is not really a man of faith, but a man who doubts everything to find answers. I had some problems with how Park’s character was written, but he has the natural looks of a complex human being and acting skills to summon the emotions that depict his inner struggles. The rest of the cast, however, did not leave a huge impression. Lee Jae-in’s acting was good, even without consideration of the 15-year-old actress’s age, but her character was not written with much depth. Sometimes there are characters written solely to serve a purpose, which I thought was the case here. Jung Jin-young’s detective character was an enormous disappointment. Not that the veteran actor performed poorly, but his character essentially served no role in terms of the story. If you were going to have the rubber-stamp police character, why have your best actor play it? I can see what Yoo Ji-tae was going for with his calm and mysterious demeanor, but the mystery does not work that well when it is this obvious, and his performance feels far too familiar. The bits and pieces of truth come together toward the third act, and the buildup was pretty solid. But I thought the film was inconsistent in its tone. I was confused as to whether it wanted to be a mystery thriller or a film about the supernatural, which was why I thought the ending was a bit lazy. Overall, I think it is a decently acted, decently directed film, but one not written very well. However, it does have some solid moments and asks intriguing questions, so I won’t say it would be a waste of time to at least check it out. “Savaha: The Sixth Finger” opens in local theaters Wednesday.

From the Cannes-screened “The Merciless,” starring Sol Kyung-gu and Im Si-wan as gangsters, to “Bluebeard,” in which Cho Jin-woong plays a doctor driven to psychological and financial edge, films this year presented struggling male characters as leads. “Memoir of a Murderer” saw Sol Kyung-gu as a serial killer with Alzheimer’s disease. The recently opened “The Swindlers” features Yoo Ji-tae as a power-hungry prosecutor and Hyun Bin as a cunning scam artist. Films such as “A Taxi Driver” and “Battleship Island” tackled momentous historical incidents such as the Gwangju Democratic Uprising of 1980 and Japanese soldiers’ brutal treatment of Koreans on Hashima Island, respectively. It seems Korean cinema will continue in its streak of male-dominated thrillers, period pieces and crime flicks in 2018, according to next year’s lineup revealed by Korea’s four largest film distributors CJ E&M, Showbox, Next Entertainment World and Lotte Entertainment. Big-budget blockbusters, period pieces  Next year, NEW will release comic action flick “Psychokinesis” by director Yeon Sang-ho, whose 2016 zombie flick “Train to Busan” reaped international success. The 10 billion won ($9 million) film will feature Ryo Seung-ryong as a father with supernatural powers who seeks to save his daughter, played by Shim Eun-kyung. NEW will also present “Ansisung” by director Kim Gwang-sik, a massive period piece with a 15 billion won budget. The film will star Jo In-sung as Yang Man-chun, the Goguryeo commander from the 640s who defended Korea’s Ansi Fortress against a Chinese invasion.  Lotte Entertainment’s “Along with the Gods,” directed by Kim Yong-hwa, boasts a huge budget of 40 billion won, and has been presold to over 100 countries prior to its December release. The film, based on a webtoon series of the same title, follows a traditional Korean folk story of the afterlife.   Next year, the second installation of the film will be released, starring Ma Dong-seok. Lotte Entertainment will also be releasing Jo Geun-hyun’s “Heungbu,” starring the late actor Kim Joo-hyuk, who died in a car accident in October, next year.  NEW will be releasing Kim Sung-hoon’s “Changweol (Outbreak),” a zombie flick set in the Joseon era. Thrillers, thrillers Thrillers and crime flicks have been all the rage in recent years, sparked by the popularity of 2015’s films such as “Inside Men” and “Veteran,” which dealt with the dark underworld of Korea’s politicians and the wealthy. Next year, CJ E&M will be releasing thrillers such as No Dong-seok’s “Golden Slumber,” featuring Gang Dong-won; director Lee Jong-seok’s “Negotiation” featuring Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin in a kidnap thriller; Choo Chang-min’s “A Night of Seven Years,” featuring Jang Dong-gun and based on Korean writer Jeong Yoo-jeong’s novel of the same title; and Jang Jae-hyun’s “Sabaha,” starring Lee Jung-jae as a pastor who becomes embroiled in the supernatural goings on at a cult. 　 Showbox is also set to showcase crime thrillers such as Woo Min-ho’s “Drug King,” starring Song Kang-ho and Bae Doo-na, based on a true story of a drug case that shook Korea in the 1970s. 　 A handful of films will be centering on inter-Korean tensions, another staple theme in Korean cinema of late. Last year saw Kim Sung-hoon’s “Confidential Assignment,” about a collaborative project between a South Korean detective and North Korean secret agent, while this year’s “V.I.P.” featured Lee Jong-seok as a cold-blooded serial killer from North Korea’s upper echelons. 　 Yang Woo-seok’s “Steel Rain,” set to open on Dec. 20, will see Jung Woo-sung as a top North Korean agent who sneaks into South Korea at a precipice of an a regime change in the North. 　 Next year, CJ E&M will release Yoon Jong-bin’s “Gongjak,” featuring a South Korean secret agent who makes a clandestine deal with the North prior to the 1997 presidential elections. Kim Byung-woo’s “PMC” will feature Ha Jung-woo and Lee Sun-kyun in a secret mission in an underground bunker. Kang Byung-cheol’s “Swing Kids” will be set in a prison camp during the Korean War, where South and North Korean soldiers overcome ideological differences in a comedy drama. On the prevalence of similar genres, experts say that the film industry is inevitably responding to profits. The 10 most-viewed films in 2017 are all movies that center on male characters, with the exception of “I Can Speak,” a comedy-drama starring Lee Je-hoon and Na Moon-hee.　 “A Taxi Driver,” “Confidential Assignment” and crime action flick “The Outlaws” occupied the top three slots as of November. Next on the list were “Battleship Island,” “Midnight Runners,” a buddy movie featuring two male students at a police academy, and “The King,” about the ruthless world of Korean politics. 　 “Investors continue to invest in crime action flicks because they’re popular,” said film critic Kang Yoo-jung, who added, “Mid-size films of various genres, including romance, melodrama and horror are necessary for the film market to maintain its diversity.” Female-centric films peek through   At the same time, 2017 saw a handful of films centering on female characters, though few achieved commercial success. In the mystery-thriller “House of the Disappeared,” Kim Yun-jin played a mother of two boys navigating time and death in a haunted home. Bong Joon-ho’s “Okja” saw the 13-year-old Ahn Seo-hyun as its young heroine, while singer-turned-actress Ahn So-hee played a central part in drama “A Single Rider.” 　 Kim Jong-kwan’s “The Table,” distributed by At Nine Film, saw four actresses -- Jung Yu-mi, Han Ye-ri, Jung Eun-chae and Im Soo-jung -- as its main characters.　 Actress Moon So-ri set a new milestone in Korean cinema by directing, scripting and starring in “The Running Actress.” The humorous drama film, which dealt with the behind-the-scenes life of an actress, received critical acclaim. The indie film, however, was distributed by Metaplay only to a select few theaters. 　 Actress Kim Hye-soo starred in “A Special Lady,” a noir thriller about female gang boss Na Hyun-jung which opened in November. Despite its touting of a strong female character, however, many critics commented on the outdated version of womanhood the film offered.  In 2018, Min Kyu-dong’s “Herstory” featuring Kim Hee-ae and Kim Hae-sook will deal with the comfort women issue, tracing the legal battle that took place between 1992 and 1998 at Busan and Shimonoseki courtrooms. The film wrapped up shooting on Nov. 6. 　  A roster of female actresses, including Lee Yu-young, Ye Soo-jung and Moon Sook star in the film. According to film critic Hwang Jin-mee, the tide is slowly turning and viewers are calling for diversity. 　 “The market has started to become aware of what viewers want to see and what viewers are sick of. But what we’re seeing right now are films that have already been made in the past, according to old ideas.” 　 By Rumy Doo ()",leejungjae,4.0,"The article directly mentions Lee Jung-jae in reference to his upcoming role in the thriller ""Sabaha,"" where he plays a pastor investigating supernatural events at a cult.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1025400,[Herald Review] Complexities of war lost in ‘Operation Chromite’,2016-07-21,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2016/07/21/20160721000511_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"What’s left is simple heroism and rote sentimentality The upcoming Korean War film “Operation Chromite” takes on the loaded subject matter with a studded cast of Korean A-listers and Hollywood actor Liam Neeson, best known to Korean audiences for his 2008 thriller “Taken.” It clearly aims to be a commercial blockbuster, armed with glitzy visuals, loud battle scenes, budding wartime romance and easily imaginable characters. It is, however, all style and very little substance. And like most recent Korean films that draw on conflict with the North -- including last year‘s “Northern Limit Line” -- it is much too focused on simple heroism. The film’s intention, as professed by director Lee Jae-han after a press screening in Seoul on Wednesday, was to celebrate the unsung heroes of the Incheon landing of September 1950, considered one of the most decisive military operations in modern warfare. In Korea, the operation and its commander Gen. Douglas MacArthur of the U.S. Army who led the United Nations allied forces into the port city, are lauded in history books as having contributed largely to the 1953 armistice. The way the “Operation Chromite” plot develops is akin to a textbook account on the event. Most of the risky military strategy -- which involved navigating through the torrential waters near Incheon and a 1 in 5,000 chance of success for the mission -- is explained via dialogue. Suspenseful music persists in the background from beginning to end, exhausting the actual suspense. According to director Lee, the film tries to focus on the psychological tension between the North Korean Commander Lim Gye-jin, played by Lee Beom-soo, and South Korean Navy Lt. Jang Hak-soo, played by Lee Jung-jae, who is dispatched by MacArthur to infiltrate enemy forces. Because the audience knows that the Incheon operation was a success, this dynamic could have offered unexpected suspense before the known ending. But the tension dies out while the two blandly characterized soldiers -- the infinitely villainous North Korean versus the devoted South Korean who joined the military to protect his mother -- are occupied exchanging lengthy glares amid cigarette smoke. All the while, MacArthur, played by the usually formidable Neeson, is isolated from the rest of the cast -- for the sake of filming schedules and financial reasons, one can only assume -- and rendered lifeless. The celebrated Irish actor, despite his much-hyped casting, appears on screen for less than 20 minutes and only interacts with Lee Jung-jae in one brief scene. MacArthur’s mannerisms may have been replicated, but the character is given no emotional depth. Neeson struggles -- through no fault of his own -- to bring some sense of dimension to a character in which there is very little to work with. Faced with an impossible military dilemma, thwarted political ambitions and intense opposition, MacArthur could have been a rich character to explore. But in director Lee’s rendition, the general only growls a few lines of generic and truly awful dialogue, including phrases like “Old age may have wrinkled my skin, but when you lose your ideals, it wrinkles your soul.” Amid the film’s polished visuals, fancy camerawork and obvious computer graphics, the complexities of war and human nature are stripped down to rote sentimentality and a glamorous cast -- which includes Jung Joon-ho and Kim Sun-ah. At the end, the audience is left wondering what exactly “Operation Chromite” was about. The film will open in local theaters on July 27.

But Liam Neeson, who portrays the legendary Gen. Douglas MacArthur of the U.S. Army in the upcoming war drama flick “Operation Chromite,” says he was made an offer he “couldn’t refuse.” The film’s director Lee Jae-han and producer Jung Tae-won, who helms the production company Taewon Entertainment, were “very, very persuasive, let’s just put it that way,” said the renowned Irish actor at a press conference in Seoul on Wednesday. “But I was very aware that very few western actors had come over here ... so I felt very honored, actually. And very privileged,” Neeson said, adding he has always been interested in the Korean War. 　 The 64-year-old actor, who has appeared in more than 70 films since he rose to prominence in the 1993 Oscar winner “Schindler’s List,” said he was drawn to the simplicity of the script of “Operation Chromite” 　 “I thought it told a very complex story in a very palatable and easy way to follow for audiences. And it’s very emotional,” he said. There were times, however, when Neeson felt intimidated by the role of the charismatic general who has long been heralded as a national hero here. The film traces the general’s much-contested, high-risk operation to land the United Nations allied forces in Korea’s western port city of Incheon in September 1950 -- an operation that eventually led the Korean army to a decisive victory in battle against the invading North Korean troops. Neeson said he read numerous biographies and visited Incheon’s Jayu (Freedom) Park, which is dedicated to the general, in order to prepare for his role. “I remember this was just before I started shooting and I suddenly got very nervous, thinking, can I do this? Am I up for this? (MacArthur) is revered. He’s almost got saint-like status in the country.” The actor overcame his concerns in part by meticulously researching the general’s mannerisms. “There were certain characteristics that MacArthur had ... for example ... he always wore his hat at (an) ... angle, which pissed off other commanders. He would smoke his corn cob pipe everywhere because he felt it gave him a certain authority” he said. 　 Neeson also added that his first-time experience on set with an all-Korean film crew was “mind-blowing,” “I’ve never worked with a crew that was so (perfectionist), so fast. ... Their dedication and commitment to all their individual jobs was quite awe-inspiring to me.”　 The actor also heaped praise on his co-star Lee Jung-jae, who plays Korean intelligence captain Jang Hak-soo who infiltrates the North Korean army in an undercover mission. “When I’m in the presence of a real actor, I can tell,” he said. “I felt Jung-jae was a very, very pure cinema actor. He has this beautiful quality of stillness, deceptive simplicity. ... As a performer it made me feel ... at ease, because I was working with a wonderful professional.” Lee, also present at the press conference alongside the film’s director and producer, said he interviewed surviving members of the Incheon operation to prepare for his role. 　 “Operation Chromite” will open in local theaters on July 27.

On Sept. 15, 1950, the U.N. and South Korean forces penetrated Incheon, then captured by the North, through an amphibious invasion. That invasion, known as the Battle of Incheon, saved South Korea from the brink of Korean War defeat and played a decisive role in its victory against the North, according to historians. ""Operation Chromite,"" directed by John H. Lee, will center on a secret intelligence unit that spied on North Korea to prepare for that historic battle. ""At first, I thought it would be another war movie, but upon reading the scenario, I realized it's more of a suspense thriller,"" South Korean actor Lee Jung-jae told reporters at a press conference in Seoul.

With an airtight plot about a group of grifters and hustlers who steal from the Bank of Korea with realistic and savvy dialogues, the heist film was not only critically acclaimed but also was a commercial hit, bringing in over 2 million moviegoers according to KOBIS, the Korean Film Council’s box office tracking service.As it turns out, that was just the warm-up. Choi’s sophomore film “Tazza: The High Rollers” in 2006 made him a household name with its colorful and dynamic portrayal of Korea’s card gambling underworld. With nearly 6 million seats filled, it was an unequivocal hit. The movie won him top honors at the prestigious Baeksang Arts Awards that year.The 2010 fantasy action movie “Woochi” took Choi’s filmography to a new direction. Starring the wide-eyed Kang Dong-won as a mythical hero chasing down goblins, the film was lauded as Korea’s answers to superhero blockbusters. “Woochi” brought in over 6 million viewers, marking another milestone for Choi.In 2012 came “Thieves,” the star-studded caper film that left Choi’s mark on the Korean cinema history. With its cast including Jun Ji-hyun, Kim Hye-soo, Kim Yun-seok, Lee Jung-jae and Kim Soo-hyun, Choi spun a tale of the masters of the underworld teaming up to steal a precious diamond in Macau. Choi’s strong characters, crisp dialogues and well-planned action sequences made the film the must-see of the year, eventually attracting nearly 13 million people to theaters.Although many people compare “Assassination” to “The Thieves” because of its strong ensemble (including Jun Ji-hyun and Lee Jung-jae from “The Thieves”) and grand-scheme storyline, Choi told the press ahead of the film’s release that “Assassination” was a new stylistic attempt. “I wanted it to be different from ‘The Thieves,’” he said. “I wanted to take out the cheerful, lively and skill-focused aspects and make it more classic.”Although “Assassination” has strong dialogues, he said the characters were designed to be more reserved. “While the personality of each character was revealed quickly in ‘The Thieves,’ in (“Assassination”) I wanted it to be slower, to make the audience understand the characters bit by bit.” “Assassination” ― about a group of freedom fighters targeting Japanese and pro-Japanese officials in the 1930s during Japan’s imperial rule of the Korean peninsula ― hit the 10 million mark in ticket sales on the 70th anniversary of Liberation Day on Aug. 15.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/537655,‘Assassination’ an ode to Korea’s 1930s independence fighters,2015-06-22,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2015/06/22/20150622001062_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"The year is 1933. A female sniper, a gun expert and a bomb expert are pulled into an unlikely ragtag team by a political mastermind to assassinate two key figures in the Japanese regime governing Korea. Their plan is slipped to a ruthless paid assassin, who begins to hunt them down. The plot of the upcoming film “Assassination” is thrilling enough in and of itself to be a box office success, but according to director Choi Dong-hoon, the aim of the movie is to tell the story of those who fought for justice in Korea’s darkest era. “I read a lot of books while preparing this movie,” Choi said at a press conference at CGV Apgujeong on Monday. “When I was looking through photos of the independence fighters, I came across a lot of people that have gone down in history, but also photos of people whose names we would never know. It gave me a strange feeling. I began to wonder how they lived, where their courage came from. I wanted to make a film remembering those who should never be forgotten.” In order to bring those people to life, Choi, who helmed past hits like “Tazza: The High Rollers” (2006) and “The Thieves” (2012) brought together an all-star cast. Jun Ji-hyun (also known abroad as Gianna Jun) played the female shooter leading the assassination plot, while other key characters were played by A-listers such as Lee Jung-jae in the part of the mysterious mastermind, Ha Jung-woo in the part of the mercenary assassin, as well as Cho Jin-woong, Choi Duk-moon and Oh Dal-soo. The film was long in the making. Choi first had the idea for the scenario while shooting “Tazza,” and scrapped an earlier version of the script in order to create a movie with more depth. “We actually spoke about the movie quite a bit when we were promoting ‘The Thieves,’” said Jun. “When he told me about the film, I knew that it would be a truly unique story. I suggested a lot of different ideas to him, but when the final script came out I was so surprised. The characters were so diverse, and the plot was riveting. I was amazed that the story we had talked about could end up like this.” “Assassination” was filmed over five months in Shanghai and Seoul, with elaborate action scenes taking place on sprawling, lavish sets recreating the ambience of 1930s Gyeongseong (Seoul‘s name at the time) and the Provisional Government of Korea in Shanghai. “I felt that the best environment for the actors to bring out their characters required accurate recreations of the clothing and spaces of the 1930s,” Choi said. All together, the film cost an impressive 18 billion won ($16 million) to make, bringing together Korea’s top names in costuming, set design, lighting and production. “The Korean independence movement was a long fight, with heroes that are unimaginable for ordinary people like me,” Choi said. “I wanted to make this an entertaining film and a meaningful film.

The periodic action flick “Roaring Currents” drew 17.6 million viewers becoming the most-watched film of all time, while three other films joined the coveted 10 million viewer’s club, including “The Attorney,” “Frozen,” and “Interstellar.” This year is also marked with a stellar lineup of new films from local heavyweight directors to Hollywood blockbusters ― some starring Korean actors. Here’s what we have to look forward to in 2015. Return of star directors “Gangnam 1970” is the final installment of director Yoo Ha’s trilogy of “street series,” dubbed after his first two films that depicted street gangsters ― “Once Upon a Time in High School” (2004) and “A Dirty Carnival” (2006).   The noir action film is set against the backdrop of an exploding real estate market in Seoul’s Gangnam district in the 1970s, a turbulent era under the dictatorship of military strongman Park Chung-hee. Two childhood friends find themselves forced to become enemies, mired with misunderstanding, revenge and conspiracy. The film marks heartthrob Lee Min-ho's first leading role in a film as he joins actor Kim Rae-won. The film opens in theaters on Jan. 21. Following 2012’s box-office hit “The Thieves”― which garnered 12.98 million viewers ― director Choi Dong-hoon is back with another star-studded flick “The Assassination.” Actress Jun Ji-hyun and actor Lee Jung-jae from “The Thieves” star with actors Ha Jung-woo and Cho Jin-woong. The film tells the story of assassins taking out a pro-Japanese group set in Shanghai and Seoul in 1930s. The film is slated for release in July. Renowned director Im Kwon-taek’s 102nd film “Revivre” will be released here in March, following the critically acclaimed premiere at last year’s Venice Film Festival. Based on Korean author Kim Hoon’s award-winning novel “Hwajang” (Korean word with two meanings: makeup and cremation), the film centers on a top marketing executive at a major cosmetic company (played by veteran actor Ahn Sung-ki) who falls in love with a young woman when his wife is dying of a brain tumor. It is Ahn’s seventh film with the director. More Hollywood glory days? Riding on the success of last year’s Hollywood flicks, including “Frozen” and “Interstellar,” this year also brings a lineup of imported blockbusters, peppered with Korean actors, vying to win over the hearts of cinemagoers here. “The Avengers: Age of Ultron,” a highly anticipated superhero sequel to the 2012 box office hit, will arrive in the theaters in April. The viewers will finally be able to see the superheroes fighting their battles in different venues in Seoul, including Mapo Bridge, Saebit Dungdungseom and Gangnam district, as the flick was filmed here last March. Marvel Comics’ favorite heroes, including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), assemble again to battle their new nemesis Ultron (James Spader). Newcomers for this edition feature Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Dr. Cho, a friend of Iron Man played by Korean actress Kim Soo-hyun. The Wachowski brothers, credited with the hit movies “The Matrix” and “Cloud Atlas,” are delivering another mind-boggling sci-fi thriller “Jupiter Ascending” in February. Korean actress Bae Doo-na will appear in her second Wachowski film ― after “Cloud Atlas” in 2012 ― alongside Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum and Eddie Redmayne. Actor Lee Byung-hun stars in “Terminator Genisys,” the fifth installment in the “Terminator” series which is said to serve as a sequel, prequel and reboot to the series. Former California Gov.

The award-winning actor said in a press release Thursday that Lim never introduced him to a Tong Yang Group vice chairman and that his partnership with Tong Yang Corp., the group’s property development company, ended long before a financial crisis began at the conglomerate. Rumor had it that Lee, using Lim’s personal links to Tong Yang Group’s founding family, took out a bank loan of 30 billion won ($27 million) in 2009 on collateral provided by the group, for the construction of a luxury residential building in Gangnam. As the project hit a snag, he pulled out of the project, which resulted in damage to the group. Tong Yang collapsed under mounting debts in 2013 and in the process it inflicted losses on nearly 40,000 individual investors through its securities brokerage unit. “To the contrary, Lee didn’t get his investment totaling 900 million won back from Tong Yang,” Lee’s agency, CJeS Entertainment, said through a press release. Rumors about the business deal as well as the actor’s relationship with Lim have been circulating since an online media outlet reported in detail about their relationship. “The two have been friends for a long time,” the agency said, adding that the friendship had only recently developed into something beyond friendship.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3637512,Jupiter prepares legal battle against KBS for alleged plagiarism of ‘The Face Reader’,2014-08-25,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2014/08/25/20140825001212_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Jupiter Films, the producer of the epic film “The Face Reader” (2013), filed a provisional injunction action against state-run broadcaster KBS 2TV over a violation of intellectual property rights. Kangho, the legal representative of Jupiter Films, issued a press release on Monday, alleging that KBS’ upcoming epic television series “The King’s Face” breaches intellectual property rights. The provisional injunction request was submitted to the Seoul Central District Court. The law firm claimed that the aim of the provisional injunction request was to protect Jupiter’s intellectual property rights and fair trade against the defendants, broadcaster KBS Media and drama producer KBS Media. The controversial 24-episode drama “The King’s Face” is scheduled to air from November. KBS has not yet issued an official statement about the legal dispute. “We have not yet been given the official statement to issue,” a KBS spokesperson said, suggesting that the managers remain undecided over the issue. A legal battle seems inevitable if Jupiter and KBS fail to reach an agreement on the upcoming drama.  The bones of contention are whether KBS referred to the script of the film “The Face Reader” when creating the screenplay of “The King’s Face,” and whether the two works have verifiable common features that make it possible to prove that the film is the original source of the upcoming television drama. In the press release, Kangho alleged that in December 2010, Jupiter adopted the “one-source-multi-use strategy,” creating a script that could be adapted into three different forms -- a novel, a movie and an epic television series -- as the property rights owner of the original work. The novel “The Face Reader,” consisting of two volumes, was published in fall of 2013 on the sidelines of the movie’s launch. Kangho insisted that Jupiter and KBS had meetings to discuss the television series of the work, but the deal fell through as the two failed to reach an agreement. In the process, Jupiter gave the script and the printed proposal on the drama version of “The Face Reader” to KBS to review. In addition, Kangho claimed that KBS’ drama has many of the same plot features and characteristics that cannot be interpreted as merely incidental. The drama’s production staff, too, turned out to be the same crew that Jupiter initially offered the job to at the time it discussed producing the drama with KBS, Kangho added. “The Face Reader,” starring Song Gang-ho, Lee Jung-jae, Baek Yoon-sik, Kim Hye-soo and Lee Jong-suk, launched in cinemas in September 2013. The film attracted some 9.1 million viewers, raking in 66 billion won ($65 million) in box office sales and securing a spot among the top 10 most-viewed Korean films.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3638262,Home of ‘The Hourglass’ looks to expand tourism reach,2014-07-04,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2014/07/04/20140704001112_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"For years, the East Coast beachside area of Jeongdongjin in Gangneung City, Gangwon Province has been riding the coattails of one of the nation’s most popular 90s TV dramas, “The Hourglass,” featuring Choi Min-Soo, Lee Jung-Jae and Park Sang-won. The SBS political crime series first aired in 1995 and is still considered one of the most significant and highest-rated TV productions in Korean drama history and had drama fans flocking to the coast to see first-hand some of the show’s iconic filming locations. Among some of Gangneung’s most popular tourist attractions is the picturesque beach-front Jeongdongjin train station ― the on-site location of a popular scene from “The Hourglass” where Park, with the wind breezing through her hair, waited at the platform for her train with the thrashing ocean waves behind her, before being taken into custody by the police right as her train arrived. Since the airing of the show, the famous train station has managed to attract more sight-seers wanting solely to visit the station than passengers who were there to board a train. Last year alone, more than 174,000 visitors paid the modest 500 won entrance fee just to walk along the tracks and take photos, compared to the some 116,000 train ticket holders. The Hourglass Park located at Jeongdongjin Beach is also a big tourist hot spot in the region, highlighted by the world’s largest hourglass sculpture as its centerpiece. The larger than life hourglass is filled with approximately 8 tons of sand and weighs some 40 tons. In keeping with the park’s theme of time, visitors can also stop by the Jeongdongjin Time Story museum and take a step back in “time.” The Time Story museum is located inside a seven-freight show train right next to the hourglass sculpture and showcases antique clocks and timepieces from all over the world in three separately themed exhibitions: Time and Science; Time and Art; and Time and Passion. The museum showcases a wide variety of rare timepieces including the world’s only “Titanic pocket watch,” indicating the exact time when the Titanic sank. For those taking a relaxing stroll by down the beach, the museum can be a nice educational aside to one’s trip. Travelers can stop by the museum’s quaint caf in the first freight car and enjoy a variety of espresso and non-coffee drinks before learning everything there is to know about time. However, despite the number of attractions Jeongdongjin Beach has to offer, it’s almost needless to say that the one feature that first catches most visitors’ attention, aside from beaches’ pale blue water, is not the park’s giant Hourglass or the Time Story museum; surprisingly enough, the most eye-catching structure in the area is a well-known cliff-side hotel, located right at the edge of a coastal cliff. While it may not carry the name of the Ritz Carlton or the Hilton, it has still managed to attract flocks of on-lookers and guests for the simple fact that the hotel is shaped like a giant yacht. Sun Cruise Resort & Yacht is the world’s first on-land cruise-themed resort and is said to have some of the best views of the sunrise in all of Korea, giving travelers yet another reason to visit the coast. Building onto the Jeongdongjin’s Oceanside theme, Korail has recently established a new rail biking path right alongside the beach. Expected to be opened sometime next month, the 5-km-stretch of rail circles around the whole of the Hourglass Park, giving visitors a more active option to sightseeing. While it’s certainly not the most thrifty option to seeing the area ― with prices listed at 20,000 won for a two-seater and 30,000 for a four-seater ― it can be a fun alternative, although the views are far from being spectacular. The Korail Sea Train, which first launched in 2007, is also a popular activity on many tourists’ to-do list in Gangneung City. The quick-trip sightseeing locomotive has large windows and seats strategically adjusted to face them for the purpose of providing riders with the best views of the coast. The train follows along the East Coast traveling from Gangneung to Samcheok Station. Similar to the soon-to-be-open Jeongdongjin Rail Bike, while the Sea Train does indeed offer travelers an alternative way to see the coast, the overall scenery is not exactly breath-taking enough to the point where it is recommended that travelers should make a special trip to Gangwon Province solely to take this train. A one-way trip from Gangneung to Samcheok Station takes approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes, for only half of which one can actually see views of the ocean in between the intervals of tunnels and other local train station pit stops. Ticket prices range from 10,800 won to 15,000 won. For more information on the Sea Train or the Jeongdongjin Rail Bike, visit www.seatrain.co.kr or www.sunbike.kr, respectively.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3724248,2 Korean movies among top 12 female vengeance movies: Time,2014-04-30,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2014/04/30/20140430000846_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Two Korean movies, “Lady Vengeance (2005)” and “The Housemaid (2010),” are among the top 12 female vengeance films selected by the online edition of Time. “We present a dozen movies, from Hollywood, France and South Korea, that treat the vengeful-woman theme with fondness or dread, as comedy, melodrama or stark tragedy,” the U.S. weekly magazine wrote on Tuesday. In contrast to the magazine’s criticisms on Korean melodramas -– “classic Hollywood fare gone totally nuts” -– it gave Korean crime movies more credit for being “vividly displayed, (its) retribution way more lurid.” “Lady Vengeance” was directed and cowritten by Park Chan-wook, who previously directed two other bloody vengeance films, “Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002)” and “Oldboy (2003).” The success of film Oldboy added Park’s presence in the international film industry, as a representative figure of Korean vengeance movie. Lee Geum-ja, played by actress Lee Young-ae, is the tragic heroine of Lady Vengeance. Her life begins to falter as she is convicted of murdering a schoolboy on behalf of a child serial killer, Baek (played by “Oldboy” star Choi Min-sik). Behind bars, she witnesses dehumanizing abuse between female prisoners. Released early as a model prisoner, she begins her new life as “lady vengeance” and sets off to get even with Baek who ruined the lives of many parents and hers. The other Korean film, “The Housemaid,” was directed and written by Im Sang-woo. The movie is a remake of the eponymous 1960 flick by Kim Ki-young. The movie starts off with Eun-yi (Jeon Do-yeon), a naive, working-class girl, being hired by a wealthy family. She gets pregnant by the attractive, control-obsessed patriarch, Hoon (played by Lee Jung-jae), but is forcibly taken to the hospital for an abortion by the dragon ladies of the aristocratic family. Realizing that rich people only see the poor as their pawns, the frustrated heroine takes up one last act of vengeance. Time’s 10 other top female vengeance films include: “The Women (1939),” “The Bride Wore Black (1968),” “Carrie (1976),” “9 to 5 (1980),” “Thelma & Louise (1991),” “The First Wives Club (1996),” “Kill Bill (2003-4),” “The Help (2011)” and “Frozen (2013).” By Chung Joo-won ()",leejungjae,3.0,"The article mentions Lee Jung-jae in a supporting context as he played the character Hoon in ""The Housemaid"" (2010), one of the featured Korean vengeance films. While he's not the main focus of the article, his role as the wealthy patriarch who impregnates the housemaid is described as a key plot point that drives the vengeance narrative.",,"Lee Jung-jae's Dark Role in ""The Housemaid"" Makes Time's Top Revenge Films","Before Squid Game fame, Lee Jung-jae portrayed a manipulative patriarch in the acclaimed Korean thriller that earned global recognition",Acting,Film,"The article discusses Lee Jung-jae's acting role in the film ""The Housemaid"" and its recognition by Time magazine as a top revenge film, focusing on his performance as a manipulative patriarch in this Korean thriller, predating his Squid Game fame."

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3647,‘New World’ a well-made noir with superb acting,2013-02-11,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2013/02/11/20130211000236_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Noted screenwriter Park Hoon-jung’s second feature film was finally unveiled to the press last week, featuring three heavyweight actors ― Choi Min-sik, Hwang Jeong-min and Lee Jung-jae ― in the lead. What the film deals with is nothing new, at least in Korean cinema: a criminal organization, its gangsters and the cops who try to chase them down. However, Park, who is best known for his screenplays for Kim Ji-woon’s “I Saw the Devil” and Ryu Seung-wan’s “The Unjust,” managed to create a heartless and entertaining flick about power, greed and betrayal. “New World” is, in Park’s own words, “a film about gangsters doing politics, in suits and ties.” While doing exactly that, Park skillfully blurs the boundary between the police and gangsters, as well as the good and the bad. The police headquarters abuse their low-ranking officers while trying to do the righteous thing ― arresting the criminals. Some of the gangsters, on the other hand, share genuine camaraderie with each other ― while committing all kinds of illegal deeds. The thriller tells the story of police detective Ja-seong (Lee Jung-jae), who is assigned by his manipulative boss Kang (Choi Min-sik) to an undercover investigation into “Gold Moon” ― one of the biggest crime organizations in the country. Kang asks Ja-seong to spy on the gang’s second-in-command Jeong Cheong (Hwang Jeong-min), after finding out both Ja-seong and the gangster are ethnic Chinese, on top of sharing the same hometown of Yeosu, South Jeolla Province. Ja-seong’s investigation goes on for eight years, and he eventually finds himself caught between Jeong, who calls him a “brother” and “trusts him with his life,” and his senior detective Park, who only uses him and never gives him the recognition he deserves. The film gets even more dramatic as the mob boss is suddenly killed in a car accident, and the group’s two opposing factions, one led by Jeong and the other by ruthless and vengeful member Lee (Park Seong-woong), vie for power. Detective Kang comes up with a cunning and dangerous plan to come between Jeong and Lee ― using Ja-seong’s trusted position in Jeong’s faction ― to break up the Gold Moon. Kang knows his project puts Ja-seong’s life at risk, but makes no plan to protect him if Ja-seong hits dire straits. Hwang Jeong-min (“The Unjust,” “You Are My Sunshine,”) is impressive as Jeong Cheong, who is arguably the most likable character in the film. The gangster is a lot of things ― he is an ethnic minority, a caring boss and a competent, thorough individual. During the press conference, Hwang said he only remembers “having fun” while playing Jeong, whom he described as a “chameleon.” “Jeong Cheong is really something,” he said. “He’s very versatile and has many different qualities and characteristics that make him unique.” Respected veteran actor Choi Min-sik (“I Saw the Devil,” “Oldboy”) is also convincing as the manipulative villain, while Lee Jung-jae (“The Thieves,” “The Housemaid”) presents a credible portrayal of a victim who is conflicted between two different worlds, against his own will. “Ja-seong doesn’t really start nor do anything by his own will,” Lee said. “He just gets caught up in things. He is not allowed to show his emotions, while required to tell lies all the time. I somehow had to deliver his real emotions in spite of his difficult situation, and that was the biggest challenge while playing this character.” Actor Park Seong-woong is also a presence in the film, as the charismatic, ruthless gangster who meets an unfortunate end. “New World” is an engaging noir with resounding acting and a highly entertaining narrative. Ultimately, it is a film about power and how it blinds those in authority, and those who strive for it. A New Entertainment World release, “New World” opens in local theaters on Feb. 21.

Choi Min-sik (“Oldboy,” “I Saw the Devil”), Lee Jung-jae (“The Thieves,” “The Housemaid”), and Hwang Jeong-min (“The Unjust,” “You Are My Sunshine”) are returning to the big screen next month in a crime thriller directed by Park Hun-jeong. The thriller tells the story of police detective Ja-seong (Lee Jung-jae), who is assigned by his boss Park (Choi Min-sik) to do an undercover investigation into “Gold Moon,” one of the biggest crime organizations in the country. Ja-seong disguises himself as one of the gang’s members. The investigation goes on for eight years, and Ja-seong finds himself caught between the gang’s second-in-command Jeong Cheong (Hwang Jeong-min), who “trusts him with his life,” and his senior detective Park, who uses Ja-seong for his own success. The film deals with the themes of betrayal and loyalty, as well as conspiracy. Park was one of the writers for Kim Ji-woon’s 2010 film “I Saw the Devil,” which starred Choi Min-sik as a serial killer. The two met during the production phase of the film, and Park told Choi about some of the scripts he was working on at the time, including the “New World.” Choi was impressed and promised to star in the films. “I felt like this guy had something,” Choi said through the promoters. “All of the scripts sounded interesting. But it seemed like ‘New World’ would attract the investors the most.” It was also Choi who brought actor Lee Jung-jae into the project. “It was actually Choi who called me and asked me to read over the script,” said Lee. “He sounded almost as if he were producing this film. Of course, I was really excited to work with someone as great as Choi.” Meanwhile, Hwang had to learn Chinese for his role as Jeong Cheong, who is a descendent of Chinese migrants who settled in Korea’s Jeolla provinces. “The role required me to speak in Chinese for a number of scenes,” Jeong said. “Learning Chinese was certainly more challenging than mastering the Jeolla accent.” “New World” opens in local theaters on Feb. 21.

The Korean heist film “The Thieves” became the fourth best-selling Korean film of all time, beating “Haeundae,” a disaster drama that opened three years ago, according to the latest official box office tally.
“The Thieves,” featuring 10 Korean and Chinese thieves teaming up to steal a valuable diamond necklace at a Macao casino, had attracted about 11.5 million viewers as of Wednesday, the data from the Korean Film Council showed.
The movie passed the 11.4 million audience record for “Haeundae,” pushing it down to the fifth spot on the list of the top 10 homegrown films that have hit the local box office.
Industry watchers say, if the current pace of ticket sales continues, “The Thieves” will soon likely overtake the third most-watched Korean film, “Taegukgi” (2003), which attracted more than 11.7 million viewers.
“The Host,” a 2006 action-packed thriller by director Bong Jun-ho, drew the most viewers at 13 million. The No. 2 film is “The King and the Clown” with 12 million.
Directed by Choe Dong-hoon, who is known for “Tazza: the High Rollers” and “The Big Swindle,” and starring top actors and actresses Jun Ji-hyun, Kim Hye-soo, Kim Yun-seok and Lee Jung-jae, “The Thieves” opened on July 25 and is now being shown on 552 cinema screens across the country.
Meanwhile, the movie will be released throughout Asia in the coming months, according to its distributor.
The film will be shown in Hong Kong, Indonesia and Singapore next month and open up in theaters in Malaysia, Thailand and other Asian countries in October and November, Mediaplex Co. said on Tuesday. (Yonhap News)

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10368561,‘I’m more motivated than ever’,2012-07-29,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2012/07/29/20120729000632_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Actor Lee Jung-jae talks about his acting career, being single
Actor Lee Jung-jae was not used to playing “unattractive” characters, until he was given the role of a jealous thief in his latest film “The Thieves.”
“Director Choi Dong-hun asked me to be as unattractive and foolish as possible for the role,” Lee told the Korea Herald in an interview on Thursday.
“So I asked him: if you want this guy to be so unattractive, why did you cast an (attractive) actor like me? But as I got to know more about the character, I developed a lot of attachment to him. I don’t think the audience would hate the guy although he is a villain. It’s his flaws that really humanize him.”
Actor Lee Jung-jae poses for a photo prior to an interview with The Korea Herald on Thursday. (Chung Hee-cho/The Korea Herald)
The star-studded heist film directed by Choi Dong-hun has been a sensational hit since its release last week. It topped the box office chart on the day of its opening, beating Christopher Nolan’s Hollywood blockbuster “The Dark Knight Rises.” The film also drew more than two million viewers in just four days after the release, becoming the third Korean film to have done so after Bong Joon-ho’s 2006 disaster flick “The Host” and Shim Hyung-rae’s 2007 fantasy action film “D-War.”
In the movie, Lee plays Popeye, a base, jealous thief who gets involved in a project to steal a diamond worth $20 million in Macau ― along with nine other Chinese and Korean professional criminals. Among the 10 characters in the film ― played by some of the most celebrated stars including Kim Hye-soo, Jun Ji-hyun, and Kim Yun-suk ― Lee’s is perhaps the most unlikable; the thief who betrays his own colleague using low tricks and lies. The villain, however, lacks intelligence and tact, which ironically drew him to the character, says Lee.
“I can’t say I’ve always enjoyed acting,” says the actor.
“But nowadays I’ve really become interested in giving more nuanced and realistic portrayals of my characters, including Popeye. I would like to star in as many movies as possible. I’m more motivated than ever.”
The 39-year-old made his debut in 1993, after working as a fashion model for a number of years. He has starred in films of various genres. Some of his more successful works include his 1998 romance “An Affair”; 1999 drama “City of the Rising Sun”; and 2005 action “Typhoon.”
Yet the actor chose his 2008 period comedy “The Accidental Gangster and the Mistaken Courtesan,” which did not do well at the box office, as one of the most memorable films.
“A lot of people asked me why I even chose to star in the film,” says the actor.
“But no actor actually chooses a film thinking this one will not succeed. I had a lot of faith in the script, and everyone in the crew worked very hard. But things did not work out very well, starting from the pre-production period. And it really affected the final product. I’m still fond of the film because I know it could’ve been better and I am still convinced that the script is great.”
Lee is currently shooting a noir thriller titled “A New World,” with heavyweight actors Hwang Jeong-min (The Unjust, You Are My Sunshine) and Choi Min-sik (Old Boy, I Saw the Devil).
“It’s been really busy working with the two biggies on the scene,” Lee says.
“But I don’t think of it as a competition. It’s more important to have a good work chemistry with them and, ultimately, make a good film.”
Lee says a recent encounter with one of his fans in a restaurant inspired him to play as many roles as he can.
“She was a middle-aged server in a restaurant,” Lee says. “She told me, ‘I spend so much time watching TV while working. But I hardly get to see your face. You need to get out there and do more work.’ What she told me really hit me. It definitely motivated me more.”
The actor, who openly dated actress Kim Min-hee from 2003 to 2006 and has been rumored to be romantically linked with Lim Sae-ryung, the ex-wife of Samsung Group heir apparent Lee Jae-yong, has been telling the media that he is happy being single.
The actor says he enjoys art exhibitions, ballet performances and music concerts when he’s off work, and often hangs out with his best friend, actor Jung Woo-sung ― who is also single.
Asked to comment on the famous line from the much-talked about TV show “A Gentleman’s Dignity,” which tells the life and friendship of four successful single men in their 40s, Lee gives an honest answer. In the show, one of the characters at one point says he isn’t interested in getting married mainly because “he does not want to share his hard-earned money with his wife and children.”
“Yes, I’ve certainly thought of it that way (about marriage),” says Lee.
“But doesn’t every man think that way at some point in their lives? I’m sure they do!”
