https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10016786,Speak or not to speak? K-pop stars face dilemma amid national crisis,2024-12-10,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/12/10/20241210050051_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"After the shocking but brief martial law declared by President Yoon Suk Yeol on Dec. 3, several celebrities, including K-pop singers, have voiced — or at least hinted at — their stance on the ongoing political crisis. Speaking out on political matters has long been a taboo for idols, whose freedom of expression is often tightly controlled by their agencies. However, with the rise of social media and the globalization of K-pop, the question emerges: Should K-pop singers be restricted from sharing their opinions on politics and social issues?
Trot singer Lim Young-woong, who is not a K-pop idol, found himself in hot water for an alleged exchange with an internet user regarding the impeachment of Yoon. Lim had posted a picture with his dog on social media, celebrating the pet’s birthday on the day the National Assembly voted on the impeachment motion. When a netizen criticized him for being “insensitive” during a national crisis, Lim reportedly responded, “Am I a politician? Why should I speak up?”
However, his agency could not confirm whether the account in question belonged to Lim.
In contrast, K-pop singer Lee Chae-yeon, a former member of the girl group IZ*ONE, expressed her views more openly on Saturday. While discussing the anti-Yoon protests held in Seoul on a fan communication platform, Lee challenged the notion that idols should stay apolitical.
“Not in a position to talk about politics? Then what exactly is the ‘right’ position to talk about it?” she wrote. “As a citizen and a member of society, I’ll decide for myself when and what to speak up about. I’m using my voice because I’m an entertainer.”
Lee’s remarks were widely praised for their courage, in stark contrast to criticisms against Lim for staying silent.
Cha Eun-woo of the boy band Astro also became a target of online backlash after posting fashion shoot photos on Saturday. Some netizens attacked him for being tone-deaf during the country’s political turmoil, leaving comments such as, “Is this appropriate given the current state of the country?” and “Be more aware; don’t you watch the news?”
Others defended Cha, arguing that sharing personal content on social media is an individual choice and that such criticisms were unwarranted.
Industry insiders suggest that K-pop singers face significant risks when engaging in political discourse and that staying apolitical may be the safest route.
“When artists engage in political or national issues, while they certainly have the freedom to express their opinions, they must also consider that their business relies heavily on communication with fans,” said a K-pop agency official, who requested anonymity. “There is no need for them to publicly align with a specific political stance.”
Stephanie Choi, a postdoctoral researcher at the State University of New York at Buffalo, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing that K-pop singers often have more to lose than to gain by speaking out.
“Fans often support celebrities in the hopes of reflecting and amplifying their own political stances. However, remaining silent or inactive can also be interpreted as a form of political action,” Choi told The Korea Herald on Tuesday. “Celebrities will always be under public scrutiny regarding their political views.”
Choi added that K-pop singers face additional challenges compared to their American counterparts due to differences in market size.
“Despite K-pop’s global popularity, the market remains relatively small compared to, for instance, the US music market. This limits the freedom Korean celebrities have to openly align with a particular political stance and cultivate a niche following within a broad global audience,” Choi said. “It is safer for them to remain apolitical to maintain their broadest fanbase.”",chaeunwoo,5.0,"The article directly discusses Cha Eun-woo by name, specifically mentioning the backlash he received for posting fashion shoot photos during a political crisis.

It is no surprise that Cha has often generated buzz in the entertainment news section and among fans of Korean music and drama. But in recent days, his name was mentioned multiple times among a most unexpected group of people here: politicians. It started with the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea’s decision last week to nominate its deputy spokesperson Ahn Gwi-ryeong to run in the upcoming April 10 general election. The 35-year-old news anchor-turned-politician was tapped to run for Dobong-gu, which has long been a stronghold for the progressive bloc. Controversy began brewing when critics started to point out that she was widely perceived to be an aide and supporter of the party’s current leader, Lee Jae-myung. Some within the party, including former Dobong-gu district chief Lee Dong-jin, criticized what he saw was the party favoring pro-Lee members in the candidate selection process. It was then when YouTube footage of Ahn playing a game of “ideal type world cup,” which is a tournament-style game in which the guest chooses the ideal celebrity they would most like to date, on a Channel A talk show, went viral. In the game, Ahn eventually chooses the main opposition leader over Cha, which drew a jokingly annoyed reaction from the interviewers. The footage was forgotten until the rival and ruling People Power Party Interim Chair Han Dong-hoon decided to comment on it. “If there was a candidate in the People Power Party who told me I (looked better) than Cha Eun-woo then they would never be nominated,” he told reporters as he was entering the National Assembly on Monday. “It seems Lee’s Democratic Party has become a jungle, where only brownnosers who can pick Lee’s nose for him on his behalf and say that he looks better than Cha Eun-woo can survive,” he added, while recalling separate 2022 video footage of Democratic Party Rep. Park Chan-dae seemingly picking Lee’s nose for him. Ahn soon fired back at Han, saying that he was taking things too seriously. “It is not Han’s job to turn an entertainment variety show into a documentary or bad- mouth the main opposition party,” she told reporters a few hours later. “I hope he focuses on improving the livelihoods of the people rather than on such bickering,” she added. The issue gained further momentum on Tuesday, when Democratic Party Rep. Park Beom-kye addressed the matter in a radio interview, saying that Ahn should thank Han for throwing her into the spotlight ahead of the election. Cha’s agency Fantagio was unavailable for comment.",chaeunwoo,3.0,"While Cha Eun-woo is mentioned multiple times in the article, he's not the main focus but rather serves as a reference point in a political discussion.

I talked with the director and we agreed that action scenes including car chases would be performed by a stunt double. But we had the discussion again on the set and I decided to perform the scenes myself to create a better film,"" Kim said. Jung Sang-hoon, who performed the car chase scene with Kim also shared his experience. Jung played a reporter character who provides an element of humor to the otherwise serious action movie. “As Rae-won said, stunt doubles were all ready to perform as we had some dangerous car crash scene. I actually had some fears,” Jung added. “Rae-won suggested we do the actions. Although I had fears, I performed with him because -- although it may not seem so -- I am ‘hyeong’ (an honorific Korean term meaning older brother). So I could not freak out, and did it with him,"" Jung added jokingly.

If the noise level surpasses 100 decibels, the countdown time left on the bomb diminishes by half. The former navy commander desperately tries to stop the terrorist attacks but the caller keeps on threatening him, saying that the bomb can also hurt his wife and daughter. The director said he came up with the special bomb to make the film more dramatic. “A bomb that reacts to sound is different from ordinary bombs. It adds one more element that the protagonist cannot control,” the director said. Lee Jong-suk, who played the mysterious caller, talked about what he focused on in playing a villain for the first time. “It is a villainous character that is different from characters that I have played in the past. I think he is not just a villain because he has a deep sorrow. I tried to make him a more three-dimensional character,” Lee said. Cha Eun-woo of K-pop boyband Astro, who played one of the Navy personnel who got on board with Do-young also shared his experience being part of the project. This was his movie debut. “Rae-won told me that when watching a film for the first time, actors tend to focus only on their own performance and that it would be better if I could enjoy the film while looking at the big picture. I took his advice and watched the film comfortably.” Unlike dramas, Cha said he could monitor his performance and have a discussion after each take while filming “Decibel.” “We could check the roughly edited version on the set and everyone could make suggestions to make the scene better. It was an interesting experience,” Cha added. “When I filmed dramas, we had to rush sometimes. It was different for the movie and I could learn a lot from it.” The K-pop singer-turned-actor also sang one of the songs in the film’s original soundtrack album. “I sang the song while thinking about my character Tae-ryong’s point of view. Today, I heard the song as the closing music for the movie and it was touching.” Toward the end of the conference, actor Kim briefly talked about releasing a film after the tragic crowd disaster in Itaewon. “Because of what happened recently, I am careful to say this but the situation for theaters is difficult.

The six-member act held a press conference in Seoul on Monday afternoon, a few hours ahead of the album’s release. Member MJ, real name Kim Myung-jun, started his military service last Monday and was absent from the event. “Drive to the Starry Road” marks the band’s return after a nearly nine-month hiatus, after dropping its eighth EP “Switch On” in August. The group’s last studio album “All Yours” was released in April 2021. “We received a huge amount of love last year with the LP and the EP, and we’re returning confident with fresh sounds again. As it’s our third LP, we’ve put much care into preparing the album and we’ve included our solo songs for the first time,” the act’s leader JinJin said. Encompassing an expansive 11 tracks, the album is tinted deep with the unique colors of the group and its members as they tell of the past, present and future shared with their fans, Aroha. “The album portrays the path Astro has walked with our fans until now and the road we have ahead of us. It says that we’ve walked a starry road, which will continue to await us in the future,” Cha Eun-woo said. Fronting the album is “Candy Sugar Pop,” a dance tune overflowing with fresh and sweet sentiments. Members JinJin, Moonbin and Rocky took part in writing the lyrics. “We believe our strength is with the fresh concept, but hopefully we can also spell out our dynamic charms with the solo songs,” Cha Eun-woo explained. Listed on the album are four other group songs -- “Something Something,” “More,” “Light the Sky” and “Like Stars” -- as well as each member’s solo songs: MJ’s “Story”; JinJin’s “All Day”; Cha Eun-woo’s “First Love”; Moonbin’s “Let’s Go Ride”; Rocky’s “S#1” and Yoon Sanha’s “24 Hours.” “The songs represent the unique colors the members have discovered over the past seven years,” JinJin said, adding, “preparing a full-length album always comes with some pressure, but seeing the result, we’re more than satisfied.” Regarding the bandmates attempting solo songs for the LP, Rocky said, “We’ve each worked hard on honing ourselves on lyric-writing and composing. We thought that we were all now prepared enough to take charge of a single song alone and decided to include solo songs in this album.” Following the album’s release, Astro is holding concerts on May 28-29 at the Jamsil Indoor Stadium in Olympic Park, southern Seoul. “As people driven by the energy we get from our performances, we’ve really missed interacting with the fans. It’s a huge joy that we could be with the fans now that the (coronavirus) situation has eased. We’re working hard for the concert as well, so please look forward to it,” JinJin said. Moonbin added, “As it’s our first concert in three years, we’re as nervous as we are excited. We’re looking forward to performing live in front of the audience the songs from our albums that we’ve only showed online.” On their goals with the comeback, JinJin said, “Our goal is topping the charts, and we’re quite confident.” Wrapping up the event, Sanha defined “Drive to the Starry Road” in one word as a “dessert.” “The title song is addictive, and we hope people want to keep on listening to it, just like a dessert.”",chaeunwoo,4.0,"The article is highly relevant to Cha Eun-woo as it discusses ASTRO's album release where he is a key member.

According to the OED, aegyo is used to describe the “charm and cuteness, especially of a sort considered characteristic of Korean popular culture.” It means behavior regarded as cute, charming or adorable as well. The word is commonly used in association with adorable babies or cute pets. Traditionally, aegyo is associated with women making cute gestures, speaking in high pitched voices and using the third person, but the word has taken on a new meaning as a wider range of television celebrities are showcasing their aegyo, regardless of their gender or age. Many talk show and variety programs, including MBC Every 1’s “Weekly Idol,” even have dedicated segments during which celebrities can freely demonstrate their aegyo, hoping to charm viewers. “Ottoke Song,” (unofficial translation) created to showcase aegyo, is widely used by television celebrities when asked to show aegyo to fans. Because the music naturally allows even veteran actors and artists, who typically have strong personalities and aloof manners, to show off their charming sides, it has become part of regular many programs‘ music repertoire. While actor Cha Sun-woo and singer Key of Shinee showed off their versions of “Ottoke Song” in a recent online fan meeting and radio program, respectively, actor Cha Eun-woo performed the song in the tvN drama “True Beauty” to win the female character’s heart. As the impact of aegyo became more pronounced, making special gestures, like a finger heart, during an interview, press conference and award ceremonies became part of a routine for the Korean celebrities. Aegyo provides a chance for entertainers to close the distance and build an intimate relationship with their fans, while keeping their true personalities – and the risks associated with revealing too much -- mostly hidden from the public. In K-pop, most idols perform aegyo for their fans as a way of selling intimacy and maintaining close relationship with them. In the ever-growing K-pop market, 62 K-pop idol groups made their debut this year, bringing to total 150 new bands in the last three years. With competition like that, only a few can succeed. And amazing vocals, addictive hit songs and spectacular dance moves aside, aegyo has become another necessary element for an idol group to survive the fierce competition. After her debut as a member of K-pop girl group Girl’s Day, Hyeri rose to instant stardom after showing her aegyo on MBC’s hit reality show “Real Man,” a program that follows the life celebrities as they join the army as new conscripts, in 2014. Star director Shin Won-ho later revealed that he decided to cast Hyeri for Deok-sun’s role in tvN’s hit series “Reply 1988” after watching the singer’s aegyo on full display in variety shows such as “Real Man.” In “Reply 1988,” Hyeri’s first drama, she came to represent the series as a lead character. “Cheer Up,” Twice’s breakthrough song, became a national sensation in 2016, bringing the band multiple awards and trophies. The addictive chorus played a huge role in the song’s success, but the public recognition of Twice skyrocketed as Sana made countless media appearances, singing her famous line in the song, “shy shy shy.” By Lee Si-jin ()",chaeunwoo,4.0,"The article directly mentions Cha Eun-woo (referred to both as Cha Sun-woo and Cha Eun-woo) performing the ""Ottoke Song"" in the drama ""True Beauty"" as an example of aegyo in Korean entertainment.
