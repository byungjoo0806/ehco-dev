Netflix Korea's latest sensation, ""When Life Gives You Tangerines,"" was officially the platform's most popular non-English series as of Friday.
The series, which traces the turbulent lives of the characters in Korea from the 1960s to present day, is making waves globally — a feat that carries unique significance compared to other global Korean hits such as ""Squid Game"" and ""The Glory.""
Unlike its megahit predecessors, ""When Life Gives You Tangerines"" is deeply rooted in Korean culture and history, showcasing traditional customs, gender roles of the 1960s and rural life on Jeju Island.
Characters speak in heavy dialects and the narrative is rich with cultural references, such as the ""haenyeo,"" or female divers who harvest seafood from the ocean, and old Korean songs that serve as its soundtrack in accordance with the show’s timeline.
Small details in scenes, such as women boarding ships being considered taboo and the belief that women should not place their shoes on the doorstep, also reflect deep-rooted Korean superstitions.
""It's amazing,"" said Park Bo-gum, the Hallyu star playing the younger version of the two leads in the series, in a group interview March 24, when asked about what he thought about the series' success on the global charts. The series, which premiered March 7, had reached the No. 2 spot on Netflix's non-English series chart in the third week of March.
""It's fascinating and surprising that stories of human connections and family, infused with Korean sentiment, can resonate even in (other) countries,"" he said.
On paper, such deeply Korean elements might seem challenging for international audiences to connect with.
While star power may have contributed to the series' global success — with Hallyu stars Lee Ji-eun (better known as singer IU) and Park Bo-gum leading the cast — fans point to the drama's universal themes of love and family to explain its appeal.
Nadia, 27, a white-collar worker in New York, shared how the smallest details resonated with her.
""There are many scenes that remind me of my parents, which keep me invested in the series,"" she said. ""Moments as simple as my parents refusing to spend the money I send them hit close to home, making me see the characters' stories as my own.""
Sid Patel, 26, a graduate student in India, found the drama series refreshing for its blend of unfamiliar cultural elements and relatable family narratives.
""I love watching K-drama, but I knew little about Jeju Island or Korean traditions before this. Seeing them interwoven into a story I could personally relate to — especially parents sacrificing everything so that their children can achieve what they dream — made for a unique viewing experience,"" he said.
Experts add that the universally resonating themes being conveyed through impeccable pacing further contributes to the show's popularity.
""Family dramas hold the greatest potential for success, regardless of nationality,"" said pop culture critic Jung Ji-ouk. ""The fact that the whole family can watch it together and that it tells a family's story gives it a sense of universality.""
""Rather than having the plot move rapidly, focusing solely on events, or dragging on like a daily drama, causing emotional exhaustion, (the series) presents emotionally impactful scenes and then offers a moment of respite before moving on to the next,"" said Park Ki-soo, a professor in the department of culture content at Hanyang University.
""After an emotional high, it ensures there’s enough space for what we call emotional aftershocks to settle. This makes the drama linger with the audience for a longer time.""
Additionally, the series employs timeless narrative motifs that resonate across cultures.
Ae-sun's journey, for instance, echoes the classic ""The Little Princess,"" the 1905 children's novel about Sara Crewe, a young girl who endures hardship and displacement after being orphaned.
""Ae-sun's journey begins with the loss of both parents, leaving her to be passed from house to house, almost like an unwanted burden,"" said Park.
""This is a very common motif. A heroine facing hardship after losing her parents echoes stories like 'The Little Princess,' naturally evoking emotional resonance,"" said Park. ""For the older generation watching this drama, such experiences were quite common in their time.""
Meanwhile, the Hanyang University professor added that Park Bo-gum's character embodies another familiar trope: the steadfast childhood friend who becomes a protector, reminiscent of the ""tall, kind uncle"" archetype from 1912 epistolary novel ""Daddy-Long-Legs,"" which continues to resonate with female audiences.
""As the universal aspect of family and the other universal codes are intertwined, there are definitely elements in ('When Life Gives You Tangerines') that people viewing from a global perspective can relate to,"" said Park.",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU (Lee Ji-eun) briefly as part of the cast of the series ""When Life Gives You Tangerines,"" but the focus is primarily on the show's themes, cultural impact, and global appeal rather than her specific contributions as a singer, songwriter, or actress.

Netflix latest K-drama hit “When Life Gives You Tangerines,” starring IU and Park Bo-gum, puts a spotlight on the lives of the diving women of Jeju Island, haenyeo.
Set in 1960s Jeju Island, the drama, which premiered on March 7, has quickly gained traction, ranking sixth in global TV show viewership on the platform as of Wednesday, according to ranking site FlixPatrol. It topped the charts in 13 countries, including South Korea and several Asian and Middle Eastern nations. The original Korean title, “Boksak Sogassuda,” derived from the Jeju dialect, translates to “You’ve worked hard.”
Earlier in the series, protagonist Ae-soon’s mother, Gwang-rye, played by Yum Hye-ran, continues diving to provide for her daughter despite a debilitating lung condition, all while insisting that Ae-soon, played by IU, never follow in her footsteps. The mother dies, leaving 10-year-old Ae-soon behind. In a pivotal moment in episode 4, a now-grown-up Ae-soon confronts her in-laws, who insist that her daughter become a haenyeo.
Literally translated as ""sea woman,"" haenyeo have been a rich source of inspiration for Korean storytellers, sparking a variety of works across different art forms. Several TV dramas set in Jeju have featured haenyeo.
Last year’s JTBC drama “Welcome to Samdalri” featured haenyeo leader Go Mi-ha, played by Kim Mi-kyung, who shared the wisdom of the divers' way of life. One of her lines resonated deeply:
“There is one thing we always emphasize when training young divers: Don’t be greedy. Stay underwater only for as long as your breath allows. The sea may seem calm, but it is full of hidden dangers. When you can’t hold on any longer, return to the surface and catch your breath.”
Another drama, tvN’s “Our Blues,” also highlighted the lives of haenyeo. The omnibus series, which aired in 2022, showcased the breathtaking scenery of Jeju while depicting the intertwined stories of its residents. Actress Han Ji-min played Lee Young-ok, a first-year haenyeo who moved from the mainland to Jeju.
The 2016 film “Canola” is a human drama that tells the story of Jeju haenyeo Gye-chun, played by Youn Yuh-jung, who miraculously reunites with her granddaughter Hye-ji, played by Kim Go-eun, after 12 years. The story follows the two as they navigate life together again in Gye-chun’s home on Jeju Island.
Beyond fictional portrayals, haenyeo have also been a subject of documentaries. Released in October last year, “The Last of the Sea Women” captures the fading reality of the haenyeo community through the lives of real divers. The film premiered in the documentary section of the 49th Toronto International Film Festival and was later invited to the Busan International Film Festival. Korean American director Sue Kim, inspired by an 84-year-old haenyeo she met in Jeju, documented their lives after hearing the diver remark that they might be the last generation of haenyeo.
In real life, haenyeo's presence on Jeju Island is dwindling. According to a report from the Jeju government, the number of active haenyeo dropped to 2,838 in 2023, down from 3,226 in 2022 — a decrease of 387. This marks a sharp decline from 1970, when Jeju had over 14,000 haenyeo.",iu,5.0,"The article specifically mentions IU (아이유) as the lead actress in the K-drama ""When Life Gives You Tangerines,"" which aligns with her occupation as a singer, songwriter, and actress.

One of most highly anticipated Netflix Korea series of 2025, ""When Life Gives You Tangerines,"" starring Hallyu titans Park Bo-gum and Lee Ji-eun, better known to K-pop fans as IU, is poised to move audiences with its touching exploration of life and love.
Premiering this week, the series set on Jeju Island follows the romantic narrative of Ae-soon (Lee) and Gwan-sik (Park). The series sees the characters and their relationship later in life as well, with the middle-aged roles portrayed by acclaimed actor Moon So-ri and Squid Game star Park Hae-soo, respectively.
The new series also boasts a stellar lineup behind the camera, with Lim Sang-chun of “When the Camellia Blooms” and “Fight for My Way” penning the script and director Kim Won-seok of “Misaeng,” “Signal” and “My Mister” helming the series.
Reported to have cost a whopping 60 billion won ($41 million) to produce, Kim, though unsure of the precise figures, acknowledged the significant financial and creative resources that went into the series.
""Much of the budget was allocated to the visual elements and filming-related components. We built an open set, which alone cost a substantial amount,"" he said at a press conference in Yeouido, Seoul, Wednesday.
""As the story spans decades, from the 1960s to 2025, we invested heavily in art to make it realistic, and even employed VFX (visual effects) technology to make it appear authentic,"" he added.
While the series was initially conceptualized with Korean audiences in mind, the involvement of Netflix has broadened its scope, Kim said.
""At first, I envisioned the series for a domestic audience, but once it was picked up by Netflix, I wondered how it could resonate globally,"" added Kim.
""We focused on ensuring that Korean-specific references and lines would be effectively conveyed to international viewers through accurate subtitles. I think things such as the Korean War, the plight of refugees and the 1997 financial crisis would not be difficult for international audiences to understand,"" he said.
Lee, returning to the small screen for the first time in six years since her role in ""Hotel Del Luna,"" shared that the English title of the series encapsulates the show's core essence. The title, a twist on the American adage ""When life gives you lemons, make lemonade,"" replaces lemons with Jeju Island's regional specialty.
""The English title, 'When Life Gives You Tangerines,' reflects the idea that even if life presents you with bitter tangerines, you can transform them into tangerine syrup and enjoy a warm cup of tangerine tea,"" Lee said. ""We see this drama as a warm cup of tangerine tea for our viewers, hoping it will offer a moment of calm reflection on life.""
The first four episodes of ""When Life Gives You Tangerines"" will be available for streaming on Netflix on Friday, with four new episodes releasing weekly. The series is to consist of 16 episodes unveiled over four weeks.

Korean Canadian singer JK Kim Dong-uk, also known as John Kim, said via social media on Saturday that his freedom of speech is being violated, after an internet user filed a lawsuit accusing him of engaging in political activities as a foreign national.
Kim has openly supported President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was formally arrested Sunday in connection to his declaration of martial law last month, and has called for the withdrawal of his impeachment, both online and offline.
Under the Immigration Control Act, foreign nationals residing in South Korea are prohibited from participating in political activities unless otherwise permitted by law. Violators may face orders from the Ministry of Justice to cease political activities or even deportation, though such actions are rare.
“This is the first time in my life I’ve been accused,” Kim wrote on social media. “Did I hold a large-scale rally on Jan. 3? That must be a mistake.” Kim has posted a photo of himself attending a rally in opposition to Yoon's arrest in front of the presidential residence in Hannam-dong, Seoul, on Jan. 3.
“I’m curious when South Korea, a free nation, became a country that suppresses freedom of expression,” he added.
On Friday, an internet user revealed on social platform X that JK Kim Dong-uk is expected to be accused of violating the prohibition on political activities by foreigners.
“JK Kim Dong-uk, who renounced his Korean citizenship and acquired Canadian citizenship, is considered a foreign national. According to Article 17 of the Immigration Control Act, foreigners residing in Korea are prohibited from engaging in political activities, and violation could result in penalties,” the online commenter said.
The commenter alleged that Kim repeatedly posted opposition to Yoon’s impeachment on his social media and said that the singer organized a large rally near the presidential residence on Jan. 3, sharing related content online.
Kim, who was born in Seoul, immigrated to Canada in 1992 during his sophomore year of college. While his music career is based in South Korea, his Canadian citizenship exempted him from mandatory military service and denies him voting rights in the country.
The singer has emerged as one of the most vocal supporters of Yoon in the entertainment industry, alongside singer Kim Heung-gook and actor Choi Joon-yong.
JK Kim Dong-uk has consistently criticized calls for Yoon’s impeachment, stating on social media, “The Democratic Party lacks democracy, the judiciary lacks justice, and intellectuals lack knowledge.”
After an initial temporary arrest warrant was issued for Yoon on Wednesday, Kim wrote, “The will of patriotic citizens defending freedom within the framework of the law in a constitutional state will resonate worldwide, standing in stark contrast to the pro-North Korea forces who have lost reason and disregard the law.”
The controversy has drawn attention to another celebrity, IU, who has come under fire from far-right internet users for what they say is her political involvement.
Last month, IU, who is a Korean citizen, prepaid for food and drinks at coffee shops near Yeouido in Seoul, the site of impeachment rallies against Yoon following his Dec. 3 martial law declaration. The food was distributed to rally attendees on a first-come, first-served basis.
IU’s social media accounts have since been flooded with both criticism and support from users who are divided over her actions.",iu,3.0,"The article briefly mentions IU in the context of political involvement, but the primary focus is on JK Kim Dong-uk's legal issues. IU is referenced as a Korean citizen (correct sex/occupation) and her actions are tangentially related to political rallies, but the article does not center on her career as a singer, songwriter, or actress.

Trot singer Lim Young-woong has been named the top artist in the K-Brand Index for 2024, according to the Asia Brand Research Institute on Monday.
The K-Brand Index, a big data evaluation system developed by the institute, uses a panel of experts for verification, from extracting candidate samples to selecting indices, ensuring reliability.
This year’s artist category was determined by analyzing 5.64 billion online data points collected from Jan. 1 to Nov. 30. The evaluation included the top 30 solo artists and K-pop groups based on search volume from major portal sites.
Lim secured first place in the rankings, followed by another trot singer Lee Chan-won in second, IU in third, Rose of Blackpink in fourth and Jang Won-young of Ive in fifth. Other notable mentions in the top 10 included Jennie of Blackpink, Jung Dong-won, Jimin of BTS, Ahn Yu-jin of Ive and Jungkook of BTS.
The K-Brand Index calculates scores by integrating trends, media presence, social media activity, community engagement and sentiment analysis, excluding weight biases.
""The key issues in the music industry this year can be summarized as the 'establishment of trot as a central genre' and 'independent activities by idols,'"" Ryu Won-sun, the head of the research center at the Asia Brand Research Institute, said. “Trot is no longer a temporary craze but has become a foundation of the industry, while successful solo activities by BTS members Jimin and Jungkook, and Blackpink's Rose and Jennie, have reaffirmed K-pop's global presence.""

""The Snowman"" by Jung Seung-hwan
One of Korea's most beloved young ballad singers, Jung Seung-hwan, evokes images of a snow-covered landscape with the fairytale-like melody of “The Snowman.”
Released on Feb. 19, 2018, as a pre-release track from his first full-length album “And Spring,” the song's music video features the serene snowy scenery of Hokkaido, Japan.
Beginning with the gentle sound of bells and an acoustic guitar, the song builds layers of piano, electric guitar and synth, blending harmoniously with Jung's deeply emotional vocals.
The poetic lyrics, from the perspective of a snowman watching the passing seasons, were written by IU. The sincere wish for another's happiness leaves a lasting impression: “Even if it takes time, please be sure to find happiness.”
""Walking in the Winter"" by Yun DDanDDan
Singer-songwriter Yun DDanDDan, known for his clear, tender voice and relatable lyrics, captured the season's cold yet refreshing air in “Walking in the Winter.”
""Walking in the Winter"" is a B-side track from the singer's debut album “Fifty-Fifty,” released in 2014.
This song's bittersweet lyrics about longing and regret for a past love contrast interestingly with its cheerful melodies and bright guitar. The lyrics vividly capture the narrator's raw emotions as he walks through the cold winter streets, reminiscing about a lost relationship.
To celebrate the song's 10th anniversary, Yun recently went back to the original filming locations of the music video and recreated the shots for social media.
""Snowball"" by Bol4
Known for the purity of her voice, singer-songwriter Bol4, also known as Ahn Ji-young, captures the cozy atmosphere of winter in her song “Snowball.”
Released on Dec. 12, 2023, as one of the two main tracks on the album “Merry Go Round,” the song was written and composed by Ahn herself.
While Bol4 has often sung about the warmth and freshness of spring and summer, “Snowball” marks her first winter-themed song. The music video beautifully showcases the snowy landscapes of Sapporo, Japan.
Introducing the song, Ahn explained, “I hate using clear themes like seasons, weather and places in vague, ambiguous ways.

Social media campaigns and boycotts have intensified, channeling public outrage in one of the world‘s most connected nations.
Singer IU, a K-pop singer and actor, has become a target of criticism from opponents of Yoon’s impeachment.
Her voluntary gesture of prepaying for food and hand warmers to support participants at a rally advocating for Yoon‘s impeachment has drawn significant criticism. Reports suggest that IU, along with other public figures, has been added to a “blacklist” allegedly compiled by Yoon’s supporters.
The “Yoon Suk Yeol Impeachment Support List” began circulating online last week, including IU and other celebrities, such as girl group NewJeans, filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, comedian Park Myung-soo and actor Go Ah-sung.
At the bottom of the image, it encourages reporting these individuals to the US Central Intelligence Agency, based on the spurious claim that being reported would prevent them from entering the United States.
One online user even posted a screenshot claiming to have reported IU to the CIA, urging others to participate in a “verification relay” by submitting similar reports.
The post, originally shared on the “People Power Party Gallery” of online forum DCInside, has since been deleted. Critics have dismissed the campaign as an embarrassing and absurd overreaction, with one commenter stating, “I don’t understand why people are resorting to such actions.”
Additionally, calls for boycotts against companies associated with IU have intensified. Lists of brands she has endorsement deals with, including Woori Bank and Hite Jinro, are being shared online with suggestions to stop buying products or services from the businesses.
On the other side, those supporting Yoon’s impeachment have launched a boycott against Purmil, a dairy company owned by the family of Rep. Yoon Sang-hyun’s wife.
Yoon Sang-hyun, a vocal opponent of the impeachment motion, has faced significant backlash. Critics accuse him and his family’s company of being complicit in insurrection, aligning their boycott with their broader political grievances.
Rep. Yoon, married to Shin Kyung-ah, a member of the family behind Purmil, has consistently opposed Yoon‘s impeachment.
On the day of the vote, he reaffirmed his stance, stating, “We cannot hand over power to the reckless Democratic Party led by Lee Jae-myung.”
His comments further fueled the campaign against Purmil.
Observers note that South Korea’s tendency to channel public sentiment into collective action has been magnified by social media. What begins as localized outrage can quickly escalate into nationwide campaigns, often fueled by misinformation, as seen with the CIA reporting claims, they said.
“Social media accelerates these dynamics,” said Choi Jong-ryul, a sociology professor at Keimyung University. “Outrage is no longer confined to political spheres -- it extends into cultural and economic realms, creating ripples that impact individuals and businesses alike.”

She made a striking entrance on a swing-like lift, dressed in a sparkling coral mini dress and a white headset, kicking off the show with “Holssi,” the first track from a captivating setlist that spanned over two hours. IU took an audience of 50,000 on a mesmerizing journey, performing “Ah Puh” amidst a stunning display of whale and jellyfish-shaped lanterns carried by dancers. While the open-air venue posed some challenges with sound delays that slightly detracted from the immersive experience, IU skillfully countered this with a variety of creative props and stage effects. The second section of the show began with a little girl awakening onstage, setting the scene for a magical moment when a star, carried by a drone, guided her to IU, who reappeared on the swing lift adorned with colorful flowers to sing “Celebrity.” She then flew over the venue to the stage front, where her fans, donning blue flower headpieces, surprised her during “Blueming.” “It’s wonderful to see you up close. Your affectionate gazes fill my heart with love. Thank you for this surprise event. I included this song just for this encore show,” IU said. She expressed her desire to perform “I Stan U” surrounded by her audience, adding, “Thank you for starting your autumn with my concert. Just as you cheer for me, I hope to be that kind of audience for you as well.” During the concert, IU also debuted a new song, “Bye Summer,” showcasing her skills on a crystal blue electric guitar. “This tour felt like summer lasted forever. However, I want to say it’s been the best summer because I shared it with all of you. This song feels fitting for a day that marks the end of summer,” she explained. The concert peaked with 1,000 drones illuminating the night sky during “Last Fantasy.” Dressed like a fairy tale princess wearing a flowing white gown and a crown, IU created a magical atmosphere enhanced by fireworks. A giant Tweety balloon, reminiscent of her “Shopper” music video, floated above as she performed the lead track from her latest EP ""The Winning."" As the concert drew to a close, IU reflected on the emotional weight of the moment. “This is the last moment of my world tour, and it makes me feel so sentimental. I hope you achieve victories, big and small, until we meet again,” she said, transitioning to “Love Wins All,” the final song on her setlist. Accompanied by an orchestra and a choir, her soulful performance left the audience mesmerized, inspiring clapping atypical of K-pop concerts.

But holding concerts at Seoul World Cup Stadium is being challenged by some soccer fans complaining that nonsports events there have crucial detrimental effects on the field. A self-proclaimed fan of Son Heung-min on Sept. 11 posted a petition on the state-run e-People website, calling for the cancellation of the K-pop superstar IU's concert slated for Sept. 21-22 in Seoul World Cup Stadium in Sangam-dong, Seoul. The petitioner claimed that the large crowd expected for the concert -- which sold out 100,000 tickets within minutes -- will damage the grass of the stadium that will be used for the qualifying matches of the upcoming 2026 World Cup. After playing Palestine on its home field on Sept. 5, South Korea will host the rest of its Group B opponents in the qualifiers slated until next year. But there have been multiple complaints from players, fans and even opposing teams about the poor conditions of the grass. ""A third-round qualifying match between South Korea and Iraq is slated in Sangam on Oct. 15, and (the authorities) should try their best to manage the grass there for remainder of (the World Cup qualifiers) period,"" the petitioner wrote. The person cited Seoul Metropolitan Government's Ordinance on the Installation and Operation of Seoul Sports Facilities, which in Article 5-3 states that the mayor may bar or even cancel use of a sports facility if they deem an event as possibly causing a hindrance to the management of the facility in question. Grass greener on other side The controversy started when national team captain Son-- who led his team's 3-1 road win over Oman with a go-ahead goal in the second half -- complained about the grass in the Seoul World Cup Stadium. He said the Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex's field being in good condition allowed him to play with more confidence, adding that he wishes such good management could be applied to Korea's home fields as well. After his team ended in a goalless draw against Palestine in Seoul, he claimed the grass had made things difficult for him to control the ball. The allegedly questionable grass conditions at the Seoul World Cup Stadium have long been an issue here. Former national team player Ki Sung-yueng in 2017 jokingly said that he was not worried about a road match in China, because the grass there ""could not possibly be worse than in Seoul."" In light of the concerns over grass, Seoul Facilities Corporation in October 2021 installed new turf comprised of 95 percent natural and 5 percent synthetic grass. Fewer events were held at the stadium since then compared to before, with the venue being concert-free for a full year since the new field was installed. But between the ongoing remodeling of the Seoul Olympic Main Stadium in Jamsil, southern Seoul and the Gocheok Sky Dome being occupied for the professional baseball league season, the World Cup Stadium has become virtually the only venue in Seoul to hold mega-sized concerts. The concerts of band Seventeen and singer Lim Young-woong were held in the stadium, each in April and May of this year, prior to the upcoming IU concert. Operators of the Seoul World Cup Stadium told the local media that warnings about the grass are notified to whoever rents the stadium, and those who rent it are mandated to restore any damages to the field. Grass access is also limited to the minimum number of personnel required to install the stage and conduct the events, they added. The performers themselves also make efforts to minimize damage to the grass, such as Lim not installing seats on the field. IU's agency also vowed to follow the policies by protecting the grass, disassembling the stage as soon as the concert ends, while keeping the grass hydrated and well-ventilated during the event. With concerns over the grass conditions in Sangam, the Korea Football Association is mulling whether to select a different venue for upcoming home matches. The officials, however, said player convenience should be considered in any potential change of venue, and vowed to come up with a solution as soon as possible before the next match in October. South Korea is currently playing to earn one of two direct World Cup berths allocated for the Group B teams in the third round of the Asian Qualifiers.

""Finding a venue is like finding a needle in a haystack,"" said an official from a music festival organizing agency. The official added that many performances that were originally scheduled for December to target the year-end are being pushed to January due to the shortage of venues. Another industry insider also commented on the severe shortage of performance venues. ""It is true that Seoul lacks big concert venues. While international artists often prefer larger venues, they have no choice but to perform in smaller, available spaces to fit their schedules."" The Music Concert Industry Association of Korea, established in March 2021 by 46 entertainment agencies and concert planning companies, announced last week it has launched a petition drive to address the shortage of performance venues in Seoul. The petition aims to pressure the government and the city of Seoul to establish temporary concert venues in the metropolitan area. The association proposes the creation of an integrated task force involving the government, city, sports industry and cultural sector to come up with solutions to the venue shortage issue. Are there really no large-scale concert venues in Korea? One of Seoul's most prominent large-scale venues, Jamsil Olympic Stadium – which can accommodate up to some 60,000 people – will not be able to function as a concert hall for the next few years. Starting in 2027, it will serve as an alternative venue for Jamsil Baseball Stadium, which is set to undergo expansion until 2031. Seoul World Cup Stadium in Sangam-dong, northwestern Seoul, which can hold up to 66,000 people, is primarily a dedicated soccer stadium, making it difficult to secure for concerts. Only a few artists, such as Lim Young-woong, Seventeen and IU, have managed to book the venue. Even when successful, they have faced criticism over potential damage to the soccer field. Other frequently used venues include the 15,000-seat KSPO Dome, originally a gymnastics venue for the 1988 Seoul Olympics, and the 20,000-seat Gocheok Sky Dome, Korea's first enclosed dome baseball stadium. The Olympic Hall, a popular music-specific concert venue located in Olympic Park in eastern Seoul, has only 3,000 seats, while the adjacent SK Handball Gymnasium can accommodate up to 5,000 people. In comparison to Japan, which has five venues with over 30,000 seats and more than 40 venues with more than 10,000 seats, Korea's concert venue infrastructure falls far short in both size and number. The emergence of global idol groups and popular trot singers has resulted in massive fan bases that can fill large concert venues, but the growing demand for more venues has been unmet. This lack of large concert venues has led to some top international artists -- including Taylor Swift -- to skip South Korea on their world tours. Additionally, since most large concert venues here are primarily sports facilities, government and sporting events are given priority, leaving very few dates available for concerts. ""The size of the venue is a measure of an artist's capability, but right now, Korean artists have no way to gauge their popularity beyond the 18,000-seat KSPO Dome,"" the insider explained. ""It would be great if there were venues for artists who attract between 20,000 and 50,000 fans,"" the insider further noted, pointing out the lack of a venue between the 18,000-capacity KSPO Dome and 60,000-capacity World Cup Stadium. The official added that using a sports facility as a concert venue requires significant preparation and investment. ""I understand that some sports stadiums overseas are designed to be easily converted into concert venues, with features like reversible surfaces to protect the turf and better sound equipment. However, since we perform in sports stadiums that weren't built with these considerations in mind, the cost of preparing for a concert is much higher."" Is construction the solution? Meanwhile, some argue that building large-scale venues is not the only solution. Pop music critic Lim Hee-yun pointed out that while the demand for concerts has indeed increased, the key question is whether this demand will be sustained in the future. ""It is true that there has been a significant rise in the number of festivals, concerts and international artists' tours, leading to a shortage of venues. However, constructing new venues requires substantial budget and given the uncertainty about future demand, careful consideration is necessary,"" Lim said. Lim referred to the recently failed K-Culture Valley project in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, highlighting the risks associated with large-scale venue projects. The K-Culture Valley project aimed to build a cutting-edge large-scale concert hall and studio on a 237,000-square-meter lot, approximately the size of 46 soccer fields, in Goyang, just outside Seoul. However, CJ LiveCity, the project developer, halted construction in April 2023 and its contract with Gyeonggi Province was terminated in July of this year, effectively ending the project. ""As K-pop grew explosively, there were numerous plans for arena venues. Local governments showed interest and invested in these projects. But we have started to see cases where these plans fizzled out. Ultimately, the most feasible option is to make use of existing venues,"" Lim assessed. Ilsan's Kintex and the Goyang Sports Complex are examples of existing venues being used for concerts. One of the most prominent venues, KSPO Dome, initially criticized for its inadequate sound system, has become a more fitting venue after remodeling and various improvements. This suggests that developing and enhancing existing facilities could also be a viable solution. Lim further emphasized the need to consider multipurpose spaces, noting that many overseas venues serve both as concert halls and sports facilities. ""Wembley Stadium in London is used both as a soccer stadium and a concert venue, and SoFi Stadium in LA serves as an NFL stadium and a concert venue. Globally iconic venues often have multipurpose functions, combining sports events with concerts.""",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU as one of the few artists who have managed to book large venues like Seoul World Cup Stadium, which is relevant to her career as a singer.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3444938,[Drama Tour] Feel ‘My Mister’ mood in Yongsan,2024-08-03,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/08/01/20240801050856_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Yongsan-gu in central Seoul is one of the go-to spots for both local and overseas travelers. The district became popular for its Itaewon neighborhood -- where people can experience and enjoy a variety of international cultures -- many years ago. It also beckons history buffs with the National Museum of Korea and the War Memorial of Korea. Today, it is easy to spot young, vibrant K-pop fans near Sinyongsan Station, where the headquarters of Hybe, the K-pop powerhouse behind BTS, are located. Meanwhile, “Yongnidan-gil,” a cluster of streets between Samgakji Station and Sinyongsan Station, is a hot spot among Koreans wanting to take Instagrammable photos and spend quality time with their friends. But, for those who feel exploring these sites is not enough, a five to six-minute walk from Yongsan-gu’s iconic shopping complex, HDC IPark Mall, takes you to Baekbin Railroad Crossing where you can experience a uniquely retro vibe. This railroad crossing was heavily featured in the mega-hit drama series “My Mister” (2018). The two lead characters -- a senior supervisor of a company Park Dong-hoon (played by the late Lee Sun-kyun) and his teammate Lee Ji-ahn (played by IU) -- who lived in same neighborhood, often ran into each other there on their commute to work. Though Baekbin Railroad Crossing, surrounded by old-fashioned shops, low-rise buildings and houses, is an interesting place during the day, its true charms are revealed once the sun sets. At night, red traffic lights, flashy head lamps and LED signs light up the narrow alleys. As one of the few remaining railroad crossings in Seoul, even some of its smallest details, from the crossbuck to the barriers and alarm bell attached to a mast, catch the eyes of drama fans and travelers alike. This crossing road is also known as “Ttaeng Ttaeng Street,” after the sound of the train bell. “I really find this railroad crossing special, because you can easily feel the retro vibe in central Seoul. The contrast between the skyscrapers and the nearby old-fashioned houses seems interesting to me. It is certainly a cool place to take some memorable photos,” a 25-year-old university student surnamed Park told The Korea Herald on Tuesday. While taking a light stroll around the area, visitors can see office workers having their “hoesik,” or after-work get-together, in the nearby restaurants just like the characters in “My Mister.” If you wish to enjoy Jeju’s renowned black pork cuts, head over to Childonga for dinner. You can also try some unique “hansik,” or Korean cuisine, like beef tartare bibimbap at JipJip. If you are not a big fan of a gastronomic journey, head over to the IPark Mall’s colorful outdoor plaza or RM Forest No. 2 at the nearby Han River Park before calling it a day.

""I am not sasaeng. I am just a genuine fan who really loves NCT,"" said an 18-year-old girl who wished to remain anonymous. She claims that all her actions are out of sincere support and love -- taking taxis to follow her favorite singer as he goes about his day and waiting for hours at the airport to take photos of the group, to name but a few. She admits that she even knows where the celebrities live. ""Sometimes I spend about 300,000 won ($217) on taxis to follow NCT's schedule. They even talk to me in person sometimes!"" That ""talk"" involved members telling her to go home now. Call for end to harassment Despite the growing awareness of the need to respect artists' privacy, the excessive actions of some individuals continue to torment celebrities who call for relief from constant harassment by ""sasaeng."" “Sasaeng” is a term used to describe fans who invade artists’ privacy, often exhibiting aggressive and obsessive behaviors. After months of harassment by sasaeng, Renjun of NCT said on the fan communication platform on April 11, ""Sasaengs are nothing but scary stalkers to me. They follow me, sit next to me on planes, and take photos of me while I sleep. It's a huge burden for me,"" Later that month, Renjun announced he would take a break from work citing health reasons. He continued to be hounded by phone calls from sasaeng and, in June, he took action by posting what he thought was a phone number of sasaeng on a fan communication platform. It turned out that the number belonged to a non-fan. When the incident caused an uproar, Renjun posted an apology on social media. Haechan, another member of NCT, has also suffered from sasaeng harassment. In November last year, a sasaeng walked into Haechan’s home, where he lives with his family. The methods used by sasaeng to reach celebrities have become increasingly cunning. Some make calls by manipulating phone numbers and pretending to be fellow K-pop group members. Techniques commonly used in voice phishing scams are now being employed by sasaeng. Some even call during live broadcasts to verify if the number they have is the celebrity's. Some sasaeng use K-pop stars' frequent international travels as additional opportunities to follow them. “On a return flight to Seoul after a fan signing event, we found that someone had already pre-booked and changed the in-flight meals for the members' seats,” said TXT’s Taehyun through the fan communication platform Weverse on June 29, adding suspicion that it might have been the act of sasaeng. Asked about the allegations that sasaeng fans had changed in-flight meal orders, a Korean Air official said, “To change in-flight meal reservation information, one would need the ticket reservation number and the phone number associated with the reservation record. Whether it was a sasaeng's work needs to be confirmed."" The official, however, did confirm that actions by sasaeng fans have caused inconvenience on multiple occasions. “Sasaeng fans have repeatedly bought tickets just to follow stars into the area past the immigration only to cancel the tickets right before the flight, demanding refunds. We have had to implement cancellation fees. These fees are not solely due to sasaeng issues, but they have certainly been a factor,” the official said. An Asiana Airlines official also said the company instituted penalty rules for ticket cancellations made just before boarding due to troubles with sasaeng. Some stars have resorted to drastic measures to avoid sasaeng harassment when traveling. During a Naver V Live broadcast in 2019, BTS’s V also revealed that BTS uses private flights due to sasaeng issues. ""We would like to fly on regular flights, but some people figure out our flight schedule and sit next to us. It's very uncomfortable because we can't relax in our private space. It scares me a lot and I wish it would stop,"" he said. The problem of saesaeng harassment persists despite entertainment agencies' efforts -- ranging from warnings to legal actions -- to protect their artists. Edam Entertainment, singer IU's agency, claiming severe privacy violations at airport security zones, duty-free shops, aboard flights and at hotels, issued a press statement on June 18, which said, ""Please refrain from attempting conversations, taking photos, giving gifts, or filming the artist onboard."" K-pop powerhouse, SM Entertainment, announced on March 6 that it would take legal action on sasaeng harassment of NCT members. But warning appears to have had little impact given the continued harassment experienced by Renjun. Hybe, which established a task force in 2023 to tackle the illegal trading of stars' flight information, recently reported that they had identified social media accounts trading artists' flight information. They have secured evidence to identify these individuals and submitted it to the police. The police, for their part, are reported to have conducted long-term investigations both domestically and internationally and some cases have been sent to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office. The illegally traded information was used to obtain seat information to board the same flight and attempt close contact with the celebrities. Flocks of fans following idol members are a common occurrence but dangerous situations often dp arise. On June 16, fans who gathered at Incheon International Airport to see the boy group Riize returning from an overseas event broke an automatic door when things became disorderly. Photos taken in such situations often become commodities. Fans who cannot attend events sometimes hire others to get photos or purchase photos. Posts selling photos taken at airports or other events are easy to find on social media platform X. Photos of stars are not the only thing for sale on the Internet. It is not difficult to find posts offering to sell information about K-pop singers, including their homes, personalities, phone numbers, relationship status and even details like their exes. ""I can't exactly count the number of purchase requests, but I do make some money out of it,"" said an anonymous X user who posted about selling celebrities' private information. ""I don't worry about the agency's warning. They don't take serious actions on sasaeng or people who provide information on artists,"" added the user. Kwak Keum-joo, a professor of psychology at Seoul National University, explained that obsession with celebrities is often accompanied by fantasies about the object of affection. “Having affection for someone is natural, but if that affection becomes excessive and especially if the person is not someone you interact with in your daily life, one may create a distorted fantasy about the person and become obsessed with it,” Kwak said. Kwak further explained that sasaeng fans' actions are a form of self-defense. “Some overly obsessive fans cannot tolerate any deviation from the image they have created in their minds. They continue their excessive behavior to maintain their affection and fantasy.” Kwak also noted that the diffusion of responsibility in crowd psychology encourages excessive actions among sasaeng fans. “When acting in a group, people become more aggressive and are less likely to recognize the wrongfulness of their actions. They mistakenly believe they have no responsibility for their actions as more people are acting just like them.” “It is a shame that sasaeng problem continues to persist, but celebrities must maintain their fandom to survive, so this issue is likely to persist,” Professor Kwak added.",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU's agency, Edam Entertainment, in the context of addressing sasaeng fans and privacy violations, but IU herself is not directly discussed. The focus is on the broader issue of obsessive fans in K-pop, which is relevant to her as a female singer, songwriter, and actress, but the article does not center on her specifically or her work.

The K-pop duo was welcomed by 10,500 people in the audience holding green fan lights that shined like fireflies glowing on summer evenings. Sunday’s show was the last day of AKMU’s two-day 10th-anniversary concert “10VE” at the Kspo Dome in Seoul. With musical actors taking part in AKMU’s performances adding more emotion and liveliness to the stage, the concert felt like a musical. “I didn’t want you to come to our concert to just listen to us sing. Instead, I wanted our concert to be like a picnic that you can enjoy peacefully and go back home filled with love,” said Lee Chan-hyuk of AKMU. Chan-hyuk had a solo stage performing “Bench” during which he had a chance to show off his dancing skills. Lee Su-hyun of AKMU then performed “Re-bye” alone holding a feather fan. She added some acting and altered the song to make it jazzier. In the setlist of 21 songs, AKMU included many tracks from its debut album “Play” released in 2014. “We wanted to take you guys back 10 years. Our concept for the debut album was fairies living in a forest. That is why the set is a scene from a fairytale,” said Su-hyun. Su-hyun then sat down in front of a piano and Chan-hyuk took out his acoustic guitar. “We used to play like this when we were young living in Mongolia,” Su-hyun told her brother. The siblings then dazzled the audience singing “Time and Fallen Leaves” and “How can I love the heartbreak, you’re the one I love” while playing their instruments. For the second part of the show, AKMU appeared inside a cave under the green hill. “Hi, we are the acoustic duo AKMU,” said AKMU, just like how they introduced themselves when starring on SBS’ audition show “K-pop Star Season 2"" in 2012. The duo performed a medley of singles “Crescendo,” “On the Subway,” “The Love of Foreigner” and “Little Star.” Near the show's end, K-pop soloist IU made a surprise appearance as a guest performer. “It’s an honor to be invited to AKMU’s 10th anniversary concert. I was their guest performer for their first-ever standalone concert as well, so this is very meaningful. I want to congratulate them for becoming one of the best South Korean musicians,” said IU. IU performed “The Meaning Of You” and “Blueming.” Su-hyun also performed an unreleased song “Remember” for the first time on stage. “This is a song that I made thinking about my younger self. I am happy I get to sing this song in front of you guys,” said Su-hyun. The song is about a girl chasing her dreams and the older Su-hyun telling her younger self that she has the right to be happy. The concert reached its climax when AKMU performed “Green Window” and “200%.” “This will be an unforgettable concert for us. Through this concert, we wanted to look back on our lives which had their ups and downs. The last song reminisces on our childhood,” said Chan-hyuk. AKMU wrapped up the concert with “Will Last Forever.”",iu,4.0,"The article specifically mentions IU as a guest performer at AKMU's concert, aligning with her work as a singer.

Korea to crack down on ticket scalping via macro tools,2024-03-18,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/03/18/20240318050521_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"The South Korean government said Monday that the recent law revision banning the use of macro tools to buy tickets will take effect Friday as part of its measures to fight widespread ticket scalping in the country. The revision of the Public Performance Act specifies that no one shall illegally buy tickets for performances by using computer programing tools for automated repetitive inputs -- the macro programs -- for the purpose of reselling them, according to the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism. Those guilty of violation could be subject to up to one year in prison or a 10 million won ($7,500) fine. ""Ticket scalping threatens the basis of the market order for our culture and sports, and we (the ministry) will take severe actions against it. ... The Culture Ministry will implement various policies that can root out and prevent ticket scalping, thus restoring the order in the distribution system of culture and sports fields,"" the Culture Ministry Yu In-chon said. Since March 2, the ministry has been operating a webpage exclusively devoted to reports related to illegal ticket sales (www.culture.go.kr/singo), which allows users to report such acts online or via phone while providing options to apply for legal consultation. It plans to work closely with the cybercrime division of the National Police Agency to crack down on the ticket scalping. The ministry also plans to hold continued meetings with those in the fields of culture and sports to discuss countermeasures against illegal ticket sales, starting with a meeting Monday at the National Theater of Korea with officials from major theaters and performance agencies across the country. Ticket scalping in South Korea has been an ongoing problem -- especially in the era of digital ticketing -- with the damages from the illegal act said to be substantial. In an interview with The Korea Herald last year, Yoon Dong-hwan, the chair of the Record Label Industry Association of Korea, said that more than 50 percent of the tickets from sold-out performances typically go to scalpers. Yoon's claim is not backed up by an official tally, but statistics do make it clear that ticket scalping in the country is on the rise. According to the Korea Creative Content Agency, the number of reports related to illegal ticket sales went from 359 in 2020 to 4,224 in 2022. A survey by the RLIAK in 2023 showed that 32.8 percent of those aged between 19 and 29 have bought a ticket from a scalper at least once, followed by 25 percent of those in their 30s and 40s. Singers across the country have been attempting to fight such illegal actions in various ways. K-pop megastar IU slaps a life-time ban from her fan club on anyone caught illegally selling a ticket to her concert, and singer Jang Beom-jun implemented a system of selling tickets as non-fungible tokens for last months' performance. Many others have a no-warning policy for canceling tickets suspected of being reserved by a ticket scalper. The revision of the performance law follows complaints that ticket scalping via bots had remained in a legal blind spot since legal punishment for such acts had only been stipulated in a law introduced half a century ago. Prior to the revision, illegal sales of tickets were only punishable by the Article 3 of the Punishment for Minor Offense Act, which does not address online sales.",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU as an example of a singer taking action against ticket scalping, but the main focus is on South Korea's broader crackdown on scalping using macro tools.

IU charmed the nearly 14,000-strong audience during the first ""hypnotic"" part of the show. Then, a little girl wearing a white dress and holding a lantern appeared on stage as it filled with fog. The girl wandered around, lost in the woods until a golden path appeared in front of her, at the end of which stood IU. IU proceeded to perform “Celebrity” which seemed to tell the little girl, who symbolized the singer's listeners, that even though she feels lost at the moment, she will soon find her way to achieve her dream. “Now, I’m going to sing ‘Blueming’ for which I want you to put down your cameras and phones, and focus on this moment with me,” IU asked her fans. The singer's fans sang along with the artists, almost as if they had practiced it beforehand. “The next song is ‘I stan U,’ and I wrote this song thinking about you guys. I wanted to tell you that just as you cheer for me on stage, I also hope to be that kind of audience for you,” the artist said, expressing her affection toward her fans. “I also have this special fan light designed just for me. Don’t forget that, whenever life is harsh to you, IU is cheering for you with this fan light.” During the last of her four concerts at the KSPO Dome in Seoul, actor Park Bo-geum was invited to the stage as a guest performer. “He is a dear friend of mine who is not a singer but sings just as well as a singer and is unbelievably handsome,” said IU as she introduced Park to her fans. IU became friends with the actor while shooting the Netflix series “When Life Gives You Tangerines” last year. Park performed IU’s “Not Spring, Love, or Cherry Blossoms” and Jukjae’s “Let’s Go See the Stars.” Guest artists at the singer's first three concerts were NewJeans, Riize and Le Sserafim. IU transformed the mood by performing her ballad “Through the Night,” immersing her fans in a mellow and cozy atmosphere. “I think this song will be included in all of the set lists for my future concerts. That’s how much I love this song and it’s so soothing when we sing it together. I hope this moment comes to your mind before you go to sleep,” said the artist. The concert hit its climax when IU performed “Shopper,” the lead track of her latest EP, “The Winning.” The sound of the audience singing along to the artist was deafening. Tweety Bird, the famous yellow canary character from the animated cartoon, “Looney Tunes,” with whom IU collaborated to promote her new album, appeared on the screens around IU, making it seem as if the character was performing on stage alongside the singer.

Instead, through her sixth EP, ""The Winning,"" the artist shares her own definition of “winning,” which she says is accepting the fact that not everyone blooms into a flower. The new EP was released Tuesday. On the day of her new album release, IU posted a video on her official YouTube channel in which, sitting down on a couch, she introduces her album as if talking to a friend. “I decided to live as a spore. I was inspired by the word 'spore' when making this album,” said IU. ""Holssi"" is spore in Korean, and also the title for one of the two lead tracks in her new album. “When I was young, I thought I would bloom into a flower. But now that I’m 30 years old, I rather accept the fact that I could live as a spore, but do my best to live an awesome life as a spore. I continuously asked myself what is a successful life for a spore in this album,” the artist explained. “Shopper,” the other lead track on the album, is about dreaming big even when the goal seems impossible. “(Through this track) I wanted to tell people to aspire (for their dreams) with confidence.

Singer Jang Beom-jun recently announced that the ticket sales for his concert next month will be using the blockchain system, with the tickets being sold as non-fungible tokens that cannot be sold to anyone but the initial buyer. Jang had sold out the concert scheduled for this month, but cancelled all reservations due to ticket scalping. Prior to her year-end concert last year, K-pop megastar IU implemented a system where a person illegally selling a ticket would be banned for life from her fan club, and the person who reported such activity would get the ticket instead. Sung Si-kyung, who held his year-end concert on Dec. 29-31, sold many of his tickets on-site, ensuring that each person buys one ticket only. He took to Instagram to urge fans not to buy tickets illegally, saying it would lead to cancellation and more tickets being available for sale on-site.

The group suspects that about half of the tickets for sold-out performances go to ticket scalpers. South Korea recently revised the Public Performance Act to specify that buying tickets with targeted software -- or macros -- is illegal.

The hashtag has since been used to commemorate the victory of marriage equality. “If there is a word that is exactly the opposite to the message of the single, it would be ‘hatred.’ We sincerely hope that all love will win in a world without hate, and that the meaning of this song will be conveyed without hurting anyone,” the agency added. “Love Wins All,” set for release on Jan. 24, is a much-anticipated single featuring V of BTS.

Ticket scalpers are one of the biggest headaches for the Korean music industry, including musicals and classical music. Although scalpers have always been an issue, the problem has grown in size and scope, and ticket scalping has turned into a lucrative business. ""More than 50 percent of the tickets for sold-out performances typically go to scalpers. Sometimes they take up more than 70 percent of the seats,"" said Yoon Dong-hwan, the chairman of the Record Label Industry Association of Korea, who recently filed a petition for an amendment of the law to confront the ticket scalping problem.

Macros are automatic systems that can go through the multiple steps of purchasing a ticket in seconds. Ordinary consumers without such a program cannot compete with the speed of macro. Scalpers make a profit by selling tickets to fans who are willing to pay an extra fee through resale sites or social media. On Ticket Bay, one of the most well-known reselling platforms, tickets for a popular boy group The Boyz concert were trading at up to 7,000,000 won ($5,410) as of last Thursday, while VIP seats for one of the best-loved ballad singers Sung Si-kyung's concert were trading at up to 1,199,900 won. The original price of each ticket is about 150,000 won. Scalpers have come up with ingenious ways to avoid crackdowns. To pass the identification check, the sellers claim the tickets in person at the ticket booth and hand them over to the buyers just before entering the performance venue. Some scalpers cancel their tickets at a prearranged time, allowing buyers to rebook them quickly and safely enter the concert venue with the ticket reserved under their name. Others attract buyers before tickets open, advertising ticket proxy purchase services using macros. Yoon pointed out that ticket resale has now become an industry, organized and systematized. From people who buy tickets running macros to people who sell tickets on social media or secondhand trading sites and people who meet buyers and deliver tickets in person, there is a division of labor. Most of the accounts used by scalpers on ticket sales platforms are purchased from third parties that are not related to the scalpers. While resellers continue to evolve, the legal system has not kept up with the changes. Under the current law, illegal ticket transactions refer only to transactions made in specific places, such as stadiums and performance venues. Online transactions, which account for the absolute majority of ticket resales, are not subject to punishment. As criticisms mount, some singers and entertainment agencies have taken matters into their own hands. Singer IU has introduced a system that gives tickets to people who report inappropriate transactions while Sung Si-kyung caught a scalper with his manager posing as a buyer. However, such attempts only filter out very few cases. Discussions on preventing scalping have spread to the political arena. At a parliamentary audit last month, Rep. Ryu Ho-jeong of the minor progressive Justice Party called on the Korea Creative Content Agency to actively operate an anti-scalping center. According to the KCCA data that Rep. Ryu submitted, the number of ticket scalping reports increased sharply after COVID-19 pandemic, from 359 in 2020 to 785 in 2021 and 4,224 in 2022. On Nov. 25, the Ministry of Justice converted the Record Label Industry Association of Korea's petition for an amendment of the scalping law to an open petition, starting the 30-day discussion period when public opinions are gathered. The result of the discussion will be announced within 90 days of the discussion period. The petition urged a speedy revision to the anti-scalping law, stressing that the law has never been revised since it was enacted some 50 years ago. “The law revision will provide the legal grounds for cracking down scalpers and expanding social discussion on the inappropriate ticket resale industry overall,” said Yoo.",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU briefly as an example of an artist taking action against ticket scalping, which is relevant to her role as a singer.

But Yim didn't actually record the cover, an AI program generated the song that sounds like Yim singing it. Some of Yim's fans were surprised by how accurate artificial intelligence was able to mimic the singer's voice, down to the exact way he breathes, pauses and sighs. ""It was something that I hadn't expected before. I very much enjoyed it,"" said Hwang Chan-hui, 29, speaking of Yim's AI version of ""Hype Boy"" on YouTube. “Of course, I know NewJeans is amazing, but my favorite (singer) is Yim Jae-beom. His husky voice drives me crazy. I’ve wished that Yim would release more diverse albums but he didn’t, which makes me a little sad."" AI-generated music has gained immense popularity in South Korea on platforms like YouTube and Instagram. Hundreds of creators are using the technology to re-create existing tracks with other artists' voices. The more unexpected the combination, the more interest it garners. However, this trend often involves the unauthorized use of an artist's voice and music. While AI-generated music creators argue that their work should be viewed as a form of artistic expression apart from business considerations, some creators are reaping benefits -- albeit not directly from their AI works. Spot-AI-fy, a YouTube channel that specializes in AI-generated music, carries a total of 235 video clips on the platform. Launched in May 13, the videos have recorded over 17.3 million views as of Sunday. The videos on the channel are AI songs created by Sorisori, an AI-based music generation service, featuring the likes of what sounds like Ariana Grande singing a Korean song to an AI cover of IU singing ""Cupid"" by Fifty Fifty. For the monthly subscription fee of 14,800 won, or $9.99 on the English website, subscribers can generate up to 200 tracks of music using AI. There are growing voices that AI music creators should not be eligible to claim credit or copyright to their work because they do not hold rights to the original voices or tracks. The copyright laws in Korea do not specifically cover AI music, although there are protections for the rights and freedom of the original artist. The Korea Music Copyright Association, a nonprofit organization administering public performance, broadcasting and reproduction rights on behalf of copyright holders, is concerned about AI-generated music, arguing that the phenomenon poses challenges to the existing copyright norms. ""Currently, it's difficult to respond to the copyright infringement of generative AI because it's hard to distinguish the original sources used by the generative AI from the final product. Also, there is no legal requirement to declare whether generative AI was used,"" said a KMCA official in an email to The Korea Herald, while highlighting the need to safeguard the interests of artists and the music industry. Legal experts also warned of possible copyright violations by AI-generated music. Beom Yu-kyung, a lawyer at Duksu Law Offices, emphasized the need to establish a system that makes clear the copyright of the original data used for AI training. “When it comes to the original reference of the background data, AI-generated music creators cannot avoid criticism. The current AI technologies aren't yet able to generate authentic products on their own. They still require external data, which is the point where a copyright infringement occurs,"" Beom told The Korea Herald by phone. ""In this regard, a system to certify the original source and to mandate obtaining consent from the copyright holder for the use of their properties is necessary to prevent potential copyright violations."" In May, Democratic Party of Korea lawmaker Lee Sang-heon, who chairs the parliamentary committee on culture, sports and tourism, submitted a proposal to amend the Contents Industry Promotion Act. The proposed amendment by Rep. Lee and nine other lawmakers, calls for a new provision to mandate specifying whether generative AI was used while making content. The proposal is awaiting review by the National Assembly. Lee also brought up concerns over AI-generated music during the National Assembly audit of the Culture Ministry on Oct. 10. Lee asked Culture Minister Yoo In-chon to support the proposed amendment if it passes the Assembly, playing an AI-generated rendition of Kim Kwang-seok's ""Around Thirty,"" featuring Yoo's voice. Yoo agreed on the urgency of the matter. The Culture Ministry has introduced a draft proposal of regulations and guidelines for AI utilization in creative works.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3236667,New fad uncovers old school transcripts for dose of nostalgia,2023-10-17,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/10/17/20231017000668_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Experts suggest economic, social hardships may lead young people to look to past Issuing and sharing one’s old school transcripts is a new social media fad in South Korea, as the retro craze continues among younger generations. According to the Ministry of Education, 2.85 million school transcripts were issued between July and September of this year, marking a 6.1-fold increase compared to the same period last year. While requests for transcripts are typically made for practical purposes such as job or college applications, this sudden surge is primarily attributed to a different motivation: a curiosity to rediscover one’s own past through the old school records. School transcripts in South Korea have a section where the homeroom teacher leaves a short comment about each student. This offers a hint of how a particular child was perceived by teachers as a student, and unique insight into one’s childhood. Childhood records, a few clicks away The rise of this trend was facilitated by the convenience of online transcript issuance. With just a few clicks at Government24, a civil service portal, anyone who graduated from high school here since 2003 can have their records issued online. Those who went to school before that must visit the school itself or regional education or administrative offices to request physical issuance of their transcripts. School records are preserved for 50 years. This reporter’s school transcripts show that teachers saw me as being “polite,” that I “read a lot of books” and as “fluent in English.” Apart from English proficiency, these attributes are among the most frequently used descriptions in teachers' comments. But some transcripts for celebrities have noted discernible characteristics, which perhaps indicate they possessed unusual qualities from an early age. For example, the sixth grade teacher of K-pop icon IU wrote that she was kind and “well aware of the physical and psychological changes that boys and girls in puberty go through,” of all things. Actor and singer Bae Suzy was praised by her middle school teachers as someone who “excelled in singing,” and that her efforts and talents made for bright prospects for her ambitions. Earlier this month, another K-pop star, Hyeri, joined the fad by sharing on YouTube the content in her school transcripts. The records showed that her childhood dreams in middle school went from being a doctor to a teacher and again to a flight attendant, but her self-introduced talent and hobby was dancing throughout all three years. “It's been 10 years since I've looked at the transcript. ... It's really amazing that a person's characteristics are reflected in such young days,” she said in the video. Looking up one’s school transcript is only among the latest of the retro-themed fads that has fascinated the country in recent years. Retro recent past While the retro craze has been ongoing for a while, 28-year-old Park Yu-ri recently got into it when items and content from her own childhood, specifically the 2000s, emerged in mainstream media. “(As for) the previous (retro) content (from the 1980s and 1990s), I followed them for fun, but I never really got to be nostalgic over it. But now things that were popular when I was little -- the clothing, the hair, the songs -- are back in style, which reminds me of when I was young.” Like Park, many younger Koreans in their 20s and early 30s are fueling the revival of fashion, culture and accessories from the turn of the 21st century, commonly referred to here as Y2K, referring to the year 2000. Fond memories of the early 2000s are also at the heart of the nostalgic trend. Among her favorite retro content is the “Hwang Eun-jeong” series on YouTube channel Beautyfool, depicting the school days of a 15-year-old girl in the 2000s -- which overlaps with Park’s own childhood. The channel has garnered over 760,000 subscribers in less than two years of existence. Another popular YouTube series is “05 Is Back,” from Psick University, which includes videos based on funny situations by those obsessed with trends and the fashion of 2005. It remains among the best-known content of the channel, inducing SBS’ popular variety show ""Running Man"" to parody it. Local scholars say that the challenging reality faced by young people in South Korea today is driving their desire to look back, rather than toward the future. Jo Yeon-ju, a clinical psychologist at Taean-gun Health Medical, said an economic slump can play a part in retrospective nostalgia. “Under crisis, people tend to seek a sanctuary to soothe their troubled minds. In times of economic hardship, they tend to miss the times when they were full of hopes and dreams,” she said in a recent interview with local media. “It seems that the retro trend seems to reappear whenever the economic crisis looms.” Lim Myung-ho, a professor of psychology and psychotherapy at Dankook University, said the people consuming the retro content wish to feel “the sense of fulfillment and self-confidence through experiencing pleasant and fun things in one’s past.” “Many young people today feel anxiety over issues such as housing, jobs and marriage, leading them to reminisce over the past,” he said.",iu,3.0,"The article specifically mentions IU (아이유) in the context of her school transcript, highlighting a teacher's comment about her during her childhood.

Just this month, the internet was abuzz following news that a Malaysian lawyer was suing the organizer of K-pop band Blackpink's concerts in his county. Lawyer Nas Rahman bought two tickets for the band's Kuala Lumpur show from its ""Born Pink"" world tour. However, on the day of the concert, he discovered that one of the two seats he had paid for did not exist. Rahman had to sit and stand throughout the nearly two-hour show. Despite attempts to negotiate with the show's organizer, Live Nation and Go Live, for a refund and some compensation for his discomfort, he couldn't reach an agreement with the company and decided to sue them instead, seeking compensation of up to 1 million Malaysian ringgit ($218,000). Rahman's experience is not an isolated case, with similar complaints coming to light following the quartet's Singapore concert on May 13. After the night ended, fans shared their disappointing experience online, complaining that they could barely see the stage. A TikTok comment left by a fan who claimed to have bought a VIP ticket for 398 Singapore dollars ($295) read, ""This was my first time going to a concert and I saw nothing but their arms,"" while another wrote, ""(I) paid $300 to watch Blackpink from people's phones."" Tickets hit by pandemic inflation Complaints from fans also focus on the prices of the tickets themselves, with the hyper-inflated prices for gigs now becoming the norm for K-pop fans. Earlier this month, Thai media MRG Online reported the average price of K-pop concert tickets sold locally this year for around 5,270 baht ($156), up almost 18 percent from the average price of 4,470 baht in 2019 before the pandemic and up 60 percent from 2013. Outraged Thai fans had taken the issue to the Consumer Protection Agency. Fans of boy band Stray Kids raised the issue in October, claiming the tickets of the band's February concerts -- the highest priced at 8,500 baht -- were too expensive. The agency, however, said ticket prices are not in its control, explaining the price ""is set based on a consensus between sellers and consumers."" Higher ticket prices are an ongoing issue in South Korea as well. A ticket for Tomorrow X Together's March concert held at the KSPO Dome was 154,000 won ($117) for a regular seat and 198,000 won for a VIP seat. The team's first standalone concert held the previous year in Seoul had all seats sold at 132,000 won. Last year's most expensive K-pop concert in Korea was Blackpink's show held in October at the KSPO Dome, which sold tickets in packages with prices ranging from 154,000 won to 264,000 won. The group's 2018 gig held at the same venue was priced at 110,000 won per ticket. Fans complain that the labels are taking advantage of their support for the artists. The burden weighs on the consumers even more as the ticket purchase is only the first step of the concert spree. A light-stick -- a must-have item in order to fully enjoy the show these days -- adds 20,000 to 50,000 won to the ticket price. Fans say they are often forced to get a new one as the remotely-controlled item gets upgraded every now and then. Taking an old version, you might find yourself shaking a stick which flashes the wrong color at the wrong time. Bad behavior continues Despite bloated prices, fans still pay, becoming an easy target of ticket scalpers. Scalping has always existed in the world of concerts, but the phenomenon has grown in both scale and number, so much so that it is now coming under legal control. Taiwan recently passed a law to punish ticket scalpers. The amendment to the country's Development of the Cultural and Creative Industries Act was made after a ticket for Blackpink's Kaohsiung concert surged as high as 400,000 Taiwanese dollars ($13,000), nearly 45 times its original price. The amendment made it so that anyone who attempts to sell tickets at a price higher than face value would be slapped with a fine up to a maximum of 50 times the original fee, even stipulating a jail term of under three years and a fine of NT$3 million to be imposed on those caught snatching tickets illegally via automated programs. Some artists have taken matters into their own hands, with singer IU among those who have taken the strictest measure. For her ""Golden Hour"" concert held in Seoul last September, the singer's agency restricted all ticket trading outside of the official platform regardless of the profit gained. The company also received reports of scalping and yielded the collected ticket to the reporter, while permanently blacklisting perpetrators from official membership and future concerts. Dynamic pricing not a solution To tackle ticket scalping, more local labels are considering the so-called dynamic pricing system -- the latest hot topic issue among K-pop fans. Dynamic pricing enables ticket prices to fluctuate based on demand. While mostly used by the world's biggest live music company Live Nation's ticketing platform Ticketmaster, more local labels are also opting for it. Hybe recently announced its implementation, the first among the local labels, while Blackpink's UK shows last year were also sold on a dynamic pricing-basis. Hybe introduced the new pricing system with BTS' member Suga's US tour. A fan on Twitter said she paid $867 for a ticket, more than double its opening price of $350, while another claimed to have seen the price surge to nearly $1,000. Critics say firms should be more cautious in adopting the system in respect to the unique culture and environment of the K-pop industry. ""K-pop is essentially run by the fandom. Dynamic pricing benefits the company and artists by taking more from the fans, forcing fans to show their love for the artists by paying more,"" South Korean pop music critic Kim Heon-sik told The Korea Herald. Kim denounced Hybe's decision to introduce dynamic pricing, saying ""it's almost like a game of chicken."" ""Fans have to pay blind money for the ticket, and in doing so, competing with each other. The system forces them to turn their backs on other fans and eventually on their own artists,"" Kim added, stressing there must be a reasonable ceiling to cap the spike. Negative sentiments are already spreading fast among fans. While Tour Data on Thursday announced that Suga is the first rapper to earn over $3 million in a single arena-concert in US history, a fan said she feels ""on the fence"" about his achievement. ""Seeing as this was achieved through dynamic pricing, I have no doubt our Suga would have achieved this without the practice,"" the fan wrote on her Twitter, adding, ""It's sad that a lot of fans had to potentially go into debt to pay for this."" Using the system is their choice, but the price for it will be shared by the consumers and the whole industry, critics added. ""In K-pop, when one company starts something new, the rest tend to follow. So it's likely that dynamic pricing will become more common, but I'm worried it will harm the industry,"" Jung Min-jae, another Seoul-based pop music critic, said in a phone interview. Those who benefit will see profit, while others will be priced out eventually. ""Ticket prices have surged following the pandemic, and that in itself is already weighing on the artists. Many singers who held sold-out shows in the past aren't able to this year because of the spike in ticket prices. It's time that companies address the issue, (taking into account) what is good for the artists in the long term,"" Jung warned.",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU briefly as an example of an artist taking strict measures against ticket scalping, but the main focus is on broader issues in the K-pop concert industry (pricing, scalping, fan experiences).

""Based on comprehensive data that we collected from the media and the investigative authorities, the accuser is not making allegations of plagiarism against the songwriters, but solely IU,"" the statement read. It continued, saying, ""The fact that an unrelated third person sued only the vocalist, IU, even though some of the composers denied the allegations, shows that the person is only trying to damage the artist's (IU's) reputation."" Edam Entertainment had also issued an official statement on Wednesday following reports that IU was sued. Edam said then that it recently began a legal fight against people writing malicious comments and spreading false rumors about the artist online. ""While monitoring, we were astounded and shocked to discover that someone had filed a lawsuit for plagiarism,"" the agency said on Friday, adding, ""We will hold the accuser who filed this indiscriminate case accountable for the results."" In the complaint, the accuser asserted that six of IU's songs -- ""Boo"" (2009), ""Pitiful"" (2009), ""Growing Up,"" ""Good Day"" (2010), ""The Red Shoes"" (2013), ""Bbibbi"" (2018) and ""Celebrity"" (2021) -- are suspected of copying other songs.

In the case of ""Good Day"" and ""The Red Shoes,"" the complaint reportedly claimed that ""the resemblances are so significant that it can be discerned even by an ordinary person."" On Thursday, some of the songwriters of the six songs released statements denying the allegations. Producer Lee Min-su, who composed ""Good Day"" and ""The Red Shoes,"" wrote on his social media: ""I did not refer to, nor have in mind works by others when I made the songs."" ""The Red Shoes"" was previously accused of plagiarism in 2013 when German rock band Nektar claimed the song resembled its song ""Here's Us"" in some parts. Lee denied the accusation then, and other reputable local musicians, including Hybe founder Bang Si-hyuk and star composer Kim Hyeong-seok, stood up for him as well. Composer Lee Jong-hoon of ""Bbibbi"" also said through his social media on Thursday that he ""did not copy any other song,"" and went on to slam the accuser for choosing the wrong target to sue. ""Copyright violations should be referred to the songwriter and not the singer. If necessary, the suit should have been filed against me, the composer, in the first place,"" Lee said in his post. He also pointed out that plagiarism can only be punished at the victim's request. ""The complaint holds no legal force when filed by a third party.

Directly quoting the complaint, the report said, ""These songs are similar with the original songs in the melody, rhythm and the chord progression. And in the case of 'Good Day' and 'The Red Shoes,' the resemblances are so significant that it can be discerned even by an ordinary person."" The cited quote continued, stating, ""All six songs show signs of plagiarism in the introductory part, which plays a decisive role in forming a song's overall atmosphere and identity, as well as catching the listeners' attention to make them play the song."" Speaking to Maeil Business, the anonymous accuser claimed that IU remained silent on the issue despite the repeated allegations, and that the singer tried to delete the posts and content raising such issues based on copyright infringements. Edam said it has not been officially notified by the police about the reported claim. ""We only became aware that such a complaint had been filed through the news report. We have not yet seen what the complaint says and are still in the process of verifying it,"" the agency added. Meanwhile, ""Celebrity"" is the only song among the aforementioned six that IU took part in creating as a songwriter. ""The Read Shoes"" and ""Good Day"" were written solely by composer Lee Min-soo, ""Boo"" by Han Sang-won and ""Bbibbi"" by Lee Jong-hoon. The melody of ""Pitiful"" was co-written by Choi Gap-won and PJ, while ""Celebrity"" was composed mainly by producer Ryan Jhun.",iu,5.0,"The article specifically mentions IU (아이유) and focuses on her career as a singer-songwriter, addressing plagiarism allegations related to her music.

For one, it was director Lee Byeong-heon’s return after helming the country’s highest-grossing comedy, “Extreme Job” (2019). And the star-studded cast including Park Seo-joon and IU and approachable plot based on the real-life event 2012 World Homeless World cup added expectations for a strong comeback. The plot rolls along quickly for the first 20 minutes, showing how Hong-dae (Park), a hot-tempered former soccer player, ended up coaching a group of homeless men who have never played soccer before. But after a promising set-up, “Dream” fails to maintain its grip on the audience's attention for the rest of its 126 minutes. Like many other sports films, it falls into the trap of portraying the underdogs’ stories too dramatically. Lee told reporters during a press conference that this film was particularly difficult as it was a project from long ago. He was also keen to cover homelessness issues carefully. The film is being released eight years after it was conceived. ""I felt it was like a mission for me to resolve bias against (homeless people) and also felt like a homework to find the middle point to not to comically depict that part,” Lee said, adding that he is also curious about how the audience would view his new film. The so-called ""Lee Byeong-heon clique” -- Heo Joon-seok, Kim Jong-soo, Yang Hyun-min, Jung Seung-kil, Lee Hae-woon and Hong Wan-pyo -- does this pretty well. As with his previous hits “Extreme Job” and “Melo is My Nature,” Lee provides them with realistic lines and character buildup without exaggeration, and the actors make good use of the material, with naturalistic depictions of their characters. The trouble seems to start with the two lead actors, both working with Lee for the first time. Park struggles to show his usual flair, and IU is lumbered with a role that doesn't play to her strengths. “Dream” was shot before Hirokazu Kore-eda's award-winning “Broker,” so in a way, this is her first-ever film. Her transition to the silver screen was a natural one after successful TV roles in “My Mister” (2018) and “Hotel del Luna” (2019). But her role as a documentary producer Lee So-min, who follows Hong-dae’s team on its journey to the Homeless World Cup in Hungary, is a poor fit. It does not help that her presence is diminished toward the end of the film, when So-min could have become a more multi-dimensional character and added spice to what, by then, is a flagging storyline. “Dream” opens in theaters on April 26.",iu,4.0,"The article specifically mentions IU (아이유) and discusses her role in the film ""Dream,"" which aligns with her work as an actress.

The film tells the story of a Yoon Hong-dae (Park Seo-joon), a professional football player-turned-coach who is put on disciplinary probation after becoming involved in an unexpected incident and tasked with coaching the South Korean national soccer team for the Homeless World Cup. “There was not too much to think about in deciding to make Homeless World Cup into the film, specifically the year 2010 when the Korean team debuted in the competition, because the purpose of this event was very meaningful,” director Lee Byeong-heon told reporters during a press conference held in Megabox Seongsu in Seoul on Thursday. “The competition was created to break the social bias against vulnerable social groups such as alcohol abusers, and the film also contains that message, as well as joy as a comedy film.” He added that it took more than 10 years to finally bring the film to audiences. “When ‘Extreme Job’ became a hit, I felt relieved to finally be able to make this film (in terms of both investment and preparation),” said Lee. Park said to look and act like a professional soccer player, he worked on bulking up and went through intensive training sessions.

The program will be a one-year project divided into four different seasons, each hosted by different stars. The first season, “The Seasons-Jay Park’s Drive,” will be led by the Korean singer and rapper Jay Park. It is the first time for Jay Park to host a music program for a local broadcast service in his 15-year career as a musician. “I tried to freely engage in the program by asking impromptu questions to our guests so I really enjoyed shooting the first episode. I think this program will be precious for many viewers as they don’t really get the chance to see shows in which musicians get to talk about their pieces in a comfy environment, because these days there are mostly competition and survival music programs,” said Jay Park at a press conference in Seoul on Tuesday. “At first, we thought we were doomed because we took a lot of time writing the script for the first episode of the show, but Jay Park did not go according to the script. But later, we were grateful for having Jay Park hosting the show, because what we wanted to do was just that -- to break the norms. He showed what hosting is in this new generation,” commented producer Lee Chang-suh. The program will focus on introducing music from diverse scenes without prejudice, while shouting out rookie acts. “I want to have IU and NewJeans as guests in our show because they are outstanding musicians offering music that people of all ages can enjoy. In the hip-hop scene, I have this person I would really like to introduce. He is DUT2, an R&B singer born in 2001. His music is sophisticated and he does legit R&B. I want people to get to know him,” Jay Park pointed out. Producers will put effort into conducting in-depth interviews with musicians and creating a well-made stage, according to KBS. That includes forming a young band led by pianist and composer Jeong Dong-hwan of Melomance. “Every member in the band is both fun and talented, apt for doing trendy music. This experience was really valuable for me because I could solely concentrate in playing music,” said the band master. With Jay Park, the program is expected to highlight mostly K-pop and hip-hop musicians. “We have the next two hosts cast for the following seasons. There is the last season left for us to look for a host. We are currently working hard to cast this last person whom we would really like to have as the emcee of our show,” hinted producer Park Seok-hyoung.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2960344,[Herald Review] A promise for 14 more years: IU’s ‘Golden Hour’,2022-09-19,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/09/19/20220919000525_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"IU hosts a night of laughter, tears, awe in celebration of 14 years of music The orange sun hung low in the Seoul sky on Sunday evening, and as the clock ticked to 7 p.m., IU’s “Eight” began ringing out at Olympic Stadium in Jamsil, Seoul, marking the start of the second of her two days of “The Golden Hour: Under the Orange Sun” concerts. While all IU concerts are special, “The Golden Hour” was historic in another sense, as it marked her debut at Olympic Stadium, one of the nation’s biggest and most-coveted concert venues. The 30-year-old has done that as the first Korean female soloist. It also marked her first offline gig in three years, since “Love, Poem” in 2019. As the night opened with “Eight,” IU appeared on the stage clad head-to-toe in white. She performed “Celebrity” and danced around the stage, moving to the thrust platform that extended into the floor seats. “It’s full again tonight,” IU said, to which some 40,000 fans erupted in cheers. “It’s a little bit hotter than yesterday, but fortunately, the sky was prettier today. I wanted to sing ‘Eight’ with the sunset. It was something I had planned for a long time,” she said. ""I’m happy that it turned out as pretty as I expected."" IU then kicked into her classics with “dlwlrma,” “Every End of the Day” and “Friday.” During “The Meaning of You,” fans joined in, taking turns with IU. It was a night of celebration as Sunday marked the 14th anniversary of IU’s debut. On Sept. 18, 2008, IU began her career with her first EP, “Lost and Found.” With joys came sorrows, as the night bid a farewell to the much-loved “Palette” and “Good Day.” “I made this song when I was 25 and have sang it until now, cherishing it inside me. But I turned into my 30s (by Korean age), and I want to now leave the song to 25-year-old Jieun,” she said about “Palette,” adding the song will not be included in future official concert set lists. “Good Day” brought IU her first commercial breakout in 2010 and has continued to represent the singer for a long time, and she said she is now putting the song behind her to bring some fresher tunes into the rotation. Plenty of visual surprises, from fireworks to drone shows, were in store. During “Strawberry Moon,” IU appeared on a pink hot-air balloon shaped stage and traveled around the stadium, getting closer to the audience in the upper floors. After IU ramped up the night with, “Blueming,” “Hold My Hand” and “Last Night Story,” the night’s special guest, Jay Park, came to the stage. Along with the dance team Holy Bang, the rapper performed a duet of “Ganadara” with IU. “Although she’s much younger, IU is an artist I truly respect,” he said. “She’s stayed at the top for 14 years, pulling off everything perfectly, from her albums to acting and even the concerts, It’s more amazing for me as, as a fellow musician, I know how much hard work and effort it takes to do that.” IU toned down the mood and removed herself of the glistening glamour in the third part of the night. As she began crooning the lyrics of “Knees,” the hall dimmed. A roar of applause burst from the crowd after the song ended. She continued unrestrained, straight into “Winter Sleep.” “'Knees’ is a song that I think defines myself as a musician, and I wanted to sing the song on this stage even though it’s now so well known. ‘Winter Sleep,’ which followed, is a song that I wrote trying to find that emotions I’d felt when I had written ‘Knees.’ The two are like a set for me,” IU explained, adding it was her first time sharing her thoughts about the two songs. IU went on to softly coo “Night Letter” and “Only I Didn’t Know.” The night took a majestic turn with “Above the Time,” as a drone show began with the backdrop of roaring orchestral sounds. Drones flew up in unison into the night sky and made a silhouette of IU in “Celebrity.” They then moved around to draw an hourglass, the symbolic shape of “The Golden Hour.” Ending the official set list with her ""You & I,” IU was welcomed back to the stage by fans with “Love, Poem.” It was the first song of her encore, but fans gifted her with their own sing-along. “I will stand by your every step as we are perfect friends of 14 years,” read a placard held up by fans. Before wrapping up the night with “My Sea,” IU opened up about the uncertainties she had felt as she waited three years to finally hold the concert. “I really didn’t believe that this moment would come, but it has. I’ve spent the past two months worrying that some issue will come up and it might not happen, so it feels incredible that this moment has finally come,” IU said. It wasn’t just the pandemic that had troubled her. IU said she has been struggling with hearing issues as well. “It’s not something serious, but I haven’t been able to control my ear conditions for around a year now,” she began. “Near the end of yesterday’s show, my ears started to worsen in condition, and from last night until the rehearsal today, the past day has been like hell for me.” “I stepped onto the stage today not knowing what to do, but truly, you guys did everything for today’s show,” she said, thanking fans sincerely. Debuting as a girl at the age of 15, IU has grown into one of the most loved and respected artists over the past 14 years. What has brought her such big love, from listeners young and old, male and female, is not just her musical talents, but the humbleness that she has maintained. IU again moved many hearts with her words. “I thought that this show might be my final destination. I had never imagined being on such a big stage,” she said. “Through tonight’s memory, I will not become arrogant and, staying humble, I will keep on reminding myself about those hearts rooting for me. I’ve only come 14 years, so here’s to another 14 years.”",iu,5.0,"The article specifically mentions IU (아이유) and focuses on her concert celebrating 14 years in the music industry, highlighting her roles as a singer, songwriter, and actress.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2881960,‘Broker’ director Kore-eda aims to break prejudice against mothers who give up kids,2022-06-06,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/06/06/20220606000115_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda’s new film “Broker” does not hide the key question that the director wants to ask the audience: Should mothers take all the blame for abandoning their children in “baby boxes”? “At the beginning of the movie, Soo-jin (played by Bae Doo-na) says ‘if you are going to abandon a newborn, you should not have given a birth to him.’ This shows that there is a kind of prejudice toward mothers. The film starts from there,” the director said during an interview with a group of local reporters at a cafe in Samcheong-dong, central Seoul. “The film shows how much Soo-jin’s prejudice changed.” Kore-eda said he found out about the prejudice while talking with a man who grew up in an orphanage that had harbored some resentment toward his mother.  “He said he had contemplated the question: Did my mom want me to be born?” Kore-eda said. It was at that moment that it occurred to Kore-eda that the blame should not be solely on mothers, and that society should also share the responsibility. Kore-eda’s “Broker” centers on relationships formed through baby boxes installed at churches or institutions in Korea where desperate parents can leave their newborns anonymously. The fictional story begins with So-young (IU) leaving her baby in a box in front of a church. Sang-hyun (Song Kang-ho) and Dong-soo (Kang Dong-won) secretly steal the baby to sell him to a family who cannot legally adopt. So-young, who returns to the church the next day to retrieve the baby, finds out that Sang-hyun and Dong-soo have taken her child. Soon, So-young and the two men are looking for the right parents for the baby. Meanwhile, police officer Soo-jin is investigating the two men. The 60-year-old director said he heard negative feedback on some lines that were deemed “too direct” in conveying another underlying theme of cherishing life, such as a scene when So-young says, “Thank you for coming into this world,” to everyone in the room. But this was intentional, he emphasized. “I also strongly believed that my film should look at every human’s life positively,” he said. During the interview, the Japanese director also revealed how he created the framework of the new film. “I created this film with three boxes,” Kore-eda said. “The first box is the smallest one that the baby is being abandoned in, and then the second box is the van that brokers in the film travel in with the baby. The last box is symbolic and invisible -- the society that surrounds the baby.” Since Kore-eda cannot speak Korean, he noted that he got some help from veteran actor Song. Kore-eda highlighted that there was a particular moment when the star impressed him the most during this process. “Song Kang-ho suggested cutting out some of the lines that his character says. I tried cutting it out accordingly and it was indeed a whole lot better. But it is really rare for an actor to ask the director to cut out his own lines. In fact, it was the first time,” he said. “That was when I realized that Song Kang-ho is the actor that truly cares about creating a better film.” Kore-eda also shared his recent participation in the 75th Cannes Film Festival at which Song won the best actor award for his role in “Broker.” “It is the eighth time that I was invited to Cannes and every time it is different,” he said. “The most evident difference that I have noticed this time was that there were billboards for ‘Broker’ everywhere, which made me realize the power of CJ ENM. I was proud, but at the same time it was a lot of pressure seeing the poster of my work hung at the hotel I am staying at. I did take photos with it though,” Kore-eda said jokingly. When asked to talk about the decline of the Japanese film industry in the global standing, Kore-eda carefully said that he did not want to compare the current situation with the heyday of the Japanese film industry. “It is the same with the Italian and French film industries, there can be ups and downs, so I do not take it as a negative phenomenon,” Kore-eda said. “But it is true that the Japanese film industry is stagnant when looking at it from an outsider’s perspective. I know that there are a lot of talented actors and creators who are willing to do something fun. I think it is the old production environment that is making them difficult to take on challenges. There is not enough capital to develop something new so original works are rare. There are things that I learned while working in Korea and France. I learned what we have to work on, so I want to go back to Japan and make some improvements.” Kore-eda worked with French actors and staff for his previous project, “The Truth.”  “Broker” hits local theaters Wednesday.",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU (아이유) as an actress in the film ""Broker,"" which aligns with her occupation.

Only seven out of 21 movies (in competition) get awards. Before midnight, those seven films get a notice that they will receive awards. So I was really nervous before midnight,” Song said during the press conference held at CGV Yongsan in central Seoul. “It is hard to recall the exact moment when my name was announced. I think I panicked and had a bizarre feeling and also was very happy.” Song added that the first text messages he received after getting the award were from director Bong Joon-ho in London and director Kim Ji-hoon in Korea. “They were watching the awards ceremony on YouTube. I received so many congratulatory messages and so much praise. I want to continue to enjoy them bit by bit,” Song joked. Director Hirokazu Kore-eda also shared what it was like to watch Song receive the top actor prize. “I am a little cynical, so when people praise my work I think about which part was good and can never enjoy their praise. But when my actors receive praise, I can truly enjoy it and be happy,” the director said. “Japanese reporters also told me that I looked happier than usual.” The Japanese director added to the praises for Song’s performance. “I think Song won the award not because I did something right; it was due to the accumulation of all the work that he has done. I could not believe that he had not received any awards previously,” he said. “If he had received the award earlier for appearing in director Bong Joon-ho’s work or director Lee Chang-dong’s work, nobody would have thought that he did not deserve it. I feel sorry that he is receiving it (belatedly) with my project, and I am so happy. It is the best award that my movie ‘Broker’ can receive.” Kore-eda’s “Broker” centers on relationships formed through “baby boxes” installed at churches or institutions in Korea where desperate parents can leave their newborns anonymously. The film begins with So-young (played by IU) leaving her baby in front of a baby box at a church. Sang-hyun (played by Song) and Dong-soo (played by Kang Dong-won) secretly steal the baby to sell him to a family who cannot adopt legally. So-young who returns to the church the next day finds out that Sang-hyun and Dong-soo have taken her baby. Soon, So-young and the two men are looking for the rights parents for the baby. Meanwhile, a cop, Soo-jin (Bae Doo-na), follows the two men and nabs them as they are about to make an illegal deal with potential parents. During the conference, the Japanese director talked about what it was like to work with Korean actors. “I am sure actors had concerns since I do not speak Korean. In order to solve that problem, I tried communicating with them as much as possible. Before shooting the film, I gave them a hand-written letter. Once we started filming, we tried having a deep conversation. Also, Song Kang-ho gave me feedback after watching the roughly edited version each day,” the director said. The director also went on and talked about how Song inspired him to make the movie. “A scene of Song Kang-ho gently talking to a baby in the baby box and also selling babies came to my mind. I thought about Song playing a character that has both good and evil sides and that’s where I started from,” he said. He discovered about baby boxes while working on other projects. “When I was filming ‘Like Father, Like Son’ in Japan, I did a lot of different research about adoption and found out that there is a baby box in Kumamoto. Then I found out that there are baby boxes in Korea as well. According to statistics, the number of babies that are placed in baby boxes in Korea is over 10 times greater than the number in Japan.” He said. Korean heartthrob Kang talked in greater detail about his character and how he prepared for it during the press conference. “Dong-soo is from an orphanage and is also a partner of Sang-hyun who steals babies for adoption. Before filming the scenes, I had a conversation with people who used to live in orphanages. The most impressive thing for me was when they told me about how the children would get their hopes up when they heard a car come in, thinking that someone might be there to take them home. I thought that my character Dong-soo also waited for his mother like them,” he said. “Dong-soo is also a man who believes that children should grow up in a family and not at an orphanage. He also probably had some resentment (toward his mom). And realizes through So-young that his mother could have had reasons for not coming back to get him.” The singer-turned-actor IU, also known as Lee Ji-eun, talked about a difficult scene that she had to perform. “Since the director is Japanese, the script had swear words that did not seem natural for Koreans. So I asked if I could add some Korean swear words and the director allowed me to change it freely,” she said.” This is the first time I‘ve performed lines with swear words. So I practiced them a lot at home and was very nervous before filming.” “I always thought that Lee Ji-eun was a great actor but I did not know that she would pull off the scene so well,” Song said. “Another scene that I really liked was when they (Sang-hyun and Dong-soo) hop onto a van after failing to find the right parents. Sang-hyun and Dong-so do not know what to do in that scene and speak gibberish, and, just at that moment, she (IU) kicks the front seat. That was not in the script so I was really surprised and could perform a realistic reaction,” Song said.

Park Chan-wook won best director for “Decision to Leave” and Song Kang-ho won best actor for “Broker” at Cannes on Saturday. Some local film critics predicted that CJ ENM could sell as many tickets as it did pre-pandemic in 2019 with the two films. “Since I have not seen the film yet it is hard to predict, but ‘Broker’ has Song Kang-ho and many strong points as a commercial film so I expect to be successful (at the box office),” film critic Jung Ji-wook said. Culture critic Ha Jae-keun was a bit more cautious but believed the films would have a good start. “The recent trend has been that just because films won some awards at a big film festival, does not automatically mean the films can attract moviegoers. I think success will depend on actual moviegoers’ reviews,” Ha said. “But since the two films got a lot of attention from the media, it will help attract audiences in the beginning.” CJ ENM will release “Broker“ on June 8 and release “Decision to Leave” three weeks later, on June 29. So far, three films in which CJ ENM has invested and holds distributions rights to have won at the Cannes Film Festival, including Bong Joon-ho’s “Parasite,” which won the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 2019. “Parasite,” which was released after winning the Palme d’Or, sold 10.31 million tickets. Sales at CJ ENM’s film business increased by 63.8 percent to 349.3 billion won ($281.65 million) and its operating profit reached 43.6 billion won.  Meanwhile, the two films -- “Decision to Leave” and “Broker” -- have been performing well in the global film market. “Decision to Leave” has been sold to 192 countries, which is close to the record held by “Parasite,” which was sold to 205 countries. “Broker” has been sold to 171 countries. Park’s new movie centers on a polite and honest police officer named Hye-jun (Park Hye-il). Hye-jun looks into a suspicious death that occurred on a mountain and comes to suspect the dead man’s wife, the mysterious Seo-rae (Tang Wei). At the same time, Hye-jun becomes attracted to her. “Broker” features a cast of famous Korean actors, including Song, Bae Doo-na, Gang Dong-won and IU, and centers around the relationships formed through a “baby box,” a box installed at churches or institutions where desperate parents can leave their newborns anonymously.",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU as part of the cast of ""Broker,"" which aligns with her occupation as an actress.

South Korea took home two major titles -- Park Chan-wook won best director for “Decision to Leave” and Song Kang-ho won best actor for “Broker” – at the 75th Cannes Film Festival that ended Saturday. Park’s thriller-romance film, “Decision to Leave,” about a detective who comes across a widow who is a prime suspect in his murder investigation, stars Korean actor Park Hae-il and Chinese actor Tang Wei. In accepting his award, Park expressed gratitude to fans for going to theaters and looked forward to a bright future for cinema. “With the dreadful pandemic, there were times when we struggled due to the theaters closing down, but at the same time, we all realized how precious the existence of theaters had been to us. I am confident that we will keep safeguarding the cinemas in difficult times, like we have been through the pandemic,” Park said in Korean. This marks Park’s third win at Cannes. He won the Grand Prix in 2003 for the thriller “Oldboy” and the Jury Prize in 2009 for the horror film “Thirst.” Although “The Handmaiden” failed to win at Cannes in 2016, it went on to win the best film not in the English language at the British Academy Film Awards in 2018. No stranger to Cannes -- this was his seventh visit -- Song won his first-ever Cannes prize for playing an illegal baby broker in Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda’s heartwarming tale about a Korean family seeking home for an abandoned baby found in a “baby box.” The film is Kore-eda’s first all-Korean cast, all Korean-language film and also stars Gang Dong-won, Lee Ji-eun, also known as singer IU, and Bae Doo-na who starred in Kore-eda’s 2009 film, “Air Doll.” Meeting with reporters later, Park explained how his film differs from others in similar genres and with similar plots. “The first part ends and the second part unfolds in a new direction,” Park said. The woman who was pictured as a mysterious femme-fatale is no longer a subject of male gaze, but telling her own story, moves to the center of the story, Park explained. Song paid tribute to Kore-eda for his understanding of Korean culture, which made Song and other Korean actors comfortable throughout the shoot. “I have seen almost all of Kore-eda’s films so far. Not just myself, but many Korean fans love his films for the distinctive aesthetics of Japanese movies,” Song told reporters. The nine-member jury led by French actor Vincent Lindon gave the Palme d’Or to Swedish director Ruben Ostlund’s class warfare comedy “Triangle of Sadness.” This is the director’s second win of the top honor prize after “The Square” in 2017. Actor Zar Amir Ebrahimi was named best actress for her role as a journalist in Ali Abbasi’s “Holy Spider.” The jury prize went to “Le Otto Montagne” directed by Charlotte Vandermeersch and Felix van Groeningen, and “Eo” by Jerzy Skolimowski.

Just like every other press event with Korean reporters, the stars introduced their roles in the new film, shared their experiences from the set and posed for photos. However, there was one difference. Director Hirokazu Koreeda joined the event via video conference from Japan. There was also an interpreter for the director. The situation was similar to the press conference for “Vanishing” held in March. The film’s director Denis Dercourt could not be present at the event, and took part via video conference with an interpreter. One of the commonalities between the two films is that they are both directed by foreign directors and shot entirely in Korea with Korean staff and mostly Korean actors. Japanese director Koreeda’s highly anticipated film, which is competing at the Cannes Film Festival running through May 28, centers around the relationships formed through a “baby box,” a unique drop box installed at churches or institutions in Korea for desperate parents who wish to anonymously leave their babies. “Vanishing” depicts the story of Alice (played by Olga Kurylenko), a successful forensic scientist and a Korean police officer (Yoo Yeon-seok). While the two protagonists investigate a murder case in Korea together, they fall in love. Local culture critics suggest that more films like these are being made due to the surging global demand for Korean content. The global success of films like “Minari” (2020) and “Parasite” (2019) and actors like Youn Yuh-jung and Jung Ho-yeon highlight this trend.  “These global projects are being made because K-content — ones with a Korean-style storyline or Korean movie stars — are demonstrating potential in the global market,” said film critic Jung Ji-wook. He added that in the case of Koreeda’s film, producers worked with Koreeda not because he is Japanese, but because he is a world-renowned director who can work on projects on a global scale. Culture critic Kim Hern-sik shared a similar opinion. “I would say there is a shift from a localization strategy to globalization. For example, previously global projects were organized to enter a certain market -- to Vietnam, Japan and so on,” Kim said. “As the scale of Korean content grows, I think we have started targeting global audiences rather than audiences of a specific country. I think global projects have evolved in a way.” The critics also went on to explain how recent global projects are different from those from the past. “Earlier global projects did not work well. It was usually like this. If it was a project between Korea and Japan, it had a Korean man and a Japanese woman as protagonists. It focused on attracting audiences from both Korea and Japan, but ended up being neither a Japanese- nor Korean-style movie -- and failed,” Jung said. “And then there were Korean directors working overseas. They were not there as ‘Korean directors’ though. They were there because they are globally renowned directors like Park Chan-wook and Bong Joon-ho.” Both Jung and Kim view the recent changes as progress. “I see the changes as positive. Before, we only thought about global directors like Park Chan-wook working with European actors. Now it is different,” Kim said. Jung also predicts that there will be more cases of foreign directors working with Korean actors and staff.  “I am not saying that there will be an instant change, because these movies aim big -- they aim for the world market,” Jung said. “For instance, if we are only talking about the Korean market, when a certain type of movie is successful, then similar films flood the market. We’ve seen this happen,” she said. This is not the case with global projects, because they usually take more time to start, according to Jung. However, she said such projects will continue to be made.

During a press conference at CGV Yongsan in Seoul on Tuesday, the Japanese director said he got a lot of help from “Parasite” star Song Kang-ho while filming his movie, “Broker.” “Before shooting the film, I had a meeting with director Bong Joon-ho. We talked over a meal and he gave me suggestions on shooting a film in a foreign country. He said I must be nervous directing a movie in a foreign country, but once everything begins, all I have to do is believe in Song Kang-ho,” the director said. “He told me that Song Kang-ho is like a sun that will shine light everywhere on the filming site. After I worked with him, I realized that he (Bong) was right. Because of Song, I was able to finish the project without any problem.” Koreeda’s highly anticipated film centers around the relationships formed through a “baby box,” a drop box installed at churches or institutions for desperate parents to leave babies anonymously. It aims to prevent those parents from abandoning or even killing their newborns. Song plays Sang-hyun, a mysterious “broker” who finds new parents for the abandoned babies and makes special deals with them. Korean heartthrob Gang Dong-won plays Sang-hyun’s business partner. Bae Doo-na plays a police officer who is on Sang-hyun’s trail. Singer and actor IU plays a mother who travels with Sang-hyun to find parents for her baby.

The title was not ‘Broker’ at the time,” Song said. “I decided to take the role because I am his fan and I love his works. He is an artist that I respect, so I was honored.” The director also briefly talked about the movie being selected to premiere at the upcoming Cannes Film Festival. “No matter how many times I’ve been there, Cannes always makes me nervous. I am also excited to be there. I think it is the best place for the world premiere of ‘Broker’,” the director said. The 75th Cannes Film Festival will run from May 17-28. Meanwhile, at the beginning of the press event, Song stood up and talked about the late Korean actor Kang Soo-youn, who died from cerebral hemorrhage on Saturday at the age of 55. “We actors are grieving over the tragic news from a few days ago,” Song said. “On behalf of the whole ‘Broker’ team, I offer condolences to Kang Soo-youn.” “Broker” will hit local theaters on June 8.",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU (아이유) as part of the cast of the film ""Broker,"" aligning with her work as an actress.

After making history at the American Music Awards last month as the first Asian act to grab the top honor, BTS extended their winning streak, taking home all four main prizes of 2021 MAMA. The septet was named artist of the year, worldwide icon of the year, won album of the year with “BE” and song of the year with “Butter.” This is the third straight year that BTS has swept all four top honors at MAMA since 2019. The band also bagged best music video, best male group, best dance performance male, worldwide fans’ choice top10 and TikTok favorite moment. With the members on vacation, the group delivered their acceptance speech through a taped video message. “This year, we endeavored to make various musical attempts in order to create sound that could console and empower people who are enduring a hard time. We’re grateful that the music in which we poured our hearts is being enjoyed and empathized by others,” the group said, offering gratitude to their fans, Army. Hybe founder and Chairman Bang Si-hyuk, the mastermind behind the success of the group, was honored as best executive producer of the year. New artist of the year awards went to aespa and Enhypen. aespa, who was also named the best dance performance female group, said, “It’s our first time receiving an award in front of our fans. Rookie awards can only be won once after debut, and we’re thrilled to accept it in our fans’ presence.” Twice won the best female group title, Blackpink’s Rosé, the best dance performance solo, and Exo’s Baekhyun, the best male artist. IU scooped three trophies: best female artist, best vocal performance and best collaboration for her duet song “Nakka” with Akmu. This year’s edition of MAMA took place under the slogan “Make Some Noise,” to celebrate the return of audiences to the music scene in almost two years. K-pop diva Lee Hyo-ri went onstage as the first female host of the annual awards since MAMA’s launch in 2009. Lee teamed up with crew leaders of popular Mnet dance show “Street Woman Fighter” to decorate the night’s finale stage. A star-studded line-up of performers, including Tomorrow X Together, Itzy, NCT U, Enhypen, Ateez and Stray Kids, came together Saturday to put on a jam-packed show for the audiences. British singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran joined the show through pre-recorded footage, while 11-piece boy band Wanna One made a long-anticipated reunion on stage in two years.  MAMA also invited some of the biggest names in entertainment to present the awards, including stars Lee Jung-jae and Ha Sung-tae of the sensational Netflix series “Squid Game,” actor Song Joong-ki, singer-actor Rain and members of Girls’ Generation, Tiffany Young and Choi Soo-young. Organizer CJ ENM joined hands with Apple Music this year to incorporate the streaming platform’s data as part of the judging criteria and to allow the public to vote in categories such as worldwide fans’ choice top10 and worldwide icon of the year. Those making the fans’ top 10 list include Stray Kids, NCT Dream, NCT 127, Enhypen, TXT, BTS, Blackpink’s Lisa, Seventeen, Treasure and Twice.

According to industry sources Thursday, Blooming Moonlight, a game serviced in Korea by Chinese game developer Zishi Technology, showcases a character wearing a hanbok outfit with the exact same design as that of Baekoaksoo, a renowned Seoul-based hanbok company, which previously designed the outfits featured in the music video for BTS member Suga’s single “Daechwita,” released last year. Cho Jin-woo, chief executive of Baekoaksoo, expressed concerns, saying that it was more than just a simple case of intellectual property theft. “Hanbok is the national attire infused with the identity of the Korean people, and using it without permission is equivalent to stealing our unique spirit,” Cho said. “I hope the Chinese game company apologizes with utmost sincerity.” Aircap, a Korean game company which has exclusive rights to use Baekoaksoo’s hanbok design inside games, also denounced the Chinese game developer. According to Aircap, the stolen hanbok costume is one of the reward items given to users in the early stages of Girl Globe, the firm’s mobile dress up game. The Chinese developer copied the costume and simply changed the item’s name to “Lake Fog” from the original “Purple Scent.” “Every detail of the costume has been plagiarized, even the flowers actually used in the photo shoot (of Baekoaksoo),” Han Ji-min, chief executive of Aircap, said. “Though we asked the Chinese game company to make corrections, we haven’t heard back. If we don’t straighten this out, there will be another case like this. We will take actions based on legal consultations,” Han said. Recently, Chinese games have made several attempts to dress their characters in hanbok, which infuriated Korean users who see it as an attempt by China to steal Korea’s cultural heritage. In April, a Chinese mobile game Call Me an Emperor was embroiled in controversy for dressing a female character in a hanbok dress that was worn by Korean singer-songwriter and actress IU in the drama series “Moon Lovers.” Last November, Chinese gaming firm Paper Games’ Shining Nikki shut down its Korean server just two months after controversy erupted over clothing items featured in the game that resembled hanbok.",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU in the context of a Chinese game using a hanbok design similar to one she wore in a drama, which relates to her work as an actress.

The K-Culture Festival is the leading global festival connecting Korean culture with the world, further expanding Hallyu, or the Korean Wave. The two-day festival aims to encourage visitors to experience various aspects of Korean culture, including food, beauty, drama, fashion and K-pop.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2685650,"Impact of China’s crackdown on K-pop fandom limited as agencies diversify markets, business models",2021-09-08,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2021/09/08/20210908000782_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"China moves to restrict K-pop fans’ star-chasing activities, as shown in suspension of BTS fan account On Saturday, photos of a Jeju Air airplane featuring BTS’ Jimin on its exterior circulated on Weibo as part of a BTS fan club’s campaign to celebrate the K-pop star’s 26th birthday. K-pop fan clubs often celebrate the birthdays of their stars by buying advertisements in newspapers, on public transport or on subway billboards. But the photos sparked serious backlash in China, and Weibo banned the fan club-run social media account with over 1.1 million followers from posting for two months over what it called “illegal fundraising.” Weibo imposed the ban not only on the BTS fan club but also on other fan accounts devoted to well-known K-pop stars, including NCT, EXO, Blackpink and IU, pledging to stop “irrational star-chasing behavior.” The sudden clampdown on South Korean pop culture came after Chinese President Xi Jinping led a campaign to strengthen control over a range of sectors, including online gaming, private education and cultural content, including K-pop music. It was not the first time Chinese authorities put restrictions on the distribution of Korean content, but the latest move, given its scale and nature, appears worrying enough to prompt Korean media and brokerages to analyze the repercussions. Major Korean newspapers and TV stations reported Weibo’s ban on the K-pop fan accounts, saying the crackdown followed an announcement from the Chinese authorities last month about tougher measures to control the so-called “fandom culture.” Under the new guidelines, Chinese regulators are preventing youngsters from spending money to support their idols while banning online lists that rank celebrities’ popularity -- part of a drive to “clean up” fandom culture. A number of critical comments were posted on Korea’s major portal news sites criticizing China’s “excessive” control of the entertainment industry. “It is time for local entertainment agencies to forget about the Chinese market,” a user on Naver News said. Another user commented that the fan club operators should not be blamed as BTS fans were celebrating voluntarily. Impact on Korea’s entertainment industry  A Korean brokerage said in a report on Tuesday that China’s latest crackdown on Korean celebrities and fandom culture was unlikely to have a critical impact on the domestic K-pop industry in the long term. China has been keeping tight control of imports of Korean cultural content and other products ranging from cosmetics to water purifiers since 2016 over the deployment of the THAAD missile defense system. Mirae Asset Securities in Seoul said the related shares dropped by 9 percent from their recent highs, but the impact is likely to be limited, largely because Korean entertainment companies have already cut down on their dependence on and trust in the Chinese market, which is fraught with complex regulations. Since the beginning of this year, the four major entertainment agencies have witnessed a rise in share prices, following an uptrend in the broader market. In the year to date, shares of Hybe, the company behind BTS, rose 95 percent and S.M. Entertainment shares climbed 124.1 percent. During the same period, shares of YG Entertainment and JYP Entertainment went up 30.7 percent and 8.3 percent, respectively. “Profits of entertainment agencies are unlikely to be seriously affected by the Chinese clampdown on K-pop fandom,” said Jay Park, an analyst at Mirae Asset Securities. “The revenue of album sales in China account for 0.6 percent to 2.0 percent for Korea’s four major agencies.” The sharp rise of K-pop album sales outside of Korea is largely led by the US and other countries across the world, with China lagging far behind. One of the reasons for downplaying the Chinese impact is that Korean agencies are diversifying their business models to include merchandise sales, online concerts and digital music releases, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic reshaped the entertainment industry in general. In addition, top-ranked stars and groups with the four agencies -- Lisa of Blackpink, aespa, Twice, Stray Kids and others -- are scheduled to release new music starting in September. New, next-generation groups are also readying to foray into the competition, which is expected to nurture their own fan groups in a way that bolsters the artist portfolios of the agencies going forward. K-pop going through transformation  Since 2000, Korea’s K-pop industry has undergone a series of dramatic transformations. S.M. Entertainment and YG Entertainment spearheaded entry into the Japanese market and proved the value of their marketing strategy by focusing on Japan’s unique idol fandom culture. In the years that followed, agencies rode the YouTube bandwagon and digital music platforms to reach out to fans across the globe. As demonstrated by the success of BTS, Blackpink and Twice, agencies with artists supported by global fandoms came to solidify their market positions, and share prices reflected this. Last year, entertainment agencies hit a major challenge with the coronavirus, which made it impossible to run offline concerts and other events such as fan meetings, disrupting the conventional marketing strategy and business model. Hybe, which rapidly drew talent from diverse sectors, built its own digital subscription platform for BTS, while entering new business categories such as gaming tailored for BTS fans and strengthening the merchandise business. Due to the proliferation of contactless culture, Hybe organized online concerts on a large scale. It is estimated that online concerts during the COVID-19 period sold 200,000 to 800,000 tickets. Since there is no limit to the number of online viewers and agencies have also linked the events to merchandise sales, their profits tend to stay at a high level. Other agencies are following suit by developing their own platforms, and by diversifying income structures and target markets. As far as global platforms are concerned, the agencies continue to use YouTube and Spotify to publicize their artists and distribute digital content for the global market. In the process, for Korean entertainment firms, China has been put on the back burner in terms of marketing and sales, as the neighboring country has kept tight control over the distribution of Korean content in recent years. The Chinese government’s crackdown on fandom culture is not limited to Korean stars. Popular Chinese celebrities such as Fan Bingbing, Zheng Shuang and Zhao Wei have also suffered setbacks after being dealt heavy fines or having their film credits removed, reflecting the deepening anti-celebrity policies in China.",iu,3.0,"The article briefly mentions IU as one of the K-pop stars affected by China's crackdown on fan accounts, but the focus is not specifically on her or her work as a singer, songwriter, or actress.

The duet is opening a new chapter in their music career with new collaboration album “Next Episode,” releasing Monday evening. The seven-song package provides support and comfort to people when they hit rock bottom in their lives, brother and songwriter Lee Chan-hyuk and sister Lee Su-Hyun said during an online press conference. Fronted by lead track “Fall,” featuring singer and actress IU, the latest print for the group is a collaboration album brimming with the voices of A-listers, including veteran singer Lee Sun-hee, rapper Beenzino, Crush, Sam Kim, Zion.T and Choi Jung-hoon of indie rock band Jannabi, and is the first of its kind. It took years for the duo to team up with IU, making a dream come true for fans who had yearned for such a collaboration between the two. Su-hyun said she came together with the singer-songwriter because AKMU was looking for an artist who could “efficiently deliver the message of ‘Fall’ to the public” and that IU was a perfect match to the song. “She is popular and able to persuade anyone,” Su-hyun said, adding their work with IU became the start of the whole collaboration album. The sister-brother tandem said their main song was inspired by the movie “The Greatest Showman.” Chan-hyuk added that the word “fall” could be interpreted as a dark term, but he aims to send out positivity. “The song sends a positive message of inclusion, just like the film. We wanted to convey a hopeful message that ‘however deep down you fall, if you’re beside me holding my hand, nothing will matter,” Chan-hyuk said. Speaking about the music video to be released later, Chan-hyuk talked about how he falls endlessly. “If you get to see the clip, I continuously tumble down until the point where I hold Su-hyun’s hands. There’s a little tweak in this part. The screen is flipped upside down at this point to make it seem as if we’re soaring up in the sky, rather than falling.” He added that those who grasp the message of the song would be able to picture the duality of this particular scene. Chan-hyuk said the star-studded album centers around one common idea -- transcendent freedom, a term newly coined by the two. If their 2019 album’s “Freedom” explains freedom by “wanting to walk without clothes,” the pair tried to show a more buoyant mood in the latest album. The singer described the meaning behind transcendent freedom as an “extraordinary power that goes beyond people’s physical limits, allowing people to unplug from any external influence.” Chan-hyuk added that he aims to bring out a message not to be swayed even if one descends. When asked about what they wish to achieve through “Next Episode,” the chart-topping duo said they had set their hearts set on offering succor to those who are ready to make a leap of faith. “I started my music journey with the bold ambition to change the world with our music. But I realized that changing everyone is not the destination we are heading to,” Chan-hyuk said. He believes that the beauty of the world lies in diversity and wishes to encourage those set for a new change. From releasing an album with all jointly recorded songs to listing his name as a co-composer for Chan-hyuk, the duo also said they made several leaps of faith through the collaboration album. “It was the first time producing an album filled with other singers,” the two said together. The pair likened teaming up with seven artists to the Avengers, adding that they are beyond grateful to pair up their voices with the nation’s leading singers. A special space allowing music lovers to delve into transcendental freedom will also be available at Beaker’s flagship store in Yongsan, central Seoul, starting Tuesday until Aug. 8.

The singer bought a residential unit of Eterno Cheongdam, currently under construction by Hyundai Engineering & Construction, according to local news outlet Biz.Hankook. The 20-story villa with four floors underground has one or two residential units on each floor starting from the second floor above ground. A 488-square-meter super penthouse of the riverside luxury villa, one of the highest-end residential properties in Seoul, is currently on sale for 30 billion won. The residence purchased by the K-pop star measures around 244 square meters. She is likely to complete her payment all in cash, as loans for a residential property valued at 1.5 billion won are completely banned in the city. As she bought the new residence, she also sold another real estate property recently. In May 2012, she bought a housing unit measuring 173.82 square meters in Bangbae for 840 million won, and she had her residence registered at the property. She sold it in June 2019 for 860 million won. The 28-year-old owns other real estate properties around Seoul as well.

She also owns 1,524 square meters of land, valued at some 800 million won. The K-pop star is believed to have received the green light from the district office to purchase the residential property.

The agreement will allow listeners overseas to resume enjoying songs by popular Korean artists, including IU and Zico, which were removed temporarily from the Spotify platform from the beginning of March. The platform operator at the time explained that the songs were not available because it failed to reach an agreement on renewing the licensing contract with Kakao Entertainment before it terminated. “We are pleased that Kakao Entertainment’s content and artists are back on Spotify, allowing our over 345 million global listeners across 170 countries to once again enjoy the music they love,” Spotify said in a statement. “We are delighted that our Korean listeners will now also be able to enjoy this local music alongside our over 70 million songs and more than 4 billion playlists.” “Through our diverse partnerships around the world including Spotify, we hope that music lovers around the world can easily access our artists and music,” Kakao Entertainment said in a statement. According to music industry sources, one of the key reasons why talks failed earlier was that the Korean company had been asking for separate licensing deals for the Korean market apart from the rest of the countries that Spotify operates in. The global streaming giant had reportedly refused to accept the offer. Securing popular Korean artists’ tracks, which are distributed by the Kakao affiliate, has been considered as one of the key factors required for Spotify’s expansion in the Korean market since it began its service in February. The Korean music distributor also runs Korea’s largest music streaming platform Melon, which enjoys a 37.5 percent local market share.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2570220,K-pop fans hung out to dry over Kakao-Spotify music licensing termination,2021-03-05,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2021/03/05/20210305000541_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Last weekend, global K-pop fans on Spotify faced a blackout of hundreds of songs by popular artists, including Zico, Mamamoo and IU, after the Swedish audio giant's licensing agreement with South Korea's top music distributor Kakao M Corp. came to an end. While some music has since been restored under artists' separate labels, Spotify Technology SA and Kakao M, now known as Kakao Entertainment Corp., said discussions for a new deal are ongoing. The South Korean company's music has been available for Spotify's global listeners since 2016. But the two companies failed to come to terms for a renewal despite continued talks, according to an industry official. Online K-pop forums and social media have been abuzz about the move, with artists, such as Epik High's Tablo, voicing complaints over the removal. ""Why is it always the artists and the fans that suffer when businesses place greed over art?"" the hip hop artist tweeted earlier this week. The conflict is the latest development since Spotify's turbulent landing in South Korea -- the sixth largest music market in the world -- early last month. Spotify landed in the country without securing a licensing agreement for the local market with then Kakao M, which holds 37.5 percent of the songs on the top 400 Gaon Music Chart of the Korea Music Content Association. The South Korean company has pointed the finger at Spotify for the recent removal of songs, saying the streaming giant simultaneously pursued deals for both the global and South Korean markets. Spotify said in a statement that it has tried to renew the global deal for a year and a half. ""It is our hope that this disruption will be temporary and we can resolve the situation soon,"" the company said in a statement. ""We remain committed to working with local rights holders including Kakao M, to help grow the Korean music market and overall streaming ecosystem together."" Talks for the local deal are also currently under way, according to company officials. Experts say the tussle over the licensing deal emerged as K-pop expanded its presence in the global music market. Spotify has been operating K-pop playlists since 2014 and the company said that the share of K-pop listening on its platform jumped by more than 2,000 percent, with total streaming time reaching 180 billion minutes. ""As K-pop becomes more popular, there's more profit to go around, leading to conflicting interests,"" said Lee Gyu-tag, a professor of cultural studies at George Mason University Korea. Kakao Entertainment's parent Kakao Corp. competes with Spotify through Melon, the country's largest music streaming service. Melon holds a tight grip over the country's music streaming market with nearly nine million monthly active users. But its user base pales to Spotify's over 345 million global listeners. The music distributor has snubbed global music giant Apple Music in the past, with the US tech giant failing to secure many local titles when it launched in South Korea in 2016 and has since struggled to gain a significant market presence. Kakao Entertainment currently has a licensing deal with Apple Music for markets outside of South Korea, according to a company official. The conflict also comes as Kakao is aiming for its entertainment business to enter overseas markets. On Thursday, the local tech giant launched Kakao Entertainment Corp. by merging Kakao M and webcomic unit Kakao Page with goals to take on the global entertainment market based on its trove of artists and original content. As of now, Spotify faces growing pressure to clinch deals with Kakao M or risk losing its presence in South Korea and its global K-pop fans. ""The clash between the two companies was inevitable,"" Lee said. ""It's now important to watch what precedent they will set.""

The move has prevented global K-pop fans from listening to songs of major South Korean artists, including IU and Apink, through Spotify. The Swedish company said it has failed to reach an agreement on a new license deal with Kakao M, South Korea's top music distributor, despite efforts to clinch a contract over the past 1 1/2 years. Spotify launched its music streaming service in South Korea last month as it seeks to succeed in the local market with playlists specifically tailored for Korean listeners. It has faced heated competition against established homegrown services, including Kakao Corp.'s Melon, Genie Music under telecom operator KT Corp. and rival carrier SK Telecom's Flo.

Spotify said the expiration of its global license deal with Kakao M has nothing to do with the latest launch of its Korean service. But Kakao M said the suspension came in accordance with Spotify's policy under which it seeks to clinch deals on domestic and global services simultaneously. The two companies said they will continue to hold negotiations. Spotify has more than 60 million songs on its playlist, with 345 million users across 170 markets.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2561258,A look back on IU’s 13-year music career,2021-02-19,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2021/02/19/20210219000192_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Artist to release fifth studio album soon “I want to say this to those people who were born rough yet special, including my friend. You’re not strange but stellar.” IU’s latest single, “Celebrity,” embodies that message -- for her friend, for herself and for everyone who finds it hard to love themselves, as the singer wrote in her introduction to the song. The song’s lyrics started off as a letter to a friend who is often considered odd by others. Writing down the words, IU realized they were not only for her friend but for herself and everyone else too, because we all have those moments in life when we feel out of place and isolated. Consolation is one of the core themes of the singer-songwriter’s work, as seen in “Through the Night” and “Dear Name.” But unlike those calm and soothing scores, “Celebrity” features a bright electro-pop sound. IU is attempting the genre for the first time in her 13-year career. With the prerelease single, IU has not only succeeded in landing atop the charts, she has also proved herself as a solid musician, one who is still evolving and expanding. IU stands at the pinnacle of South Korea’s entertainment scene, expanding her career both as a K-pop soloist and an actor. The 28-year-old tops the charts anytime she releases a new song, whether it’s a ballad or a dance, pop or folk song, and has led popular drama series from “My Mister” (2018) to “Hotel del Luna” (2019), building a reputation as a well-rounded entertainer like no other. On Sept. 18, 2008, IU -- real name Lee Ji-eun -- debuted as a solo singer with the EP “Lost and Found,” led by the track “A Lost Child.” Singing sad ballads at the age of 15, IU initially failed to grab listeners’ hearts. She says she thought at the time that the album might be her first and last. The next year, she released her first full-length album, “Growing Up,” led by dance track “Boo,” followed by another dance set. “IU…IM,” led by “Marshmallow,” was a breakthrough for IU. With “Nagging” (2010), featuring Lim Seul-ong of then-popular boy band 2AM, IU landed at No. 1 on the domestic music charts for the first time. Perhaps the start to IU’s triumphant career, “Good Day” topped the charts and music shows upon its release. IU finally made her name known, especially with the powerful triple high notes that became a sensation in and out of Korea. In the domestic music scene -- then dominated by K-pop idol groups and big-name ballad singers -- IU proved that a young female soloist could succeed with dance songs. In 2011, IU dropped her second album -- “Last Fantasy” led by “You & I.” This song was the first of IU’s age-oriented songs and was followed by “Twenty-Three,” “Palette” and “Eight.” While “You & I” was a huge commercial success, it was acclaimed for its authentic sound, incorporating big band music and instrumentals. IU also made inroads into Billboard with this track, topping the K-pop Hot 100 for the first time and peaking at No. 3 on the World Digital Song Sales chart. In 2013, with her third studio set, “Modern Times,” IU deviated from her usual sweet airy sound and girlish image. The lead track, “The Red Shoes,” incorporates various genres from jazz to swing and features an elaborate chorus. Not only did she prove herself capable of performing different styles of music, she landed at the top of the charts with all 13 tracks from the album. IU had a turning point as a singer-songwriter with the acoustic pop song “Friday,” included in the repackaged version of “Modern Times.” The seasonal love song “Not Spring, Love, or Cherry Blossom” further proved her capabilities as both a writer and a producer. With EP “Chat-shire” in 2015, IU took on the production of a whole album, marking the start of her career as a versatile artist capable of producing, writing and performing her own music. She also got bolder about expressing her personal thoughts through music. In “Twenty-Three,” she sings of the contradictory emotions she experienced at that age, caught between childhood and adulthood. The 2014 EP “A Flower Bookmark,” featuring remade oldies from the 1980s and 1990s, highlighted her talents of reinterpretation as she struck a careful balance between preserving the original song and delivering it through her authentic sound. In 2017, IU released “A Flower Bookmark 2” and said the series would continue. IU takes her introspection deeper with “Palette,” from her eponymous fourth regular album released in 2017. The lyrics show how much more mature and stable the 25-year-old IU has become. She presents the diverse colors of life, just like a palette, singing, “I got this. I’m truly fine.” This song also marks G-Dragon’s first time collaborating with a female solo artist outside YG. With time, IU became more daring, writing about her thoughts through unique sounds unheard elsewhere. “Bbibbi,” a laid-back alternative R&B single released in 2018 to mark her 10th anniversary, and “Blueming,” an upbeat song about the “blue” experience of falling in love, are good examples of this. The last of IU’s age-oriented songs, “Eight,” made in collaboration with BTS member Suga, nostalgically explores the diverse emotions faced by the two 28-year-old artists. With “Eight,” IU and Suga made it to the top of Billboard’s World Digital Song Sales chart. Besides G-Dragon and Suga, IU has collaborated with some of the world’s best musicians, transcending genres and generations. They include rapper Zico, Oh Hyuk of band Hyukoh, legendary hip-hop trio Epik High, first-generation K-pop idol group g.o.d and veteran actor-musician Kim Chang-wan. Now an established actor, IU boasts a TV presence as well. Not only does she lead a number of popular dramas, she has actively taken part in the production of music for TV. She has also had huge hits with variety shows featuring her such as “Hyori’s Homestay” (2017) and “House on Wheels” (2020). With “Celebrity,” released Jan. 27, IU gave fans a peek at her fifth studio album, slated to be dropped in the weeks to come. While no other information about the album has been released, and the exact release date is still unknown, the prerelease single piqued anticipation about what wonders and soothing messages IU will unravel through the set.

While the Swedish company is one of the top audio streaming services in the world, with 345 million users across 93 markets, it is up against established homegrown services in South Korea -- the sixth-largest music market in the world -- such as tech giant Kakao Corp.'s Melon, Genie Music under telecom operator KT Corp. and rival carrier SK Telecom's Flo. As of October last year, Melon ranked as the country's top music streaming service with 8.81 million monthly active users, followed by Genie Music at 4.47 million and Flo at 2.86 million, according to mobile tracker IGAWorks. Spotify has said it aims to succeed in the local market with playlists specifically tailored for South Korean listeners that are created by using its latest algorithm and a team of K-pop experts. The audio streaming giant's trove of over 70 million tracks and 4 billion playlists, however, lacks songs of some major South Korean artists, such as IU, leaving many wondering whether it may follow the path of Apple Music, which struggled to draw users after failing to secure local music. Spotify has yet to clinch a deal with entertainment giant Kakao M, the country's top music distributor and a Kakao subsidiary. The Swedish audio giant is still betting on its broader platform taking off, with its podcast service set for launch in the country sometime this year. The company said it will focus on securing local podcast content as well as providing original and exclusive podcasts for the country. Spotify will also have to fend off competition from new contenders in the audio streaming sector, such as audio-chat social media service Clubhouse. The invite-only app, developed by US-based Alpha Exploration Co., has recently taken South Korea's online forums by storm, with users selling app invitations online for as much as 19,000 won ($17). Spotify's entry into South Korea has prodded local rivals to bolster their services. Genie Music said early this month that it will provide a real-time playlist of songs that appear on TV music competition programs and establish an open music database feature in which users can participate.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2552781,[Digital Simplicity] Spotify and Teleparty signal importance of new digital experience,2021-02-06,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2021/02/05/20210205000304_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Audio streaming service Spotify made its debut in South Korea on Tuesday, signaling a fresh round of competition among streaming apps. A lot of digital music fans here have high hopes for Spotify, which has a library of some 60 million songs and allows users to listen to plenty of music under a “freemium” plan. The high level of attention Spotify attracts actually reflects the solid positions of Korean streaming players such as Melon, Genie Music and Flo. Even though Apple Music, a digital music service offered by Apple, has been available in the local market, its influence is far smaller than Korean rivals, and some predict that things might change with the official debut of Spotify. As part of the initial marketing campaign, users can listen to all music on Spotify free-of-charge for three months, after which paid subscriptions are required. Spotify’s subscription plan is set at 10,900 won ($9.70) for a single user and 16,350 won for dual accounts, before tax. Given that local streaming providers charge an average of under 8,200 won per month, Spotify’s plan is not so competitive in terms of pricing. Korean media outlets also point out that Spotify, just like Apple Music, does not boast the Korean catalog to meet demand here. For instance, neither Spotify nor Apple Music offer albums from IU, one of the country’s most popular singers, which is a make-or-break issue for many digital music users in Korea. But it is too early to brush off the potential of Spotify. The giant music streaming provider has a whopping 320 million users in 92 countries and carves out a respectable 34 percent share in the global music service market. Not only its vast music library, but also a rich reserve of playlists help sort out a selection of music tailored for users with different tastes. Melon, which controls 34 percent of the Korean digital music market, has a library of 40 million songs, with 8.78 million users. The other major players are Genie Music (23 percent), Flow (16 percent) and YouTube Music (14 percent). Recently, Melon drastically overhauled the design of its streaming app, perhaps aware that its competitive edge might be tested as Spotify enters the Korean market. Melon’s new interface appears to be modeled on leading streaming apps, but some might be dissatisfied with the design since many of the detailed options are hidden. The real test, meanwhile, is whether Korean streaming apps can provide something different or essential to users who are now quite familiar with customization and personalization functions based on artificial intelligence and other related technologies. Instead of searching for new music, users want apps or services to go out and pick the best selections suitable for different situations. The core competition now lies in the technological depth that can appeal to tech-savvy users. In line with the dominance of streaming apps in the music field, video services have shifted to streaming mode too, and something innovative is afoot. A range of music and video streaming apps were originally designed to help users individually enjoy what they want to listen to or watch. In recent months, users of such streaming apps want to join others and create a simultaneous and collective experience. Teleparty, formerly Netflix Party, is one case in point. The service allows Netflix users to watch TV with friends online, as the video playback is synchronized. As with other sports and PC games, music and video users want to talk about content with friends in real time, creating digital experiences that are more entertaining and rewarding that those enjoyed alone. It is not certain whether Korean streaming players will come up with services similar to Teleparty, but what’s clear is that they have to develop better and more innovative digital music experiences to shore up their market position in the coming years.

Korean users have access to over 60 million tracks and 4 billion playlists, the global audio streaming subscription service said. Spotify also emphasized that it aims to capture the local market with playlists specifically tailored for South Korean users, as well as its high-quality recommendation engine. Currently, the global streaming platform provides two different kinds of subscription options in Korea -- Premium Individual that costs 10,900 won ($9.80) a month and Premium Duo that costs 16,350 won a month, exclusive of taxes. With the premium service, subscribers can access music streaming with high sound quality, play downloaded music without an internet connection and enjoy music with no ad interruptions. Premium Duo is a two-person plan that offers two separate Spotify Premium accounts on one bill. Listeners in Korea can try out Spotify’s premium service free for seven days on their mobile phones without providing any credit card information. Those who provide their credit card information can enjoy premium services for three months free of charge. These free trials will be available through the end of June. Meanwhile, local music industry insiders have downplayed Spotify’s possible impact on the highly competitive Korean market. It has yet to sign deals to provide Korean music tracks from local music distribution giants like Kakao M, which owns tracks of popular singers such as IU, Zico and Monsta X. Many industry insiders are also curious as to why Spotify decided to launch without Kakao M. Spotify had announced on Dec. 18 that it would launch its service in Korea sometime in the first half of 2021. “We are still talking with Spotify (about distributing our songs through their platform),” a Kakao M spokesperson told The Korea Herald on Tuesday. Kakao M runs Korea’s largest music streaming platform Melon, which enjoys a 37.5 percent local market share. Korean platforms Genie and Flo follow in market share and the three platforms together account for more than 80 percent of the market here. The lack of Korean artists’ tracks has been considered one of the main obstacles that global audio streaming companies, such as Apple Music, face in seeking to expand in the Korean market, according to music industry sources. Apple Music, which entered the Korean market in 2016, struck deals with three entertainment companies -- SM Entertainment, JYP Entertainment and YG Entertainment -- for their artists’ music tracks. However, it also failed to sign on Kakao M. Meanwhile, Spotify on Tuesday named David Park as its managing director for Korea. “Our team on the ground has been working closely with local artists, labels and cultural tastemakers to offer an unrivaled music listening and discovery experience, ensuring that Spotify is going to be loved by listeners and artists in Korea,” Park said in a statement. Before joining Spotify, Park worked as the general manager at UberEats Korea, leading its diversification and expansion here.

The musical will focus on the death of the fictional detective in the short story “The Adventure of the Final Problem,” published in 1893. Stage actors Kim Jong-gu, Hong Seung-an and Kim Chan-jong have been cast as Doyle. Jeong Min, Cho Pung-rae and Paek Ki-beom are to play Holmes. Director Seong Jae-jun is to lead the show, complete with the musical numbers created by composer Hong Jeong-eui. Comedy musical “Who Lives in Kuroi Mansion?” is set to premiere next month at Plus Theater in central Seoul, where it will run Feb. 18 to March 21. The story, set during the Japanese colonial period, revolves around Hae-woong and Ok-hee and the ghosts at Kuroi Mansion. Stage actors Jung Wook-jin and Choi Min-woo are to play Hae-woong, while Song Na-young and Hong Na-hyun are to play Ok-hee, with director Kim Dong-hyun at the helm. The musical was selected through the Chungmu Art Center’s debut program for writers in 2018, and Pyo Sang-ah wrote the script. Though it is set in dark times, the musical bills itself as a humorous production with elements of comedy. Occult film “The Priests” has been made into a musical, which is set to run Feb. 25 to May 30 at Uniplex in central Seoul. The 2015 film, starring big-name actors Gang Dong-won, Kim Yoon-seok and “Parasite” star Park So-dam, was seen by 5.45 million theatergoers. The supernatural mystery thriller featured two Roman Catholic priests, played by Kang and Kim, who try to help a young girl possessed by an evil spirit, played by Park.

BTS also took the top spot in the category of the most-streamed global group in 2020. 2020 Wrapped, which compiles data from Jan. 1 to Nov. 15, is the operator’s annual flagship campaign that shows how its 320 million users around the world use their platform. Singer IU topped the list of most-streamed Korean female artists, while Agust D, better known as Suga of BTS, was ranked the most-streamed male artist last year.

According to Spotify, South Korea -- the sixth-largest music market globally -- is an important market for accomplishing its mission to connect creative artists with music fans worldwid. The global audio streaming subscription service will give Korean listeners access to over 60 million tracks and over 4 billion playlists, the company said. The streaming platform operator, known for its AI-based music curation service, highlighted that it will enable diverse Korean artists to reach local music fans, as well as Spotify’s 320 million global listeners. Although this is the first time that Spotify is entering Korea‘s streaming market, it is not its first time working with local musicians. The Swedish audio streaming provider debuted its first K-pop playlist in 2014. Since then, its users have have streamed more than 180 billion minutes of the genre and added K-pop tracks to more than 120 million Spotify playlists. The share of K-pop listening has increased by more than 2,000 percent in the last six years, according to Spotify. According to the local music industry insiders, the global streaming giant’s performance in the Korean market will depend on whether it can successfully provide Korean artists’ tracks through the platform by joining hands with large K-pop powerhouses here. In 2016, another global audio streaming service provider, Apple Music, entered the Korean market, signing contacts with three entertainment companies — S.M. Entertainment, JYP Entertainment and YG Entertainment. However, it failed to provide tracks of Kakao M’s artists, which include popular singers like IU. This has been considered one of the limitations to Apple Music’s expansion in the local market, according to music industry sources. Currently, Kakao runs Korea’s largest music streaming platform Melon, which has a more than 35 percent share of the local market, followed by Korean platforms Genie and Flo. The three platforms together account for more than 80 percent of the market here. Regarding questions on whether it had signed contracts with all the main local entertainment companies and how many Korean tracks it will provide to Korean users, Spotify declined to answer. “We cannot comment on specific licensing agreements,” a Spotify spokesperson told The Korea Herald on Friday. “We are committed to ensuring close alignment and partnership with key stakeholders through mutual, collaborative and transparent discussions.” By Song Seung-hyun ()",iu,3.0,"The article does not specifically mention IU or 아이유 (1), but it indirectly references her by noting that Apple Music failed to provide tracks from Kakao M’s artists, including popular singers like IU (2).

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2434207,"[Digital Simplicity] IU, 8K display and next-generation gaming",2020-09-26,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2020/09/11/20200911000368_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Last Saturday, singer IU’s newest live performance video was revealed on YouTube. It was a landmark event since the video was formatted in 8K resolution, which easily outperforms 4K display. A small number of those who purchased the prohibitively expensive and visually expansive 88-inch OLED TV from LG Electronics were lucky enough to get a glimpse of what the 8K technology could offer, thanks to the stunning image featuring IU’s equally exquisite live performance. Just in case you have no idea who IU is, let me introduce her a bit. IU (whose name is Lee Ji-eun) is a top singer-songwriter and actress and has a huge fan base here -- so much so that a lot of Korean music fans helplessly stick to home-grown streaming music services largely because Apple Music, apparently due to copyright and contract issues, does not provide her music in the Korean market. The 8K video uploaded on YouTube, in which IU belted out her hit song “You & I” on “You Heeyeol’s Sketchbook” music program, garnered more than 500,000 views, and is now deemed as a reference to check whether your 8K display works properly. I watched the video with a new 4K computer monitor I bought recently. It was immensely impressive, even on 4K display. When I raised the resolution setting from 4K to 8K (fully aware that my screen is not designed to support 8K) on YouTube, the screen froze. It seems that my computer system, even with high-end options, found it hard to handle the enormous amount of digital data needed to stream 8K video. What should be noted is that KBS, a state-run TV station which aired the special program, recorded IU’s performance in 8K resolution but opted for YouTube to distribute the showcase piece. Under the current TV infrastructure, local TV stations are ill-equipped to broadcast 8K video seamlessly. I reckon that this is why KBS decided to let those who have 8K TVs and top-end desktop computers check out the eye-popping quality of the video through YouTube. For 8K TV makers such as LG Electronics and Samsung Electronics, IU’s live performance video is a blessing. Thanks to the high-profile video whose view count is likely to go up on the strength of IU’s popularity, TV makers can expect that the next-generation TV would be more readily accepted in the market, accelerating the shift from 4K to 8K. A similar technological shift is underway in the gaming industry. Both Microsoft and Sony are now getting ready to launch their next-generation video consoles later this year, promising better graphics and performance. The new machines support 4K video at 128 frames per second, a clear upgrade from today’s mainstream gaming systems. Microsoft, in particular, pins high hopes on Xbox Game Pass, a video game subscription service, which is “Netflix for video games.” Many Korean gamers at major online communities are talking about whether such subscription services could succeed, especially after Microsoft surprised the market this week by acquiring renowned US-based game developer Bethesda for $7.5 billion. Some users are considering PC-based gameplay after buying a Xbox Game Pass, while bypassing the purchase of the new console. The reason is the much-awaited debut of next-generation graphics cards, namely Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3080 and 3090 series. On Wednesday, two US tech YouTubers -- Marques Brownlee and Linus Sebastian -- rolled out videos introducing the sizzling appeal of 8K gaming powered by RTX 3090 graphics cards. Both videos were based on LG’s 88-inch OLED TV, whose retail price in Korea is set at more than 44 million won (about $37,000). To enjoy watching IU’s live performance in 8K format on a big screen, you would have to spend a lot of money upgrading your desktop computer system. The full-fledged 8K video, whether it’s a live performance on YouTube or gaming, requires the latest CPU, graphics card, TV set and other related components for a powerful desktop PC. Is it worth it? If you watch IU’s performance in 4K or lower resolution and find it good enough, a pricey upgrade to the 8K computer system could be premature. After all, 8K technology will eventually replace 4K in the coming years. Until then, many IU fans will likely feel that their smartphone screen is big enough as long as they can watch her impeccable performance.

On average, $302 was spent on general shopping, $184 on lodging, $155 on food and $138 on hallyu-related spending, according to the KTO report.

A game program where celebrities chase each other and snatch their opponents’ name tags, it is one of the most popular South Korean TV shows in Korea as well as abroad. Kicking off as a segment on the SBS reality show “Good Sunday” on July 11, 2010, “Running Man” became its own show in March 2017 when “Good Sunday” came to a close. The variety program is the third-longest-running Korean TV show in history, the first being the KBS talk show “Happy Sunday” and the second the MBC variety show “Infinite Challenge,” which respectively spent 17 years and 13 years on the air. “Running Man” ranked among Koreans’ top 10 TV shows from 2013 to July 2019, according to Gallup Korea, and enjoys a wide fandom overseas. When “Running Man” kicked off, there were similar entertainment programs on other channels. While those shows were set in rural areas, “Running Man” declared that it would host an urban chase where the participants would run around and engage physically with each other. “Running Man” took its chases to other Asian countries, where it became hugely popular. Then it was localized and exported to nine countries including China, Japan, Singapore and Indonesia. “Running Man” was not without troubles. It hit a low point in the second half of 2016 after its main producers moved to the show’s Chinese production. The sudden departure of rapper Gary, who had been a regular member of the cast for six years, in October that year brought about the biggest crisis for the show. While the show was expected to fold in February 2017, the addition of new members Jeon So-min and Yang Se-chan in 2017 helped revive it. Comedian Yoo Jae-suk, one of the original cast members, has been credited with bringing out the best in everyone and keeping the show going. Yoo’s efforts paid off, and he won the grand prize at the SBS Entertainment Awards in December. He won the same prize in 2012 and 2011, also for “Running Man.” Viewers appreciate the timely and creative selection of guests on “Running Man.” From actors to athletes, from rookies to big names, “Running Man” balanced the chemistry between its regular members and guests, sometimes scouting popular guests as regulars, as in the case of Jeon and Yang. According to SBS, the viewership ratings hit their peak on June 3, 2012, when soccer star Park Ji-sung and singer-actor IU appeared on the show.

The much-anticipated song has been co-written and composed by the singer-songwriter and the BTS member, who’s not only served as a producer but also lent his vocal for the track. Its title refers to the age of the two musicians, as both are 28 (Korean age). “As musicians of the same age, the two singers could relate to one another and create their own unique synergy in the song,” said IU’s agency EDAM Entertainment in a released statement. “Eight” follows IU’s 2019 EP “Love Poem.”  The uplifting song, which flourishes on nostalgic pop-rock band sound, blends IU’s soaring vocal with Suga’s soothing rapping. IU explained that the self-reflective song continues the legacy of her age-themed songs such as “Twenty-three” and “Palette.” ""If the previous songs used to take a form of an ‘essay’ through which I directly talked to listeners, ‘Eight’ is like a short novel that confesses my life as a 28-years-old by using a virtual figure and various metaphors,” wrote the singer in an introduction for “Eight.” “While I’m not sure whether it’s from my personal emotion or from the overall social atmosphere coming from the disaster, my 28 would be remembered by the recurring feeling of lethargy and longing for the ‘orange island’ where we felt freedom rather than sadness.” Part of the song’s lyric reads, “Under the orange sun we dance together without shadows / There’s no such thing as a decided goodbye / Let’s meet on that beautiful memory.” In a lead up to the song’s release, Suga also shared on his broadcast channel that the production process with IU has been very smooth, saying, “There wasn’t a lot of back-and-forth. Shortly after I sent the (song’s) beats to her, she sent it back with the melody.” He also added that he’s been listening to the song quite often after finishing working on it, while he rarely listens to the songs he’s worked on after they are completed. The musicians have pretty much kept the song in mystery, raising K-pop listeners’ expectations over the last few days. They’ve only released few teaser contents, including a cryptic teaser video featuring IU in a futuristic setting. The song’s accompanying music video switches between an animation and scenes featuring IU, where she walks into a futuristic room and puts herself into a trance to travel various phases of her life. One of the most popular singer-actors, IU has scored multiple chart-toppers throughout her over a decade-long career, carving out her own niche in the small-screen as well. Most recently, she dropped “Give You My Heart” for the soundtrack of Korean hit drama “Crash Landing On You.” This is not the first time that Suga, whose stage name is Agust D, has proved his producing prowess. He’s previously produced songs like “Song Request” by Lee So-ra, “Wine” by Suran, “We Don’t Talk Together” by Heize, as well as several numbers for BTS such as “Boyz with Fun” and “Ddaeng.” The BTS rapper is reportedly working on the group’s upcoming album.

""Eight,"" set for release next Wednesday, was jointly created by the K-pop queen and actress and the rapper from BTS, and comes with a rap part by the latter. The collaboration brings together the musical power of IU, arguably the country's most sought-after artist for music collaboration of today, with the glamour and talent of Suga from one of the most popular music bands in the world. Two teaser images of the digital single, released by IU's management agency Edam Entertainment, zoom in on IU's hands in two different conditions -- set aside and uncared for as opposed to jeweled and brought to attention -- against the ivory and orange-colored backdrops, subtly alluding to the upcoming song's dreamy vibes. The song reportedly deviates from the music styles the artists have explored so far, adding a new line of musical work to their repertoires. The joint project is the latest in a series of similar star-studded collaboration works the K-pop scene has spawned recently, a phenomenon that comes as the K-pop industry is struggling to shake off the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, another high-profile collaboration song, ""Refresh,"" brought together Zico and Kang Daniel, two of the hottest male solos in today's K-pop music scene. Zico, a rapper and producer who dominated local music charts for weeks with ""Any Song"" earlier this year, also teamed up with American DJ Steve Aoki to produce the song under a joint campaign between American beverage maker PepsiCo, Inc. and Korean music label Starship Entertainment. The Zico-Kang duo cut a glamorous sight in the song's music video promoting Korean aesthetics, appearing in traditional Korean overcoats against the backdrop of Korean heritage assets, such as the Korean writing system Hangeul, the traditional Korean house ""hanok"" and Korean performing arts. Also last week, the K-pop scene welcomed in an unprecedented collaboration coupling rapper and producer Tiger JK with Pengsoo, a wildly popular penguin character created by the national education broadcasting channel EBS. The simple, humorous yodel-inspired hip-hop song, ""This is Pengsoo,"" topped several real-time music charts last week, including Genie Music, becoming an immediate hit. Adding to the growing roll of A-list collaboration projects, Shofar Music said Wednesday its artist Bolbbalgan4 will unveil a collaboration song featuring K-pop phenomenon EXO's member Baekhyun. ""Butterfly and Cat,"" a track from Bolbbalgan4's upcoming album, will be prereleased on May 7 ahead of the album's official release schedule for May 13, the agency said. This marks the first music release by the flourishing female singer, featuring a fellow K-pop artist.

The Ministry of Health and Welfare has been working to issue a notice that it intends to revise the National Health Promotion Act to prohibit such marketing tactics, amid rising concerns that they encourage drinking. A ministry official told The Korea Herald that the notice about the legislation, which has been delayed due to the coronavirus outbreak, will be issued around the end of March. Rep.

And just in time, K-pop fans have recently been treated to a new album from IU, whose sweet, comforting vocals make her one of the most sought-after acts this time of the season. While the chart-topping singer-songwriter is beloved regardless of the weather, many of her emotional ballads have especially served as a remedy for winter blues, all the more for their poetic lyrics and her sophisticated delivery. Celebrating her return with the sweeping “Love Poem” album, here are 10 relaxing songs by IU that will keep you company on a winter night. 1. “Love Poem” (2019) Preceded by the release of IU’s latest “Love Poem” EP, the song is a warm ode to those struggling with life out there. Kicking off with somber piano chords, this sentimental ballad slowly swells into emotional richness that evokes a whirlwind of feelings. Its soul-stirring melody strikes a balance between sadness and darkness, but IU makes sure to heal wounded hearts by belting out, “Take a deep breath. I’ll sing for you who has forgotten how to cry out loud” in the refrain. The “Love Poem” EP had been delayed from its original release following the death of singer and actress Sulli, a close friend of IU. 2. “Dear Name” (2017) One of the double titles from IU’s popular “Palette” album, the evocative ballad begins with a gentle piano-and-string croon that climaxes into a breathtaking belt session where IU’s vocal prowess truly shines. Co-written by the singer herself and composer Kim Ee-na, the song “is a story of all of us, a song of consolation and reconciliation for everyone,” to quote IU, with its heartwarming lyrics addressing that all the “names” worldwide deserve to be known. IU performed the song at the 2017 Melon Music Awards with lesser-known aspiring musicians to better deliver the song’s message. 3. “Ending Scene” (2017) Also released on the singer’s “Palette” album, this fan-favorite stirring ballad, composed by singer-songwriter Sam Kim, details a post-breakup feeling. Smoothly escalating from IU’s sophisticated, narration-like vocals, the song soars into an impassioned refrain where IU hopes a lover finds someone that loves him as much as he loves himself. The song was covered by a number of fellow musicians, including BTS’ Jungkook and Paul Kim. 4. “Through the Night” (2017) This soft folk-ballad is one of IU’s most critical hits, speaking to her impressive songwriting skill. The self-written song portrays a woman who pens a heartfelt letter for her lover one peaceful summer night. Minimalized on instruments -- majorly led by acoustic guitar -- the song shimmers on her velvety vocals and poetic lyrics, receiving kudos from many music critics. The award-winning song has also appealed widely to the public for its comforting feelings, a key to its long-lasting success on the charts. IU once named “Through the Night” as one of her most representative songs, saying, “I wish people could remember this song after I die.” 5. “Knees” (2015) Providing listeners a home-like sense of comfort, “Knees” is soothing and calming to the heart. Composed and penned by IU, the singer reportedly wrote the song when she struggled with insomnia, missing her grandmother who used to put her to bed when she was young. Led by a simple piano chord, the song is beloved by many fans for its lullaby-like melody and nostalgic lyrics, praised as “one of the best songs to listen to on sleepless nights.” 6. “Only I Didn’t Know” (2011) From its heart-wrenching lyrics to saccharine melody, this tear-jerking ballad is the ultimate breakup anthem. Composed by renowned composer Yoon Sang and written by lyricist Kim Ee-na, the song has completely altered IU’s girl-next-door image from her breakout hit “Good Day” into a maturing artist on her own. The singer’s meticulous delivery of the song was also highly praised given that she was only 18 years old when she promoted it. 7. “Seeking for a Star” (2011) Composed by veteran singer-songwriter Kim Kwang-jin, this orchestral ballad released on IU’s “Last Fantasy” album sounds like a beautiful poem. Lyrically, it’s about missing someone she once loved before but can’t see anymore, equating that person to “a star in my heart.” Its highlight comes when the singer’s soaring vocals are paired with the mellifluous chorus done by Kim, who participated in the song to add a whole other layer. 8. “The First Breakup, That Night” (2010) This one’s not a typical breakup ballad. Composed and penned by singer-songwriter Yoon Jong-shin, its lyrics that crudely depict post-breakup feelings are easily relatable, while its melody that vacillates between melancholy and saccharine creates mixed feelings. The song, which was released on IU’s iconic “Real” EP, has been overshadowed by the album’s infamous “Good Day,” but it is another hidden gem that deserves better recognition. 9. “Riding on a Train” (2009) Part of her early discography, “Riding on a Train” may sound like a classical production due to its easy-on-the-ear melody, but fans still choose it as one of IU’s best works that they put on repeat. Lyrically, IU sings about how she hopes to leave behind lingering breakup pains and memories by hopping on a train. It’s been nearly a decade since its release, but this polished ballad never gets old. 10. “Lost Child” (2008) It may come as a surprise that IU was only 15 years old when she debuted with “Lost Child,” an intensive ballad track that embraces a darker side of the singer. The song failed to make a splash at the time, which proved difficult for IU in her early days, but the mature vocal styling and emotional expression made it an underappreciated work that has only recently resurfaced as an early masterpiece by the singer.

The numbers are higher than the ratings peak for “Arthdal Chronicles,” that was shown in the same slot, which was at 7.7 percent. Initial expectations had not been too high, as the drama was scheduled to air between the second and the third part of “Arthdal Chronicles,” a blockbuster production with a reported budget of 54 billion won ($45.7 million). Star scriptwriter pair Hong Jung-eun and Hong Mi-ran, widely known as Hong sisters, had a tough time with recent productions “Warm and Cozy” (2015) and “Hwayugi” (2017). “Hotel Del Luna” is the sisters’ 12th co-production. The casting also left many in doubt. Though IU, 26, has been on a winning streak with her choice of dramas, including “My Mister” (2018), Yeo Jin-goo, 22, has had his ups and downs. The storyline evolves around Jang Man-wol (IU), the owner of Hotel Del Luna, a hotel for spirits who have just died. Cursed with living forever, she hires the unwilling Goo Chan-sung (Yeo Jin-goo) to manage the hotel, gifting him with the ability to communicate with sprits. At the hotel, Goo sees to it that guests feel comforted, satisfying their unfulfilled desires in life. Some evil spirits are ready to take control of the weak-hearted Goo, but Jang always shows up to save him. It was the first time that IU has partnered with a younger, less-experienced male actor. The relationship between the two is the reverse of what viewers saw in “Guardian: The Lonely and Great God” (2016-2017). In that drama, the female lead (Kim Go-eun) was the delicate human-being who sees ghosts and the almighty male lead (Gong Yoo) protects her no matter what. Jang and Goo’s relationship works the other way around. As Jang, IU exhibits a sense of eternal loneliness hidden beneath a cranky and grumpy temper. Her stylish outfits are also a draw. Her mostly retro-style looks, include dramatic wide brim hats and long draped silk skirts. The Hong sisters have been famous for their charming female characters, creating memorable lead roles for Han Ye-seul in “Couple or Trouble” (2006), Shin Min-a in “My Girlfriend is a Gumiho” (2010) and Gong Hyo-jin in “Master’s Sun” (2013). It seems like IU is about to take up the baton. Yeo, on the other hand, is an actor who has been working hard to shake off the image he developed as a child actor. His acting had been somewhat stiff at the beginning, trying too hard, perhaps. But as the story develops, he has been blending in with the whole picture. On Sunday, Jang realizes she has fallen in love with Goo and wonders whether Goo is a reincarnation of her past lover. The 16-episode airs at 9 p.m. on cable channel tvN.

BTS, Red Velvet and Shinee’s Jonghyun were especially recognized atop the lists. Billboard picked BTS’ “Love Yourself: Answer” as the best K-pop album of the year.  “BTS has risen to the top of the global music industry,” commentary accompanying the list read. “They released their ‘Love Yourself’ album series, through which the group weaved a thematic discovery of self-love.” Following a thorough analysis of the album, Billboard praised it, saying “Though some may feel it’s a lot to ask of pop music to have substance as well as style, BTS’ ‘Love Yourself: Answer’ lacks in neither regard.” Jonghyun’s posthumous “Poet/Artist” album followed on the best albums list in the No. 2 spot. The lead vocalist of SHINee died in December last year. Billboard described Jonghyun as a “beloved singer, songwriter and producer” with incredible talents. “While it may be a tough listen for fans, the album is a beautiful, telling snapshot of the artist and poet Jonghyun was, and will continue to be for so many around the world,” it said. Sunmi’s “Warming,” Heize’s “Wish & Wind” and EXO’s “Don’t Mess Up My Tempo” rounded out the top five albums. Red Velvet’s “Bad Boy” topped the list as best K-pop song.  “This standout track fleshed out the second half of the act’s identity through its lush soundscape and vivid accompanying music video, which positioned the quintet as confident femme fatales,” Billboard said.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1801282,[Newsmaker] K-pop fans take action against online scalpers,2018-10-05,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2018/10/05/20181005000897_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"With so many events slated for this month featuring artists with huge fan bases, the race is on to get tickets to see our favorite singers live. Most concerts featuring world-famous singers can’t accommodate all the fans who want to be there, and ticket-reservation websites often crash as soon as tickets to a popular concert become available. The impact of too many people logging in at the same time is just too much for the servers. Knowing that competition will be fierce, fans gear up in advance as the day approaches, sometimes even resorting to improper means. They may use several friends’ IDs in hopes of purchasing one ticket, or they may use sketchy online ticket-trading sites. The more famous a singer is, the more of a nightmare it can be to get a ticket for a concert that should be a treasured memory. More and more, online scalpers are snatching up all the best seats by using macro programs -- computer programs that click continuously, buying more tickets faster than any human can. The scalpers then resell them to fans at extortionate prices. Until recently, there was no effective way to stop online scalping because there was no clear law against the practice. But as the problem got more and more widespread, singers and fans who fell victim to this dishonest form of ticket trading decided to take action. Veteran solo singer IU and her agency, Kakao M, drew praise for the definitive policy announced Sept. 27 on the agency’s official homepage. According to the announcement, if any ticket-trading irregularity is detected, the agency will buy the ticket to see the registration information, cancel the ticket and take legal action. If the ticket broker is found to be a member of IU’s official fan club, the person will be permanently eliminated from the club and can never attend another IU event. Not only singers but fans too are doing their best to hunt down online scalpers. Some fans are volunteering as “illegal ticket hunters,” searching for online posts advertising concert tickets at inflated prices and reporting them to the agency. Some agencies are compensating people who make such reports to encourage more fans to participate in stopping the ticket scalpers. As ticket release dates approach, tips can be found online showing how to report unauthorized ticket trading. Currently, unauthorized ticket trading constitutes a misdemeanor under the Minor Offenses Act, but only if it takes place on the scene -- that is, offline. Online ticket brokers cannot be prosecuted under the law as it is currently written.

He is among a growing line of Korean celebrities who -- upon being labeled “feminist,” or “anti-feminist” -- get thrown into the line of fire by the public. In a recent interview with BBC News Korea, the actor expressed concerns over feminism-related discussions in Korea degenerating into a battle of the sexes.  “This movement (in Korea) has taken the form of us versus them, spreading out in the form of a violent movement. ... There is the structure of ‘men, the discriminator of women’ versus ‘women, the victim.’ We must co-exist in this world, and I believe that the way to do so must be discussed in a less aggressive, more peaceful way,” said Yoo. The actor has defined himself as a feminist and called it “the most important human rights movement of today.” But he has been labeled as a misogynist by some feminists after he refused to apologize for joking about an online commenter being hit by a zucchini. (To read more about the incident, click: Yoo Ah-in moves to end ‘gender bashing’ dispute with netizens) Feminism most-widely refers to a range of movements that strive to achieve equal rights between the sexes. But the terminology has taken on a different connotation in Korea, due to what can be seen as gender-bashing by some portion of the movement. The phenomenon can be traced back to the misogynistic culture at some male-dominated online communities such as Ilbe. This, in turn, led to the creation of men-hating websites that “mirrored” the actions of their misogynistic counterparts. Being linked to “feminism” in any way has had severe repercussions for celebrities here. “My Mister,” a tvN drama, was recently accused of misogyny for a scene in which the female protagonist Lee Ji-an is beaten up by a loan shark. Her sarcastic comment “You like me, huh?” invited accusations that the scene attempted to romanticize dating violence, although there was no indication that the two characters were ever romantically involved and the character of the loan shark and the said scene were depicted in a negative way. IU -- who played Lee Ji-an -- was attacked on “radical feminist” websites for “selling the fantasy of dating older men,” referring to her on-screen relationship with her older boss. The singer-actor on Monday announced that she would take legal action over malicious online comments. Comedian Yoo Byung-jae was embroiled in controversy after pointing out that the drama never intended to justify violence. His comment, “Whenever I want to learn about feminism, they (women) push me away because I’m a Han-nam-chung (Korean male bug), and the other side pushes me away because I’m a hardcore-feminist,” made during a stand-up comedy show, also drew criticism. Being labeled “feminist” has an equally negative impact on a celebrity’s reputation.  K-pop star Seolhyeon of AOA recently was thrust into the maelstrom for un-following Yoo Ah-in, Yoo Byung-jae and IU on Twitter while following Luna of f(x), who advocates feminism. Despite the K-pop star remaining mum on the meaning of her Twitter activity, it was interpreted as supporting feminism and invited criticism from male-dominated online communities. A local media outlet on Monday even published the article “Seolhyeon, a traitor to male fans?” In March, Irene of Red Velvet came under fire for saying that she read the feminist novel “Kim Ji Young, Born 1982,” as fans posted online burned and torn up photos of the K-pop star.

At a media briefing held Wednesday, the producer and cast attempted to dispel concerns about the program, appealing to the public to see its sincerity. The tvN drama that airs at 9:30 p.m. on Wednesdays and Thursdays aims to portray how scarred souls heal each other, focusing on a relationship between a man in his mid-40s and a woman in her early 20s. The drama was criticized for setting up a couple with a 20-year age gap. With singer-actress Lee Ji-eun, better known by her stage name IU, taking the role of the 21-year-old woman, the controversy only deepened. Lee had already been mired in controversy for using the Lolita complex as a concept, particularly in her self-produced album “Chat-shire” in 2015. Despite her attempts, Lee has never been fully able to shake off criticism of impropriety. Lee admitted that she was concerned when offered the role, as it seemed likely to revive the old controversy. She said she hesitated in accepting it. “After reading the synopsis, I wanted to take the role. But I couldn’t readily say ‘yes,’ as I was worried that the drama might be swept up in unnecessary controversy because of me,” she said. “I even asked the producer if he knows about the controversy surrounding me, if he would be OK with it.” Producer Kim Won-suk managed to persuade her, stressing, “It’s not a love story, but a human story.” Speaking about his female lead, tears fell down the producer’s cheeks -- perhaps grateful to the actress, perhaps feeling sorry for her, too. “I have to thank her very much for playing the role well. The Lee Ji-ahn (Lee’s role in the drama) that actress Lee Ji-eun plays, is better than the one I prepare. She greatly contributes to the drama,” he said. To fend off possible criticism, the production team has paid extra attention to self-censoring some of the more provocative scenes. Though he is not fully content with the moves, the producer said it was necessary to achieving the drama’s original goal -- redefining the word “mister,” or “ajeossi” in Korean. “In recent years, the word seems to have come to have a negative meaning, making me wonder why. Through the drama, I hope to redefine the word and change its image,” Kim said. Kim also said the character played by Lee Sun-kyun, Lee Ji-eun’s “ajeossi,” is a reflection of himself. “The relationship between the two (main characters) is very odd,” he said, adding that such a relationship would typically be seen as inappropriate. “But we wanted to make viewers understand that the two become important for each other.” The producer who has directed hit series such as “Misaeng” and “Signal” said he is satisfied with the current series, having received more calls than ever from industry insiders complimenting him. He thinks “My Mister” has a unique, “previously unseen” female lead character. “Lee Ji-ahn is very dark. In many Korean dramas, female characters are often projections of the viewers. But Lee is too dark for that, hard to understand, too,” Kim said. Though the drama has a dark atmosphere, the producer considers it a comedy. “Comedy is what I would like to produce, but also it is the hardest to make. But essentially, ‘My Mister’ is a comedy, as it finds happiness in a tough life,” he said. Eight more episodes remain of the 16-episode series. It has so far garnered an average viewership rating of 4.5 percent.

It can’t be certain yet, but it seems drama series “My Mister” has drawn enough attention to kick off a good start. The first episode of tvN’s new series “My Mister” premiered Wednesday night to a high viewership rating of 3.9 percent, but viewers showed mixed reactions on the drama. The rating was the second highest of tvN’s Wednesday-Thursday lineup, following “Prison Playbook.” The series received massive attention from the public before its release, as the possible romance between the main characters with a large age gap stirred controversy.

Many viewers gave favorable reviews of the first episode, but many also expressed rage or discomfort toward both the concept and the series’ violent scenes. “There were no signs of romance in the first episode. Why do people react so sensitively over the issue (about romance between a middle-aged man and a young woman) that’s not even included in the drama?” one user posed in a review on Naver. “I really liked the actors and actresses, soundtrack and direction of the drama. Can’t wait until the next episode!” a dissenting voice on Naver said in a comment that garnered nearly 700 likes in four hours. “I thought I was watching a movie, not a TV drama. It’s amazing!” another comment says. “Was it necessary to include the scene that a male actor brutally hits a skinny and weak actress like that? Also, the actress says ‘You love me, right?’ after the beating. How horrible is it to glamorize violence with love?” a Twitter user said. The tweet was quickly shared 1,400 times with 1,253 comments, mostly agreeing with the opinion. “IU has bruises and scars on her face in the teaser video of the drama, as the concept of the drama is that a man clears her debt and beats her instead,” another Twitter user said. The tweet was retweeted over 25,900 times. “I looked up the scenario of the drama, as many people showed discomfort about it. But wait, what’s the drama trying to say?

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1546108,"After a blockbuster year, K-pop looks to keep momentum into 2018",2017-12-29,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2017/12/29/20171229000318_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"From an unprecedented mega-hit debut to groundbreaking overseas successes, K-pop had one of its biggest years in 2017 in terms of diversity, substance and global outreach. And it will continue to be at the forefront of the resurgence of “hallyu,” or the global popularity of Korean pop culture, into 2018, according to industry watchers. From the start, the 2017 K-pop calendar was filled with back-to-back releases, with the first half and early summer highlights predominantly coming from female stars.  Veteran act S.E.S released two anniversary singles and FNC’s flagship act AOA put out “Angel’s Knock” in early January. Seohyun and Taeyeon of Girls’ Generation released solo works in January and February, respectively, while TWICE stormed the music charts with “Knock Knock” and “Signal” in February and May. GFriend released two EPs and a repackaged record in the span of just six months, while smaller yet rising acts, such as Lovelyz and Gugudan, also deepened their discographies with new albums in the first quarter. Women also stood out in the singer-songwriter category, with artistic underdogs Suran and Heize both hitting big with “Wine” and “/// (You, Clouds, Rain),” respectively. IU also released her fourth full-length album, “Palette,” in April to critical and commercial success, while ex-FIN.K.L leader Lee Hyo-ri returned to the spotlight in July with “Black,” transforming herself from a sexy dance music icon into a genuine musician-artist. Ex-Wonder Girls chanteuse Sunmi successfully rebooted her music career with her captivating dance number “Gashina.” Big name boy bands lined up in the second half of the year to release their most ambitious projects to date. EXO of S.M. Entertainment released its fourth full-length album, “The War,” in mid-July and the much-hyped project group Wanna One, formed by survivors of idol audition show “Produce 101,” made one of the biggest K-pop debuts in history in August. K-pop titan BTS also dropped “Love Yourself: Her,” its biggest album so far, in mid September.  The alternative music realm also saw a slew of critical darlings released. In June, G-Dragon put out “Kwon Ji Yong,” his fourth solo album, full of semi-autobiographical songs that reflect the BIGBANG member’s insecurities and growing pains. Hip hop trio Epik High also released its ninth studio album, “We’ve Done Something Wonderful,” drawing on themes of regret, fear and alienation, in October. The year also saw a number of rising artists grow and mature. With successive hits “Red Flavor” and “Peek-A-Boo,” Red Velvet cemented its position as a S.M. Entertainment’s marquee girl group, as Girls’ Generation, the label’s previous female stronghold act, entered its twilight phase after key members bolted. Taemin of SHINee also successfully morphed his career into that of a serious solo artist with “Move.” “Taemin has shown how an artist can establish his or her image through stage and performance and maintain it in a consistent fashion. His potential has exploded sufficiently in his latest album,” said Kim Youngdae, a South Korean music critic based in the U.S. city of Seattle. Looking back, 2017 was also a critical year for K-pop rejuvenating and further advancing its global outreach -- with BTS achieving a major breakthrough in the United States and TWICE landing a record-smashing Japanese debut. BTS’ American breakthrough was stoked in earnest in May, when the band won the Top Social Artist award at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in May. The septet broke new ground with their “Love Yourself: Her” album, which debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 chart in September, while “DNA” and “Mic Drop,” the latter as a remix single by DJ Steve Aoki, both entered the crucial top 40 of Billboard’s main Hot 100 chart. Having remained under the radar to the U.S. public and media, BTS’ American fan community this year went full throttle in throwing its weight behind the K-pop sensation, organizing a national radio song request campaign to boost the group’s U.S. profile from niche to mainstream. The group made major television outings, including a live TV performance at the American Music Awards in November and appearing on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” and “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” TWICE made its first overseas gamble this year by debuting in Japan, a neighboring country that has a complicated and troubling history with South Korea. The payoff was huge, with album “#TWICE” being certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan, an honor bestowed on records with sales of over 250,000 copies. The group, which is represented by JYP Entertainment and includes Japanese and Taiwanese members, followed up its success with a fall Japanese single, titled “One More Time.” The ladies didn’t slouch at home either, as they dropped their first full-length studio album, “Twicetagram,” in late October and their winter album, “Merry & Happy,” earlier this month. The K-pop scene this year also had its share of controversies and tragedies, with undoubtedly the biggest being the tragic death of SHINee lead singer Kim Jong-hyun, who apparently ended his own life on Dec. 18 due to depression. The incident sent shock waves throughout the broader K-pop community around the world. In July, BIGBANG rapper T.O.P was convicted for smoking marijuana multiple times at his apartment in October of last year, while SHINee singer Onew was investigated by police after being accused of sexually harassing a woman at a night club in August. Critics and industry observers expect the K-pop industry to expand further in scale overseas. “BTS this year has shown a level of growth that was unforeseeable. I think K-pop in general will continue its ascent next year, as well. BTS will leave an even bigger footprint in 2018 in my opinion,” Im Jin-mo, a Seoul-based music critic, said. Kim Youngdae predicted that K-pop will see its overseas fans base diversify further in 2018. “As witnessed in KCON in America this year, K-pop in the U.S. is slowly expanding its fan base into the African American and Latin American communities. I think Korean music in general will continue to add new layers of fans in addition to previous ones fond of Asian culture,” noted Kim. The industry is also cautiously optimistic of a market rebound in China, where sales of Korean cultural products, including TV shows and music concerts, were impeded for more than a year over Seoul’s decision to host a U.S. anti missile system, commonly referred to as THAAD. South Korea and China have announced that they will cooperate to normalize their ties in many areas that had been strained for months over the THAAD deployment. Idol audition shows are forecast to be bigger than ever but some are wary that the genre’s novelty factor has started wearing off. TV showrunners will try to keep things fresh by throwing in more variety TV show elements to engage the audience. The gender of contestants will also be a key factor in the success of shows. “One of the reasons Wanna One struck big is that its members were males, as opposed last year’s ‘Produce 101’ team I.O.I being formed by female singers. In reality, the majority of idol music fans consist of females. With that in mind, I don’t think anyone can guarantee whether (‘Produce 101’) will continue its explosive run next year,” said Im.

With her latest offering “A Flower Bookmark #2,” IU aims to present herself as a thoughtful musician whose heart belongs to the bygone decades. Maybe it’s her signature breathy and light vocals, but the cover album doesn’t quite bear the weight and complicated emotions of the originals. IU flaunts her crystal clear voice in “Autumn Morning,” a 1991 folk tune by veteran singer Yang Hee-eun and guitarist Lee Byung-woo. But the song’s poetic lyrics are overshadowed by the singer’s overly sweet and soft voice. “Secret Garden,” a cover of Lee Sang-eun’s beloved song from 2003, suffers from the same problem. Lee‘s warm and mature voice delivers a message of encouragement, but the song’s power is diminished when delivered in IU‘s ear-tickling voice. “Last Night Story,” a remake of the 1988 hit by trio Sobangcha, is perhaps the most notable track from the EP. Instead of being a sugary fairy, IU experiments with rather deadpan and pouty vocals in the upbeat retro song, morphing into a late-night party girl who bemoans the previous night. One is glad to hear a song that fits the singer, finally making IU sound and look more her age. Other covers such as “Sleepless Rainy Night,” originally by Park Kwang-hyun in 1990 and made famous by Kim Gun-mo in 1992, and “Everyday With You” by ’80s icons Deulgukhwa, don’t sound that different from covers by other artists. And IU’s vocals, although flawless, are still too shallow for “Rapids,” a mournful poetic ballad by Jeong Mi-jo from 1972. The six cover songs that revisit the ‘60s to the early 2000s are well made and diverse, but IU may have been too ambitious in her bid to pay homage to the old classics she admires.

She feels that YouTube allows her to showcase herself as a more complex person. 　 “When I was on TV, people only knew me as a funny person. On YouTube, I eat and show different small things in my life. There’s this feeling that I as a person am being supported.” Kim Ki-soo, who began creating beauty videos on YouTube in 2012 and now hosts a beauty web series on Mobidic, agreed. “You can express 100 percent of your charm on YouTube.” Kim Ki-yeol, who livestreams online game-playing, often for 10 hours at a time, said that the platform brings an “incredible amount of freedom.”　 One significant advantage of the medium is the instant and constant feedback, the creators said. “I’m not overflowing with ideas, so I ask my subscribers for new ideas a lot,” said Kang. 　 Kang’s beauty tutorials dubbed into a comedic mix of Japanese and Korean languages have become a hit online. “That idea came from a subscriber, too, and it got great responses.” “I think the reason many people start a YouTube (channel) in the first place is to communicate with their fans, so I think that’s the right thing to do,” said Kim Ki-soo. “I think the appeal of a YouTube channel is that it’s something you create together with your subscribers.” Kim Ki-soo added that he believes the global attention has shifted from K-pop to K-beauty. The creators also spoke of the palpable difference between traditional broadcast media and digital media. The types of content that “work” are entirely different, they said. “When I first (started YouTube), (fellow comedienne) Ahn Young-mi and I went to the Korean Folk Village, dressed up in costumes and wigs and stayed there shooting skits for a whole day as you do for TV variety shows,” said Kang. “That video really did not get many views. That’s when I realized, this is a completely different world.” 　 Viewers prefer the more personalized content found online, she said, asking questions such as “What do these new spicy noodles taste like? How do you dye your own hair?” Content filmed in her own room with a minimal setup -- makeup tutorials, food reviews, daily routines -- fared much better, she noted. “It’s not a world where the output matches the input. I once tried to start a travel accommodations review on my channel, with my own money. I gave up, because the returns were nothing.” 　 Kang says she now makes around 2 million won ($1,759) per month purely for the number of hits her videos receive. “Right now, it’s nothing compared to what I made in television,” she said. Meanwhile Kim Ki-soo, who will be launching a set of his own makeup brushes later this year, has grown much larger as a YouTube personality. The profits are “significant,” he said.　 “Another advantage is that you really interact with people from all over the world. Most of my subscribers are in Australia, the UK, Italy and Japan,” he said. “I’m being invited to events there. (YouTube) really lets you learn about trends everywhere, but you have to keep up.” By Rumy Doo (doo@heraldcorp.com) A list of YouTube channels run by celebrities: Akdong Musician Suhyun - ""Mochi Peach"" (Beauty) BTOB Peniel - ""POV"" (Daily life) Comedienne Lee Guk-joo (Dance covers) Rainbow Oh Seung-ah - ""O'style"" (Beauty, exercise, food) f(x) Amber - ""What The Pineapple!""

Such is the quality of slime, a squishy, glue-based substance that has become a sweeping global fad of late. Online clips featuring the multicolored, dough-like form -- which comes in all sizes and can be transparent, opaque, glittery or gravelly -- have been appealing to a wide audience, free from language barriers.　 Jelly, goo, Flubber -- there are many terms for the glutinous object that people have been eager to play with, but in Korea, they’ve come to be called “liquid monsters.” YouTuber Chupop is the most popular liquid monster creator here, having amassed over 600,000 followers and millions of views with his wacky DIY videos. 　 The trend has caught on here since celebrities, including singer IU, began posting clips that showed their hands playing with shiny slime on social media. The K-pop musician’s Instagram feed is filled with videos of her fingers molding the semi-liquid dough, poking it relentlessly or shaping it into cute forms. “The original clip is 40 minutes long,” said one of her captions for a one-minute video featuring banana yellow slime. Return to childhood   One key reason behind the jelly-like object’s popularity can be found in the psychological comfort that tactile activities bring, according to art therapist Kim Eun-ji.　 “The types of unforced, mindless activities we loved as children, those that involve engaging our sense of touch -- like finger-painting unrecognizable shapes and forms with no logic -- bring us a sense of catharsis,” Kim told The Korea Herald.　 “They also remind us of our childhood. It’s a return to an extremely simple, childlike form of joy.” 　 From a psychological perspective, molding shapeless materials, such as clay and slime, allow their handler to express and examine their subconscious, Kim said. 　 “As a user can change slime’s form so effortlessly and without thinking, the shape that results can be a reflection of our deepest thoughts. Letting that out can be therapeutic.” 　 Another reason behind the fad is the visual aspect of slime. Infused with coloring, glitter and confetti, it’s pleasing to look at, according to Im Sae-mi.　 “Most of our customers are women in their 20s and 30s,” said Im, who is the CEO of Slime Korea, a company that began manufacturing and selling handmade slime online last year.　 “Many say they came to know about slime through Instagram. They started out by looking at videos of pretty slime, then wanted to try touching it for themselves.” Im had experimented exhaustively with different mixtures, finally landing on a well-guarded secret recipe that produces nonhardening, nonmelting and fragrant slime. “We use no harmful ingredients,” Im said. Beads and marbles can be mixed in to enhance the appearance. They also allow the slime to emit a crunching sound when handled, adding an audio element to the object. Im says social media has played a huge role in the spread of slime’s popularity. Online exposure through YouTubers and influencers has led to a marked increase in sales, she said. “We gifted our slime to one YouTuber a while back, and it was featured in one of her videos.” The following week, sales jumped twelvefold.　 “It’s gotten to the point where we’re limiting the number of orders per person because we can’t keep up with the demand,” she said. “Later on, we’re thinking of branching out to other kidult items like fidget spinners.”　 Numerous slime recipes circulate online. Mixtures are typically created with a glue base and a solidifying activator such as borax, or sodium borate. For those with sensitive skin or allergies, safety can be an issue. In March, it was reported that an 11-year-old girl from Massachusetts, the US, suffered chemical burns while playing with homemade slime. Extended exposure to borax was the cause, reports said.　 Children with atopic skin could suffer from skin irritation due to borax, according to Woo Sung-il, a professor of pediatrics at Chungbuk National University. Alternative recipes using saline solution, laundry detergent, shampoo and liquid starch are also available. 　 An inspection of 18 different types of clay and slime available on the market found no harmful elements, said an official at the Korea Consumer Agency. “(But) that does not ensure the safety of every product out there,” the official added. 　 By Rumy Doo ()",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU as a celebrity who contributed to the slime trend by posting videos of herself playing with slime on social media.

Friday’s “2017 Summer Swag” concert (“Soaking Wet Show” in Korean) was over three hours of pure madness and fun that had the 25,000 fans soaked to the skin and jumping with excitement. The show was part one of a two-day extravaganza at Jamsil Olympic Stadium in Seoul, in which the crowd was sprayed with water during highlights of the concert to beat the sweltering summer heat and humidity. “Everyone back stage was telling me. Unbelievable crowd tonight, they’re totally crazy. Thank you so much,” Psy told the delighted, screaming fans during the concert. He was not exaggerating. The “Gangnam Style” star blew them away, deploying 150 tons of water, 1,600 LED tiles and 1,500 fireworks to keep the crowd buzzing. Sprinklers that were all over stadium were intense enough to make reporters in the press seats, who were told that they would be safe from a soaking, move backwards to save their laptops. Psy kicked off the night with his 2017 release “I Luv It,” and fans immediately got on their feet, bouncing along to at the electro-house hit. He followed with a rock remix version of his old classics “Champion” and “Entertainer.” “My dear if you want it, anywhere in the world is a stage,” sang Psy as sprinklers showered the fans with water. He then gave the audience a chance to calm down with ballad “In My Eye,” or so it seemed. “I’ve noticed that the people in the second floor sat down as soon as the ballad song started. What was that about?” the pop star said jokingly, as the eager fans on the seating areas once again complied with his tacit command by immediately jumping to their feet. Catering to his old fans, there was also time to go retro as he performed “Bird” -- a title track of his 2001 debut album that earned him his reputation as a “bizarre singer” -- with his trademark bird dance. After singing “Gentleman,” he announced that he would do something he normally doesn’t do: Sing a song for couples at his concert. Instead of galloping on stage, Psy calmly sit down on a chair and began to sing “What Would It Have Been Like” -- a bittersweet ballad about a couple reminiscing on their time together -- when suddenly IU appeared on the stage to complete the duet. She added sweetness on top of the heated show by singing melancholy ballad “Through the Night” and upbeat dance pop “Good Day.” After claiming the stage for himself once again, Psy presented hits like “Right Now,” teary “Father” and “It’s Art,” giving the audience no time to dry themselves and soaking them in water. Zion.T, another guest of the show, briefly broke the parade of high-energy tunes by soothing the audience with his sweet vocals in “Eat” and “Yanghwa BRDG.” But it was during “Dream” when something truly special happened after the singer rolled out “New Face,” “Daddy” and “We Are the One.” The sprinklers sprayed water -- this time not at the audience but on stage -- in a circular form on which image of late veteran rocker Shin Hae-chul appeared. Shin’s face and his words “Maybe life is just a long dream” acted as a tribute for the Korean’s legendary musician, who was Psy’s longtime friend. The intro for Psy’s last song of the concert got the audience pumped up even before the famous line “Oppan Gangnam Style” was leashed out. Although the 2012 smash hit’s music video is no longer the most-watched video on YouTube, the song was never too old for fans, as they head-banged and horse-danced to the tunes with the “Gangnam Style” star. Night had wrapped up, but nobody seemed eager to leave. Psy, of course, teased crowds there was more to come and urged the screaming fans to crank up to volume. Amid their deafening screams, “DJ Psy” appeared on the stage to play and perform a medley of fan favorite dance songs of the ’90s. “Someday, we will meet again,” Psy sang in a 1993 Korean pop classic “Someday,” but the fans were not ready to say goodbye yet. “Out of all the concerts I’ve done, this is the lowest rate of fans going home!” Psy said with relish as he prepared for the final run. After a medley of old-school Korean rock and 1980 classic “As Time Goes By,” Psy saluted the crowd one last time with a full version of “Champion” that ended the night on a high note. Psy first introduced “Swag Show,” which later became one of his must-see-shows, in 2011 and performed it again in 2012, but hadn’t revived it until this year. Psy opened the 2017 “Swag Show” tour with a Busan concert on July 29, and will continue with concerts on Aug. 11 in Daejeon, Aug. 19 in Daegu and Aug. 26 in Gwangju.

Kakao Games on Tuesday launched “Onmyoji for Kakao,” the localized version of the hit Chinese mobile RPG, via the Google Play store and Apple App Store in Korea. Developed by Chinese game developer NetEase, “Onmyoji” is a turn-based mobile RPG that has racked up more than 2 million downloads worldwide. It is the most highly anticipated mobile title to be released by Kakao’s game publishing unit this year. In “Onmyoji,” a Japanese term for a sorcerer in the Heian period of Japan, players fight evil spirits and monsters by collecting and maneuvering various “shikigami,” or spirits that aid the sorcerer. For the Korean launch of “Onmyoji,” Kakao said it took great care to localize the game for Korean players, employing more than 40 Korean voice actors as well as designating popular Korean singer IU as its marketing model. “When we think of ghosts or spirits, we typically think of expelling them. However, ‘Onmyoji’ is a game that requires players to strategically maneuver spirits to their advantage, offering a new, interesting twist,” said Kakao Games CEO Namkoong Whon during a press conference in Seoul in June. “‘Onmyoji’ is a game that will satisfy not only those who are already fans of RPGs but also new players interested in checking out the mobile RPG genre. We hope to offer players top-notch services so that ‘Onmyoji’ can become a game enjoyed by many,” he added. Currently, NCSoft’s “Lineage M” and Netmarble Games’ “Lineage II: Revolution” are the two most profitable mobile games in Korea.

The unidentified person had posted a photo of a wrist and a knife, saying he or she would violently murder Mina if she did not mutilate her supposed boyfriend. It was later revealed to have been a practical joke of extremely poor taste. But JYP Entertainment said there will be ”no mercy” for the perpetrator and vowed legal action in what is the latest in a long line of crimes against Korea’s idol singers.  K-pop‘s biggest stars have been threatened before. In April, IU said she planned to pursue legal actions against a local YouTuber for sexual harassment. The YouTuber in question made sexual comments about the female singer, comparing her to his dog in the videos. IU’s agency Fave Entertainment pledged “strong response without mercy.” The offenders most often offer the excuse that they were merely joking. The offender in the IU case said he was a fan and the comments had been taken out of context. His words and supposed apology, however, were muddled by a more recent video of him licking IU’s photo attached to a liquor bottle. The person who threatened Mina also posted an apology and said the disturbing post was made “just to become popular” online, and that he or she had not regarded the fear it would cause the victim. In a 2006 ruling, the Supreme Court clarified that the perpetrator’s actual intent or carrying out of the threat was not necessary to constitute a threat. This means that it is possible for the aforementioned internet user to be convicted regardless of whether or not he or she had actually intended to harm Mina. Making threats is punishable by up to three years in prison or 5 million won ($4,440) in fines, according to Korean law. Sometimes a death threat goes beyond simple internet trolling. In March, an unidentified person claimed he or she would shoot Jimin of boy band BTS to death during the band’s concert in California, along with a detailed layout of the seats and a picture of a gun. Although nothing happened at the venue, the incident had BTS and fans alike on edge. Later in the month, a man was caught secretly videotaping Yerin of K-pop group GFriend during a fan meeting. Unlike in the past when singers and their agencies attempted to address such issues quietly -- due to concerns about their public image -- more celebrities are now taking firm stances against ill-intended and often illegal actions against them. Group Apink’s Plan A Entertainment agency last month said it had filed criminal charges against internet users who posted malicious comments about member Son Na-eun. Plan A said Apink will no longer put up with such slander “because they are celebrities,” and filed charges against commenters as a “severe warning to those who insult others without an iota of guilt.” By Yoon Min-sik()",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU in the context of her taking legal action against a YouTuber for sexual harassment, which relates to her public image as a female singer.

You are witnessing the first-ever concert by ‘the human Kwon Ji-yong’,” the frontman of Big Bang screamed at 40,000 fans after opening his set at the “2017 Concert: Act III, M.O.T.T.E” on Saturday at Sangam World Cup Stadium in Seoul with his first solo hit “Heartbreaker” and then moving onto “Breathe” and “A Boy.” G-Dragon’s approach to his third concert as a solo artist was simple. After spending a majority of his life in the limelight, the Korean superstar wanted to reflect on his true self and show audience a more private side of 30-year-old Kwon Ji-yong, G-Dragon’s non-stage persona. “Standing in front of you as ‘G-Dragon’ for so long made me wonder what my real self would look like. I’ve suffered from so much physical and mental distress preparing for the latest album, but it gave me a chance to look back at myself,” the artist said. G-Dragon’s new EP, released Thursday, bears his real name as the title as if to explore his persona without his celebrity status. Although G-Dragon did not directly address the marijuana controversy surrounding his fellow member T.O.P, he made a joke that the concert was within an inch from not happening. A sea of fans welcomed the artist’s honest confession by screaming and waving crown-shaped glow sticks in the group’s signature color yellow. Before ramping up the audience, G-Dragon didn’t forget to warn fans about the red-soaked stage that portrayed a “mother’s womb,” the early stages of life before being covered in fame, glory and riches. Full of swag and energy, G-Dragon galloped on to show his old hits such as “But I Love You,” “One of a Kind,” “R.O.D,” “The Leaders” and “Black.” During a performance of “Obsession,” a female fan jumped onto the stage and grabbed G-Dragon, but the artist smoothed out the interruption by continuing with his performance until she was escorted out. There were plenty of other pleasant surprises to the already heated stage. The audience’s cheers grew louder when singer IU took to the stage to perform her hit “Palette” with G-Dragon, who had featured in the song’s rapping. After the performance that marked their first on-stage duet for the song, the audience was able watch them having small talk. G-Dragon shared that he had received a fridge full of bottles of soju wrapped with banners of his face, as a gift from IU after he worked on “Palette.” “It was enough to drink until I enlist in the army. I still feel dizzy,” G-Dragon said. IU wittily replied that he would have to drink them up before he enters the army next year. The two wrapped up the collaboration by singing G-Dragon’s “Missing You” together. In line with the theme, the concert also featured heartfelt interviews with G-Dragon’s acquaintances about what kind of person he was. A screened video showed band mates Daesung and Taeyang, label mates Psy and CL, his celebrity friends and staff members sharing their thoughts on G-Dragon. The video also showed a rare scene of the artist’s father supporting his son with a message that Kwon was the best son in the world. After performing tracks from his new EP including “Superstar,” “Intro. Middle Fingers-up” and “Bullshit” in a row, G-Dragon chugged some water, panted for breath, picked up the microphone and finally said, “Now I’m running out of energy.” But he kept on sharing his earnest thoughts about what this concert truly meant. “Being a singer has always been a dream from my childhood, but now that I have run toward this goal for so long, I feel like I’m living in a dream. It feels so good, but I sometimes lose track of what is real and what is a dream. So I’m trying to get back to how I was in the beginning,” he said. He also joked by asking fans if they would still welcome 32-year-old G-Dragon when he returns from his military duty that will begin next year. The crowd gave its answer by cheering even before he finished his words. With thunderous requests for an encore, he wrapped up the concert with his classic hits “This Love,” “Crooked” and the new album’s lead track “Untitled 2014,” in which he crooned about a past romance. Saturday’s Seoul concert marked the beginning of his tour across 19 cities around the world, including Macau, Singapore, Bangkok, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, New York, Sydney, Osaka and Tokyo.

IU’s success on the Billboard chart was due in part to her strategy of releasing the album on global release day, which ensured her a full week of sales that was applied in the charts.

Following is the first article in a three-part series that examines the impact of the unofficial hallyu ban on the Korean entertainment industry. --Ed. While Beijing has reportedly been banning Korean content within China since last August, the unstoppable flow of the Korean Wave, or Hallyu, seems to be seeping into the country through online channels. On a greater scale, drama production companies and Korean celebrities have incurred considerable losses due to China’s restrictions. Approval to air the much-anticipated TV series “Saimdang, Memoir of Colors” in China is still pending, while the series has already begun airing in Korea. Actor Song Joong-ki’s voice was removed from a TV advertisement in China, while actress Yoo In-na left the cast of Chinese drama series “Love Through a Millennium 2.” But it seems the unofficial circulation of content has proven less easy to control. Though unable to air on Chinese television, pirated files of the hit series “Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,” which aired only on Korean television from Dec. 2, 2016 to Jan. 21, complete with Chinese subtitles, are circulating the internet, according to reports. Clips of “The Legend of the Blue Sea,” another popular TV drama that aired only in Korea after the reported ban, are also being shared, while illegal streaming sites bearing the shows have popped up. No numbers are available on the views or downloads via these underground channels, but other visible figures attest to the unrelenting spread of Korean content. Gong Yoo, who starred in “Guardian,” became the most searched personality on Chinese social media network Weibo on Jan. 22 and 23. The series also ranked among the most searched terms on Chinese search engine Baidu. Over 420 million posts bearing the hashtag for Gong Yoo have been uploaded on Weibo, while songs from the series’ original soundtrack have reached over 8.8 million downloads on China’s largest music platform QQ Music. Taiwan’s United Daily News reported last Wednesday that “Guardian” had been the most watched drama series during the Chinese New Year holidays. “There’s a need to probe various channels, and not simply rely on the existing mainstream channels,” said Kim Hyun-kyung, head of the China Contents Lab. Kim also pointed out that regulation of content -- both local and foreign -- is nothing new in China. Though the stars are not able to monetize their success in China while the ban is still in place, their popularity has led to a surge in tourism of areas featured in the hit drama series. Chinese tourists have been flooding to Duksung Women’s University and to Incheon’s Jumunjin Beach, where “Guardian” was filmed, reports say. Korean celebrities’ continued popularity also showed through in “Power Star,” a list ranking the popularity of foreign celebrities within China. In January’s list, Sehun and Baekhyun of EXO and actors Kim Soo-hyun, Lee Jong-suk and Song Joong-ki ranked as the top five most popular male stars. As for female celebrities, f(x)’s Krystal, Girls’ Generation’s Yoona, solo singer IU and actresses Song Hye-kyo and Song Ji-hyo took the top spots. The reported ban additionally seems to be loosening on films coproduced by Korean and Chinese companies. “Beautiful Accident,” jointly produced by Chinese Studio Huayi Brothers and South Korean company Showbox, has been confirmed to open in Chinese theaters on March 17. Though Korean actors are not included among the cast, which features Chinese stars Chen Kun and Wang Jingchun and Taiwanese actress Gwei Lun-mei, Korean boy band EXO performs the theme song.

According to a recent report released by the Korea Creative Content Agency's (KOCCA) U.S. office, Korean TV series, particularly romantic comedies, are riding a huge wave of popularity among women in their teens to early 30s in America. The report is based on an online survey conducted by the KOCCA on 4,753 Korean drama fans in the U.S., which is double the number of respondents in the last survey conducted in 2014. The results were broken down by age, ethnicity and gender. Young internet users dominated the survey - 38.5 percent were ages 16 to 20, 21.9 percent were 20 to 25, 13.1 percent were 26 to 30 and 7.7 percent were in their early 30s, making up 73.5 percent of the total respondents. Asian viewers led the pack with 25.5 percent, trailed by 25.1 percent Hispanics, 24 percent white and 9 percent African-American. Compared to the previous survey, white fans have significantly increased, climbing to third place. Most Korean drama fans, 95.1 percent of them, used online streaming services to watch subtitled series. DramaFever turned out to be the most popular platform with 63.9 percent, followed by Viki with 19.1 percent and Netflix and YouTube each recording 2.8 percent. More than half of the respondents -- 59.8 percent -- said they have been watching Korean dramas for more than three years, while 13.7 percent said it had only been two to three years and 13.65 percent one to two years. The study reflects Korean dramas' ongoing popularity, racking up 87.1 percent of avid fans who have been watching for more than a year. When it came to genre, romantic comedies were by far the most preferred recording a whopping 72 percent. Melodrama lovers came in second with 11.7 percent, trailed by historical dramas recording 9.9 percent and crime or action with 9.2 percent. The most enjoyed dramas reflected the participants' taste. The top five dramas among U.S. viewers were romantic comedies, with ""Descendants of the Sun,"" at the top, followed by ""Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo,"" ""Cinderella and Four Knights"" and ""Oh My Venus."" Meanwhile, the most famous actors were, in order, Lee Min-ho, Lee Joon-gi, Lee Jong-suk, Song Joong-ki and Ji Chang-wook. Among actresses, Park Shin-hye received the most votes, with Kong Hyo-jin ranked second and IU, Song Hye-gyo and Hwang Jung-eum rounding out the top five. ""The greatest attraction of Korean dramas is in the creative, well-structured story plot,"" said Kim Cheol-min, head of KOCCA's U.S. office.

With all these stars taking time out from their hectic schedules, one question needs to be answered -- where do we draw the line? In a span of three weeks, a member of mega hallyu boy band EXO fainted at Incheon airport, a Crayon Pop starlet suspended all her music activities due to anxiety, and a member of the newly debuted WINNER halted the group’s new album endeavors in order to tend to his “psychological issues.” On Oct. 11, EXO member Lay, along with the rest of his group members, were at the Incheon International Airport getting ready to board their flight to Japan when the K-pop idol suddenly collapsed. Those who saw the incident occur at the airport said that Lay remained unconscious as he was transferred to a hospital. After being rushed to the hospital, the K-pop star’s agency released an official statement saying, “Lay momentarily lost consciousness due to a lack of sleep. Thankfully, the doctor said he will make a full recovery after he gets some rest.” However, the incident led to a massive online outrage by dedicated EXO fans who bashed and lashed out against the entertainment agency for overworking the idols to the point of causing damage to the young entertainers’ health. Following the incident, Lay later went to urge fans not to blame S.M. Entertainment for the incident. “The fainting was my fault, please don’t curse out my fellow company colleagues,” he said in a press conference for his upcoming Chinese drama “The Mystic Nine,” eight days after the incident occurred. “The schedule arrangements were all mostly my choice. I’m the type of person who doesn’t like admitting defeat, so I always try to do everything I can. The agency respects my thoughts.” However, this is not the first time the K-pop star has lost consciousness. A similar incident occurred last May during filming for a Chinese variety show. It was concluded that Lay once again passed out due to exhaustion and fatigue. Earlier this month, both Crayon Pop member Soyul and WINNER member Nam Tae-hyun announced they were halting all of their public appearances and recording sessions. On Oct. 12, YG Entertainment announced that Nam will be suspending his role as a member of the popular new boy band WINNER indefinitely, claiming the young singer is currently seeking treatment for “mental health issues.” Although the agency did not specify exactly what sort of health issues Nam has been diagnosed with, they claimed that his issues were something that he had been dealing with since his days as a trainee, adding that his condition has “taken a turn for the worse.” It has been reported that the singer has moved out of his dorm room at the agency and is back living with his mother and is receiving treatment for his illness. In the case of Soyul, a representative of Crayon Pop’s managing agency stated that she would be suspending all group activities for the foreseeable future as the singer was recently diagnosed with having an anxiety disorder. “Her conditions are worse than expected,” the agency stated, noting that for the time being, Crayon Pop would be continuing as a four-member act. It is certainly no secret in Korea that the training process to debut as a K-pop star is no quick or simple venture. Often referred to as music “boot camp,” K-pop training among some of the nation’s biggest talent agencies is intense, to say the least. And with only a fraction of trainees able to become K-pop stars, the atmosphere among trainees can be fiercely competitive and cutthroat. With popular K-pop reality shows such as “WIN: Who Is Next?” and “Sixteen,” the public eye has been given a rare behind-the-scenes glance at the extreme late hours, stressful pressure and sheer competitive nature of the local music industry. Many ex-K-pop trainees go on to share their various experiences online through various blog postings such as “Confessions of an EX-SM Trainee” and “K-pop Secrets!,” further shedding more light on all the gritty, cut-throat reality of life as a K-pop trainee. “We had all begun to work extremely hard. Education turned out to be our last priority and making an impression on the reps, staff and CEO was (the) first priority,” wrote one former Korean-American ex-YG trainee. “This was a terrible time for me. Friends that I had made were slowly turning to rivals.” “We all began to battle each other and whatnot. I have to say that YG is definitely a serious agency, as in like the competition is dead on, there is no time for laughing and fooling around,” he continued. “Being in an agency that focused mainly on talent made things extremely difficult.” In the past, Girls’ Generation member YoonA went public about her ongoing battles with depression, as well as other famous stars including Park Bom of 2NE1 and Hee-chul of Super Junior, Epik High’s Tablo, who all claim to suffer from depression. Singer-songwriter IU has also gone public with her struggles with bulimia, while f(x)’s Amber, SHINee’s Jong-hyun and MBLAQ’s Lee Joon have all been diagnosed with insomnia.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/988126,[FEATURE] Tackling body shaming in South Korea,2016-06-14,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2016/06/14/20160614001437_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Alina Shamsutdinova thinks she can’t dress up to her potential in South Korea. The 23-year-old Kazakhstani arrived in Seoul in 2011, as an international student, in hopes to learn about the country of her ethnic origin. Born to third-generation ethnic Koreans in Kazakhstan, she grew up thinking she was beautiful, feeling confident and comfortable in her skin. 　Yet things started to change when she realized some people in Korea didn’t see her the way she saw herself. “Among the things I heard was ‘It’s okay to be ugly, but being fat is unforgivable,’” she said in an interview with The Korea Herald. 　“Another was ‘You’re really lucky that you have a pretty face. Otherwise you would never be able to have a boyfriend.’” 　While she has always considered herself a confident person, Shamsutdinova said a part of her struggled with her self-image during her stay in Korea. She was often told by Koreans that she should lose weight. Most local clothing stores didn’t have any items available in her size.  　When she lost some 10 kilograms by fasting in 2014 -- she only drank water and milk for a week -- she was told by hear Korean acquaintance that she should lose more. Throughout that week, she felt dizzy and weak. Since then, she’s made numerous attempts to lose weight after gaining it back again -- until she recently decided to solely lose weight to be healthier. 　“I think I just tried to follow what others told me, or what the society wants,” Shamsutdinova said on her previous tries to lose weight to look slimmer. “I was young and I thought that was right. I felt that this way I was working on myself when the work should’ve been done from the inside first.” 　Lookism and eating disorders  　While there aren’t a lot of studies available on body shaming in Korea, statistics show that a significant number of Korean women are struggling with their body image and eating disorders. 　In a 2013 study by Samyook University that surveyed 154 female university students in the normal weight range -- meaning their body mass index was from 18-23 -- almost 95 percent of them said they were unhappy with their bodies. Among them, 61.1 percent said they felt the need to lose weight in order to look more attractive. 　Among some 1,796 Koreans who sought medical treatment for bulimia from 2008-2013, almost 94 percent of them were women. Also, women in their 20s and 30s accounted for 66.5 percent of all patients. A number of K-pop stars and celebrities, including IU and Jang Na-ra, have openly admitted that they’ve experienced the eating disorder, which involves binge eating often followed by frantic efforts to avoid gaining weight. And many may be suffering in silence, as statistics released by the National Health Insurance Service do not include those who may have been bulimic, but did not seek professional help. 　Meanwhile, a study last year by Soon Chun Hyang University, which monitored South Korea’s public broadcasters for six months, found that body shaming of plus-size women was prevalent on Korean TV. 　For example, an episode of “Hello,” a talk show on KBS2, featured the story of a young woman who belittled her younger sister, whom she called “fat and short,” when the sibling said she was confident about her own body and thought that she could date anyone she wanted. 　The younger sister said on the show: “My sister said I looked ‘disgusting’ when I wore shorts.” 　The study also found that many TV producers didn’t see the connection between the nation’s prevalent lookism and gender disparity. The researchers asked six TV producers to rate the importance of combating lookism and body shaming on television on a scale of zero to five -- five being the most important. The producers on average rated it 1.5 out of five. 　“I think lookism applies to both men and women (on TV),” one of the surveyed producers told researchers for the study. “I don’t think lookism is part of the gender inequality issue.” 　Body shaming in the education system  　Won Yoo-ri was 17 when she returned to Seoul in 2010 to attend university here after living overseas for 16 years. During her first months back, a middle-aged woman on the street literally gasped when she saw her wearing shorts. 　“Oh my god, when are you going to lose weight? Women must be skinny in order to find men,” the woman, whom she had never seen before, told her. 　From that day on, Won said she was body shamed left and right in Korea, from strangers to friends, classmates and even professors. One of her older classmates once told her that he’d date her if she lost 30 pounds (14 kilograms). She had never been interested in dating him. Once at a restaurant, a server told her that she should stop eating because she had eaten enough. Won also had a professor who told her she would “have it all” if she lost 10 kilograms. 　She said all of these experiences severely affected her self-esteem. 　“In the U.S., I felt that my personality was all I needed and people responded to it,” she told The Korea Herald. “But to come to a country and constantly hear a conversation turn to ‘you should lose weight’ was heartbreaking. That became my identity -- the outgoing fat girl from LA.” 　Pressured by the constant shaming, Won has made a number of efforts to lose weight since 2010. She has sought help at a weight management company. In another try, she ran 10 kilometers a day for two months in the harsh winter weather. “I even considered getting my stomach stapled,” she said. 　The whole point of losing weight was to avoid the shaming and get complimented on her looks, she said. One of her college friends also starved herself for four months -- she’d only eat half an apple and a single chicken breast a day -- to lose weight. In the process, she passed out at least four times. “(I wanted to) finally feel beautiful for once in Korea and meet the standards,” she said. “So I can move on and better myself in other aspects.” 　Ashley Hounsell, a 29-year-old American English-language teacher, has been working at a high school in Seoul for the past six years. She’s witnessed many of her current and former female students who were insecure about their body image. Every year during their health checkup, the scale would display everyone’s height and weight for the whole class to see. “I remember girls telling me they weren’t eating for the week before their school checkup,” Hounsell told The Korea Herald. “When I asked why, they told me because everyone gets to see their weight.” 　Before working at the high school, she taught younger children at a private English-language institution. There, one of her female students, who was 9 at the time, wrote in her diary that she was on a cucumber-only diet because her mother told her she was fat. 　South Korea currently does not offer any educational programs specifically on body image or self-concept for school children. 　“Our gender-equality program for school teachers includes a session about how one should not be discriminated against because of their appearance,” said Lee Myung-eun from the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family’s Gender Impact Assessment Division. 　Fat shaming and fashion industry  　In Seoul, Shamsutdinova only shops in Myeong-dong, at foreign stores such as H&M and Forever 21, because Korea’s homegrown brands simply don’t offer anything available in her size. Once, while looking at a shirt for a friend at a Korean store, a sales assistant grabbed the shirt away from her hands, without even asking. “And then she started saying (in English) ‘(too) small,’ ‘(too) small,’” she said. “I was speechless.” 　Shamsutdinova said even online shops and foreign stores in Korea often don’t have many items for plus-size women. And she’s often unhappy about those that are available -- they are often too baggy or unflattering, and don’t complement plus-size body figures, she said. “Having only a couple of stores where I can buy my clothes isn’t easy,” she said. “It feels like if you are plus size you are not allowed to look good. I can’t be as fashionable as I want to be (in Korea) even though I want to look beautiful.” 　Baek Jae-hwan, who has been running an online retailer specifically targeting plus-size women for five years, said most Koreans tend to think those who dress well are only those who are thin. His shop, www.tongkeungirl.com, is one of very few Korean online stores that features plus-size models for their clothes. One of the models is in fact Baek’s wife, who is also his business partner. 　“My wife has always had a very specific taste in clothes,” Baek told The Korea Herald. “She’s always preferred simple and modern design over something too frilly or dressy. As she couldn’t find what she wanted to wear available in her size, she wanted to find them herself. That’s how we started our business.” 　Baek said he’s received a lot of positive feedback from his customers, who also expressed their frustration over other online stores that feature skinny models when they claim to cater to plus-size women. “One’s body and its size has little to do with his or her ability to dress well. I’ve seen skinny people who dress terribly,” he said. “Being a good dresser means you just understand your body, what works the best for you. I think it’s totally possible for people with all kinds of body shapes to dress well. But I also understand that plus-size individuals have limited options to choose from. And that needs to change.” 　Bringing changes 　Earlier this year, Shamsutdinova participated in a special project called “I am Beautiful,” which featured photographs of 24 individuals who have struggled with self-image and are making efforts to love and accept themselves as they are. 　For her, discovering the existence of plus-size models worldwide, especially Tess Holliday, one of the best known body-positive activists in the U.S., and South Korea’s first plus-size model Kim Ji-yang, made a difference. She has recently accepted that it is not easy for her to lose weight and she would only go on a diet for health purposes, not to meet the beauty standards here. 　While she thinks plus-size models shouldn’t justify obesity and an unhealthy lifestyle, Shamsutdinova said the world needs to see more people like Holliday and Kim to change their views on beauty and women’s bodies. 　“Once I started seeing girls my size in the media, I definitely started to appreciate my body more and accept myself more,” she said. “(Learning about) Kim Ji-yang was just empowering. She looked beautiful. She is Asian like me even though there is a stereotype that ‘Asians are usually slim.’” 　James Turnbull, who writes on Korean feminism and popular culture at his established blog the Grand Narrative, said asking Korean TV producers to notice lookism was like “asking fish to start paying attention to the water.” 　He pointed out that Korea has the highest rate of celebrity endorsements in the world, as roughly 60 percent of all commercials here feature celebrities, as opposed to about 10 percent in most other developed nations. 　“(The South Korean government) can set an example by choosing alternative role models as representatives for its own numerous public campaigns, rather than always going for a young, thin K-pop star,” Turnbull said, when asked what Korea could do to tackle the issue of body shaming. 　Like Shamsutdinova, Won also recently decided to lose weight for her own sake and health, and said she’s never been happier. “A year ago I met my current boyfriend who happens to be Filipino-American,” she said. “Being around him and his friends reassure me and encourage me solely to, perhaps, lose weight to be healthier was my turning point. It really depends on who you surround yourself with.” 　By Claire Lee (dyc@heraldcorp.com) 　Ashley Hounsell is not her real name.

Yoo Si-jin -- as Asia’s next leading heartthrob. 　From medical dramas to period pieces, an ambitious roster of TV shows starring some of the country’s most in-demand male leads are scheduled to launch in the coming months. 　First up is the SBS show “Doctors,” featuring actor Kim Rae-won as a high school biology teacher haunted by his former medical internship, during which he accidentally caused the death of a patient. After meeting student Hye-jung, played by wildly popular actress Park Shin-hye, he is motivated to return to the hospital and become a neurosurgeon. The 35-year-old actor, who previously played a greed-driven prosecutor in the 2014 series “Punch,” will return as a warm character this time round.　 　The KBS2 series “Uncontrollably Fond,” scheduled for a July 6 start, will feature model-turned-actor Kim Woo-bin, 26, in a heart-tickling romance with K-pop starlet and actress Suzy. The show will mark Kim’s first time on the small screen since his role as a bad-boy millionaire in 2013’s “The Heirs,” and feature him as an equally tantalizing tease. 　On July 20, the MBC series “W” will kick off with actor Lee Jong-suk, 26, as the male lead. Lee, who formerly played a tortured genius reporter in the 2014 “Pinocchio,” will return once more as a character with uncommon intelligence -- a mystery-shrouded entrepreneur who previously won an Olympic gold medal, then switches careers to learn computer engineering and founds his own venture company, becoming massively wealthy. 　The later months will see three period pieces. “Moonlight Drawn by Clouds,” scheduled to air Aug. 15 on KBS2, will star “Reply 1988” actor Park Bo-gum, 22, as a young prince in a story of teenage heartache set in the Joseon era. Kim Yoo-jung will play his female love interest who enters the palace disguised as a eunuch. 　The SBS show “Scarlet Heart: Ryeo,” set for an Aug. 29 launch, will detail the story of Taejo Wang Geon, who founded the Goryeo Dynasty in 877. The role of the cold and measured king will be played by Lee Joon-gi, 34, who is known for performances in numerous period pieces including 2005 film “King and the Clown” and last year’s TV series “Scholar Who Walks the Night.” The female lead role will be taken up by singer-actress IU. 　 　Actor Song Seung-heon, 39, is lined up to star in “Saimdang, the Herstory” alongside “Jewel of the Palace” star Lee Young-ae as a famed artist and principled royal standing against the corruption of the Joseon era.

However the creative minds of Digipedi are best known for their work in the K-pop industry. 　Since their debut music video with hip-hop megastars Dynamic Duo nearly a decade ago, Seong and Park have worked alongside nearly every other big name in the K-pop industry, including Psy, Epik High, SHINee, Orange Caramel, IU, Kara, Zion.T, Busker Busker and EXID. 　Last year alone, the duo was behind more than 15 K-pop music videos including Psy’s highly anticipated “Daddy” and “Napal Baji,” along with Infinite’s “Bad,” Beenzino’s “Break,” Mamamoo’s “Ahh Oop!” and Seventeen and Ailee’s “Q&A.” Digipedi’s music videos have garnered a combined total of more than 205 million views on YouTube. 　“When it came to Psy’s latest music videos, we know he’s this massive hallyu star and it’s not just local fans that are excited and waiting for his new videos. He has fans all across the world watching,” Seong said, during an interview with The Korea Herald at a cafe in Gangnam last week. 　“And although this may have added to our nerves a bit, I don’t think it changed our approach to the production at all,” Park added. “Especially when you compare the nerves and the burden that was on Psy’s shoulders. We did not feel the pressure. Colorful, humorous and memorable were still our main objectives and I think we achieved that.” 　One of the duo’s most famous music videos to date, is without a doubt K-pop girl group Orange Caramel’s 2014 music video “Catallena.” 　In what is still widely considered an unexpected and bizarre concept, the music video features the girl group’s members dressed like pieces of sushi. But the directors’ out-of-the-box oddball thinking paid off. 　Within the first 24 hours of the music video’s release in March 2014, the clip received more than one million views on YouTube. Even those who were not fans of Orange Caramel would have at least seen or heard about the sushi-inspired K-pop video. 　“I think over the year we’ve definitely developed this reputation for coming up with, I guess you could call it unusual concepts and ideas for our videos,” said Park. “I think a lot of people recognized and got a taste of that with Orange Caramel’s ‘Catallena,’ but for us, it is not all about the shock value. I would say that we do really place at lot of emphasis on color. Colors that are eye-popping make for more memorable and stimulating productions.” 　“When it comes to our creative process, we still consider ourselves artists. And while we do receive some input from a group’s managing agency, for the most part, we rely on our own imaginations,” Seong added. “We don’t really have any specific formulas. We sit and listen to the track and from there, inspiration hits and ideas just begin to flow.” 　While their creative process seems arbitrary, Digipedi still manages to crank out an average of three music video productions every month and shows no signs of slowing down. 　The producers recently expanded their megastar client list to include Conan O’Brien, one of the most influential and popular late-night talk show hosts in the U.S. 　While in Korea last month, the American talk-show host took part in a hush-hush collaborative music video project with JYP Entertainment’s head Park Jin-young. Although no details have been made public, Park and Seong confirmed that they were behind the filming of the upcoming video. 　“We can’t release any details, but we did film a music video with Conan O’Brien,” Seong said. 　With hallyu continuing to advance across the globe, Digipedi admits that the possible reactions of international fans always cross their minds now when working on a new project. 　“When we first started our music video careers, hallyu was unheard of and we never really thought about producing something that could translate well on an international level,” said Seong. “Now every time we create a new video, there’s always that thought of hallyu in the back of my mind. I’m not saying that we consider ourselves as having some kind of responsibility to only create ‘foreigner-friendly’ videos, but for sure K-pop’s global popularity is always something we try to keep in mind when producing.” 　“It’s a bit unreal to see our videos on YouTube with comments from people from all over the world and in so many different languages – granted I have no idea what most of them are saying,” Park added with a smile. “But I really think hallyu has changed the game for K-pop and the Korean entertainment industry in a fantastic way.” By Julie Jackson ()",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU as one of the artists Digipedi has worked with, but it does not focus on her specifically or discuss her work as a singer, songwriter, or actress.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/814191,Kakao stands to dominate K-pop market with Loen acquisition,2016-01-12,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2016/01/12/20160112001730_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"A seismic shift may be in store for the local entertainment industry after tech giant Kakao’s entrance to the market, upon its acquisition of Loen Entertainment, the operator of MelOn, Korea’s top music-streaming service. 　The big buy, which gives the maker of mobile messenger KakaoTalk a 76.4 percent stake in Loen worth 1.87 trillion won ($1.55 billion) later this month, could open a greater platform for the company to create new music services, on top of access to Loen’s plethora of entertainment content.  　MelOn is already the country’s No. 1 online music-streaming site, controlling about 50 percent of the market with roughly 28 million subscribers, including approximately 3.6 million paid subscribers. The acquisition announced Monday by Kakao, which has roughly 150 million users worldwide, is projected to further increase MelOn’s music streaming monopoly. 　“Once MelOn, which has a market share of more than 50 percent, combines with Kakao’s platform and capital, its monopoly in the music streaming industry will be stabilized and it would be hard for rival music sites to compete,” said one music website employee. 　The music industry here has already been strongly criticized for bifurcating the country’s music content into K-pop music and non-K-pop music, and some music insiders view the acquisition as potentially making it even more difficult for non-K-pop artists, or small-time pop music agencies, to penetrate the market with independent content. 　“When big conglomerates are in charge of distributing content and even control the production platforms of musicians, it will inevitably lead to a big shift in synergy,” a representative of a midsize entertainment agency was reported telling a local news outlet. 　“This makes it nearly impossible for a company like us to grow and establish content independently, unless we move to a big-time music label.” 　By combining forces, Kakao and MelOn are expected to ride K-pop’s popularity in the broader Asian market to further expand and strengthen Kakao’s presence overseas. 　“Music is one of the most loved content genres in the mobile era,” said Kakao CEO Jimmy Rim on Monday. “It is also incredibly powerful in that one song can set trends for an entire generation and highly influence global pop culture,” 　“By combining Kakao’s various platforms and content services and Loen’s leading music content, we expect tremendous synergy that could establish a strong foundation for global expansion,” he added, noting his vision that this new partnership with MelOn would forge the needed momentum for Kakao’s global debut. 　However, aside from dominating online streaming in Korea, Loen Entertainment is also the country’s No. 1 record distribution label and leading managing agency to a number of big-name K-pop acts, on-screen stars, writers and producers. 　The company’s Loen Tree agency is home to popular K-pop starlet IU, while its Starship Entertainment is home to music heavyweights Sistar and K.Will as well as idol boy band Boyfriend. 　Late last year Loen also became the majority shareholder of A Cube Entertainment, buying a 70 percent stake in the company. A Cube is home to Apink and singer Huhgak, and is a subsidiary of Cube Entertainment, one of the country’s biggest K-pop agencies, which manages some of the industry’s top-name acts, including 4minute and Beast. 　In 2013, Kakao made its first foray into the local music market by launching its social networking music service KakaoMusic in collaboration with Bugs Corp. -- Korea’s No. 4 music-streaming site. Following Monday’s announcement, it was revealed that that service will continue after the merger, although many industry insiders remain skeptical as to its continued operations. 　Along with its ventures in the music market, Kakao has established many platforms in the communications and entertainment fields, including KakaoTV, a video sharing platform that offers free Web dramas and video-on-demand movies and that also allows users to watch clips with friends. 　Kakao announced that the initial plan for its music industry endeavors is to fuel demand by adding to existing services and create new music services incorporating social networking platforms.

At her solo concert in Seoul on Saturday, the 22-year-old singer-songwriter performed the controversial song, “Zeze,” explaining to the audience that she “still dearly loves it.” A track on IU’s latest EP “Chat-shire,” the song is named after the boy protagonist of Portuguese novel “My Sweet Orange Tree.” Its self-written lyrics have been the target of criticism, with some critics viewing them as “hinting at pedophilia.” That the singer had described the character Zeze as “sexy” in a separate interview also became a point of debate. IU was unperturbed, however, as she sang the piece in front of around 6,000 audience members at Saturday’s concert at the Olympic Hall in Seoul, in what was to be the opening of her domestic tour. IU started off the concert with “Shoes,” from her latest mini-EP “Chat-shire,” followed by “Everyone has secrets,” “Obliviate” and “Red Queen,” leading up to “Zeze,” the fifth in the song lineup. People close to IU were present to give her emotional support. IU’s boyfriend of two years, Jang Ki-ha, along with her best friend Yoo In-na and Indie duo group 10cm’s Kwon Jung-yeol were in the crowd. The chanteuse finished off the show by thanking the audience, “As this was the first concert (for ‘Chat-shire’), we prepared hard, and there were things to overcome. I was very nervous but upon coming up to the stage, I saw your smiling faces and felt grateful. You had no worries on your shining faces and that was reassuring.” Following the two-day concert over the weekend, IU will continue on a national tour that stretches to Daegu, Busan, Gwangju and more venues through the end of the year.

At the center of the controversy is “Zeze,” a track on the young starlet’s latest album, “Chat-shire,” released last month. The song was inspired by 5-year-old boy character Zeze in the novel “My Sweet Orange Tree,” written by Brazilian author Jose Mauro de Vasconcelos. The song “Zeze,” written from the viewpoint of the orange tree, includes lyrics that some claim are sexually suggestive, such as: “Zeze, hurry and climb up the tree / kiss the leaves,” “If you hurt the tree, bad, bad,” “Take the youngest leaf here / Pick the only flower / Climb up me / Climb up me,” “You’re very naive / but certainly sly,” “You might seem transparent like a young child / but something about you is dirty” and “tomorrow night, will you come see me again.” Explaining the song, the 22-year-old singer has said: “Zeze is innocent but cruel in some aspects. He is a character with many paradoxes, which is why I felt he was charming and sexy.” In the novel, which is featured in the Korean sixth-grade curriculum, Zeze is an imaginative but misunderstood 5-year-old boy who is physically abused by his family and comes to befriend an orange tree. Korean commenters online as well as critics, academics and artists are largely divided over the issue, with some defending the young starlet’s freedom of artistic expression and others claiming a line must be drawn when it comes to literary interpretation suggestive of pedophilia. Dongnyok Publishing Co., the publisher of the Korean translation of “My Sweet Orange Tree,” called IU’s interpretation of the child character “wrong” and raised concerns over a young character being portrayed as a sexual being. “It is a great pity that (IU) considered the 5-year-old Zeze to be a sexual subject. Freedom of expression has to be achieved in light of public sympathy,” the company said in a statement. Some, such as writer and critic Heo Ji-woong, defended IU’s right to freedom of interpretation and secondary creation. “It is not right for a publishing company to offer a strict guideline for literary interpretation,” he wrote on his social media handle, adding, “all literature is continually being newly discovered atop the interpreter’s freedom and capacity.” Novelist Kim Jae-won countered the argument, saying “Taboos exist even in art,” while others pointed out the lack of literary logic in connecting the character Zeze with sexuality. IU has since issued an official apology through social media, saying: “I swear I did not write the lyrics with the intent to sexualize a 5-year-old child.” She further apologized for using the word “sexy” in the context of children, and asked that the character in the song be thought of as inspired by, but independent from, the character in the novel. Even after the apology, outrage persists among some online commenters, who have started a public petition to dispose of all copies of the album. “IU has herself been sexually objectified in the pop industry. ...That does not give her the excuse to sell the sexuality of ... children, who are even weaker than her,” a Facebook user surnamed Han wrote in a lengthy post. Another user, surnamed Kim, pointed to the irony in the public’s willingness to “consume IU’s Lolita-like image” while blasting her for “identifying with” a precocious young character.　 By Rumy Doo ()",iu,5.0,"The article specifically mentions IU (아이유) and focuses on her work as a singer-songwriter, addressing controversy related to her song lyrics.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/718437,Is the Korean digital music market pushing out artists?,2015-10-29,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2015/10/29/20151029001605_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Dependence on platforms, charts hindering new songs from reaching listeners This is the second in a two-part series examining Korea’s digital music industry. – Ed. If it’s hard to name more than a few Korean artists who are currently active and not idol stars, K-pop ballad singers or TV discoveries, it’s not because they don’t exist. “There are only two genres in today’s Korean music,” said Shin Dae-chul, head of the Barun Music Cooperative, at a forum in Seoul. “Idol music, non-idol music. The rest is meaningless. ... (The current digital music system) has naturally pushed out consumers in their 40s and 50s, and musicians as well. They can’t work in this system.” Musical artists agree with this. “It’s definitely not a market that’s structured to be favorable for artists,” said the vocalist of an indie rock band, speaking to The Korea Herald on condition of anonymity. The singer said her band, as well as other bands she has spoken to, has had bad experiences with distributors and platforms that were taking artists for granted. “It would be really difficult to get someone on the phone to change incorrect information about us on the site, or to remove our songs altogether.” For a while, she said that her band even considered not distributing their songs in Korea at all. “We don’t even make that much off streaming,” she said, noting that music streaming platforms take 40 percent of the streaming revenue. “We said, we don’t need it, take the songs down.” But there are not many other options for indie artists to make an income, she said. She and industry insiders like Lee Youn-hyuk, head of secretariat at the Record Label Industry Association of Korea, said the way digital music is consumed in Korea is a root cause of why only certain artists can succeed in the digital music environment. “Most people consume music by listening to the top 100 songs on the charts, although that’s difficult to prove quantitatively because every music streaming service is different,” Lee told The Korea Herald in a telephone interview. “Since most people don’t look for songs outside of the top 100, the charts become very conservative. The same songs are consumed over and over again, making it hard for new songs to break in.” As of Thursday, five of the top 10 songs on the real-time charts from Melon, the largest digital music servic provider, are from one album -- IU’s “Chat-Shire,” which was released Oct. 23. Two other songs are from idol stars -- Taeyeon’s “I,” released Oct. 7, and f(x)’s “4 Walls,” released Oct. 27. One song is from a drama soundtrack, and the remaining two are from Lim Chang-jung and Zion.T, both of whom are known for their megahits with each new album. The reason for this pattern of consumption has a lot to do with price. Digital music platforms in Korea all offer unlimited streaming packages at about 6,000 won ($5.25) a month. It is only another 2,000 won to 3,000 won to add unlimited mobile downloads for music. At this price point, consumers do not feel the need to carefully curate their listening choices. “Labels will often talk about switching between distributors in order to gain an edge with platforms, either through playlist recommendations or special mentions,” said Lee. “But even that’s only for artists and labels that have a bit of pull. For new faces, it’s a nonstarter.” While acknowledging the difficulties presented by the current digital market situation, both the anonymous vocalist and Lee noted the artists could also do more on their end to improve the situation. “We write and produce all of our own music, meaning that we sign our own contracts for distribution,” said the vocalist. “That’s the only reason we know all these problems with distribution rights. Most artists don’t know about this kind of stuff.” Lee added that artists in Korea need to study up. “A lot of indie artists abroad do the promotional work themselves. They hire someone to do that for them only when they’ve reached a point in their music where both they and their label can make income together,” Lee said. “You can’t eliminate market economics from music, especially pop music.” “Artists have to know how their music will reach and be consumed by listeners. If they can’t figure it out themselves, they need to know how to find good partners that can help them,” he added.　 By Won Ho-jung ()",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU in the context of her album ""Chat-Shire"" dominating the charts, which relates to her work as a singer and songwriter.

Dubbed “the most anticipated show of 2015” by industry insiders, the new KBS drama will take us behind the scenes, revealing all the craze of overnight editing and endless meetings that go into producing variety shows, and promises light-hearted fun and laughter on the way. The drama marks actor Kim Soo-hyun’s return to television after a one-year hiatus since the mega-hit drama “My Love from the Star.” In complete contrast to his role as charismatic alien Do Min-joon, this time, Kim will play a principled, book-smart rookie producer named Baek Seung-chan, who is painfully inarticulate, clumsy and not at all street-smart. “Everybody was a rookie at some point in their lives,” said Kim in a press conference in Seoul on Monday. “So my goal is to let people relate to my character and remember that time.” “He’s entirely clueless,” said Kim on his endearingly awkward role. “But he tries so earnestly not to be clueless, but that ends up irritating his superiors even more.” In the show, Baek is constantly berated by Tak Ye-jin, the temperamental producer of popular music program “Music Bank.” Played by actress Gong Hyo-jin, Tak gives rookie employees a hard time with her straightforwardness, but is ultimately “human,” said Gong, and does her fair share of comical blundering. “It’s the most aggravated, neurotic role I’ve ever taken on,” said the actress famed for sparking romantic chemistry in dramas like “Pasta” and “It’s Okay, That’s Love.” “In the first episode, there are almost no scenes of (Ye-jin) smiling. She’s dissatisfied with everything, always telling people what to do ... but she’s imperfect and human, and writer Park Ji-eun makes her so charming.” Alongside Gong’s character will be the hot-headed but soft-hearted variety show producer Ra Joon-mo, played by actor Cha Tae-hyun, who is well-loved for comic roles in box-office hits such as “My Sassy Girl” (2001). It was easy for the seasoned actor to imagine himself on the other side of the scene. “I’ve done so many things during the course of my career in the entertainment industry ― I’ve been a singer, an emcee, I’ve done radio and variety shows. I realized I’ve absorbed so much from all these experiences without even thinking about it,” said Cha. Completing the star-studded cast will be singer-actress IU, who will play the haughty pop diva Cindy ― nicknamed “ice princess” for her complete emotional command and icy demeanor. The singer said she observed and took tips from fellow singers to prepare for the role, but was also surprised at how similar the character was to her real-life self. “Everyone has that irritated, touchy side to them,” she said, explaining that she was able to relate to the character’s biting attitude. “But Cindy is not all mean. The more I study her, the more I learn that she’s an innocent soul.” IU added that she is writing a song based on the character. The drama has numerous references to real producer-directors like Na Young-seok and celebrity cameo appearances, including singer-producer and chief of JYP Entertainment Park Jin-young. Helmed by comedy and variety show producer Seo Soo-min and penned by “My Love from the Stars” writer Park Ji-eun, “The Producers” will air Fridays and Saturdays at 9:15 p.m. starting May 15 and continue for 12 episodes, with each episode lasting 70 minutes.

The controversial bill is dubbed by news media as the “IU law,” referring to popular singer-songwriter IU. The 22-year-old has been starring in Chamisul soju ads since late last year. The debate started in 2012 when a ruling party lawmaker proposed a revision to the national health promotion law to ban celebrities aged 24 or less from appearing in alcohol ads. Offenders would face up to a one-year sentence or a 10 million won ($9,180) fine. The bill gathered and was out of the public’s focus for years, until the parliamentary health and welfare committee unexpectedly decided to have it passed. The age of an adult as stated by the civil law is 19, so those who have reached the age can legally purchase and consume alcoholic beverages. But the youth act defines ‘youth’ as those aged between nine and 24. So, should the bill be enacted, young adults aged between 19 and 24 will be allowed to drink alcoholic beverages but cannot promote them in the market. Also, the revision bill would be at odds with the regulations on televised commercial deliberation, which states that those aged 19 or older can star in alcohol ads. Despite controversies, advocates of this bill claim that underaged drinking models may have a negative influence on teenage drinking and thus should be restricted. “Countries such as the U.S. and Britain already have similar bans, and they stop people aged 25 or less from starring in liquor ads,” said an aide to the ruling Saenuri Party lawmaker Rep. Lee Elisa, the initiator of the bill. But Lee’s team admitted that the corresponding overseas regulations are nonbinding and self-regulatory. Attempting to add momentum to the faltering bill, a number of conservative Christian civic groups held a rally in front of the National Assembly earlier this week, demanding quick parliamentary approval. “The frequent appearance of young adults in drinking ads may have a negative impact on teenagers, who tend to value their peers,” said an official of the Civil Solidarity on the Prevention of Addiction. Alcohol manufacturers, however, remained poised, especially as the legislation and judicial committee spoke against the idea, claiming that the effect of the ban was uncertain. The excessive restriction may also infringe on the models’ freedom of occupation, according to the committee. “Even if the law revision did take place, it will take months until actual effectuation,” said an official of Hite Jinro, the nation’s second-largest alcohol company. “Our contract with IU will end by then in any case so we have time to watch the legislative moves and decide on our next action.” Hite Jinro is the manufacturer of Chamisul soju, as well as Hite beer, which had hired figure skating star Kim Yu-na back in 2012, when she was in the disputed 19-24 age group.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3631033,2NE1 snags Billboard’s best K-pop album pick of 2014,2014-12-14,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2014/12/14/20141214000282_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"As the countdown to 2015 approaches, the assessment of the year’s best songs, albums and industry newcomers is in full swing. Rounding out the year, Billboard’s top picks of the 10 best K-pop albums of 2014 land the feisty K-pop icons of 2NE1 the crown. The ladies’ second full-length album, “Crush,” was praised for cleverly exploring hybrid genres including reggae and R&B and landed them at the No. 1 spot, beating out other much awaited K-pop heavy-weight comebacks such as Seo Taiji and Rain. The magazine referred to opening the album with its eponymous single, which is not the album’s lead track, as a sign that although the group’s sound is maturing, the ladies have not forgotten where they come from. “ ... opening the record with ‘Crush,’ with its bewitching Middle-Eastern vibe and aggressive attitude similar to their signature hit “I Am the Best” proved that the girls know where their roots lie and they’re happy to treat fans while still evolving as artists.” According to Billboard, “Crush” debuted at No. 61 on the Billboard 200, marking the highest chart position and biggest sales week for a K-pop album ever. The album was released on Feb. 27 and came nearly four years after the group’s first full-length album, “To Anyone.” In somewhat of a surprising twist, taking second place on Billboard’s stamp of the year’s best K-pop albums is a band that would not even be labeled as a K-pop act by locals. Popular indie band Nell beat out the likes of K-pop starlet IU for the No. 2 spot with the band’s latest sixth full album, “Newton’s Apple.” Coincidentally released on the exact same day as 2NE1’s album, the magazine referred to Nell’s record as the strongest Korean rock album of the year. “ ... ‘Newton’s Apple’ highlights Nell’s vocalist/chief composer Kim Jong Wan’s clever and honest songwriting skills. ... All the lyrics are wrapped in warm, lush arrangements and instrumentals that enchant the listener simply by themselves,” Billboard wrote. With IU and Seo Taiji taking the third and fourth spots, respectively, rounding out the rest of the Top 10 lists are HA:TFELT (known best as Yenny from the Wonder Girls), Taeyang of Big Bang, B.A.P., Epik High, CNBLUE and Rain’s “Rain Effect.” As for Billboard’s list of the year’s 20 best K-pop songs, Beast took the top spot with the boy band’s single, “Good Luck,” followed by Seo Taiji & IU’s “Sogyeokdong” and G-Dragon & Taeyang’s “Good Boy.” Of course, no Korean music chart would seem complete without one of cheekiest faces of K-pop. Despite his fading presence from the mainstream international spotlight this year, Psy has still managed to infiltrate the magazine’s year-end round-ups with the artist’s 2-year-old viral phenom single “Gangnam Style” being ranked at No. 14 of the year’s most streamed songs. Psy was also listed as the 15th most streamed artist of 2014, beating out global superstars Chris Brown, Eminem, One Direction and Maroon 5. By Julie Jackson ()",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU (아이유) in the context of her music, specifically ranking her album third in Billboard’s best K-pop albums of 2014 and her collaboration with Seo Taiji (""Sogyeokdong"") second in the best K-pop songs list.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3633328,[Herald Review] Seo Taiji induces ’90s nostalgia with lavish ‘Christmalowin’ return,2014-10-19,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2014/10/19/20141019000038_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Seo Taiji, one of the country’s most influential musical figures and ’90s icons, finally made his long-awaited return to the music scene with his extravagant live production of “Christmalowin,” the singer’s first concert performance in five years. In commemoration of his upcoming ninth full-length album, “Quiet Night,” Seo’s comeback show at the Jamil Sports Complex’s Olympic Stadium was anything but quiet on Saturday evening. Under the hybrid theme of both Christmas and Halloween, the concert venue offered the rare spectacle of people dressed up in Santa outfits mingling with those who chose the dark side of the spectrum, dressed like not-so-bedazzling witches and bloody creatures that looked to be inspired by “The Walking Dead.” Although the show got off to a bit of a rough beginning, with Seo not taking the stage until an hour after the concert was originally scheduled to start, as soon as the singer hit the stage and opened with the past hit single “Moai,” the crowd seemed to lose all track of time and simply reveled in his presence. After his opening song, K-pop starlet IU took to the stage for a performance of their recently released collaboration track “Sogyeokdong.” Seo followed this with a performance of another of his new singles, “Chirstmalo.win.” Including the aforementioned two new tracks, Seo performed six songs off his latest nine-track album, which is scheduled to be released in its entirety on Monday. As soon as the show began, there was no denying that the music icon kept his promise of creating a blockbuster-like concert atmosphere. Decked out with a giant Jack-o’-lantern and with candy cane-shaped figurines riddled about, the extravagant stage looked like something straight out of Tim Burton’s “The Nightmare Before Christmas.” It was evident that Seo spared no expenses for his highly anticipated comeback in a show that had no shortage of visual effects, flashing lights, beautifully timed fireworks, blazing flames and a booming sound system like none other ― the vibrations from the subwoofers actually tickled one’s skin throughout the night. In order to ensure the best sound quality for the large-scale concert performance, representatives of Seo Taiji Co. had previously revealed that they sought the expertise of famed audio technician Paul Bauman, who has worked on live shows for renowned artists such as Bob Dylan, Madonna, Radiohead, David Bowie and others. From hip-hop to hardcore rock to ballads, the 42-year-old former Seo Taiji and Boys’ leader is arguably one of the industry’s most eclectic singers, often credited as the most influential figure in the development of Korean popular culture and the K-pop genre. Aside from Seo’s new singles, the ’90s icon also took the audience back more than two decades to his Seo Taiji and Boys days, bringing back nostalgic memories of the young superstar with his baggy pants and beanie cap producing songs going up against “the man” and calling out for political and social reform. On Saturday he sang the group’s popular single “My Everything” ― the first time he has performed the song in 22 years. Near the end of the show, up-and-coming local rap stars Swings and Vasco joined Seo on stage, where the trio performed Seo Taiji and Boys’ most iconic hit singles: “Come Back Home,” “Class Idea” and “Hayeoga.” The singer capped off his epic 90-minute comeback concert with a picturesque display of fireworks and an encore performance of “Take Five.” By Julie Jackson ()",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU as a performer in Seo Taiji's concert, specifically for their collaboration track ""Sogyeokdong.""

Seo appeared on the popular KBS2 TV program “Happy Together 3” last week, giving the public a rare glimpse into his personal life as he talked about the birth of his daughter and his surprise marriage with the lesser-known actress Lee Eun-seong last year. Following the announcement of his long-awaited return to the public eye, the singer has been dominating music headlines over the past several months, publicizing random sneak tidbits of his upcoming album “Quiet Night,” and a large-scale concert performance. After his months of hinting, Seo finally unveiled both versions of “Sogyeokdong,” the prerelease singles off his soon-to-be-released ninth studio album. It was previously announced that the single would come in two versions; the first version of the track was performed and sung by popular K-pop starlet IU and was released online on Oct. 2, while the second version, sung by Seo himself, was released 10 days later on Friday. The vintage-sounding electronic pop song features the artist’s classic soft-spoken ballad vocals and in just two days, the track’s music video had racked up more than half a million views on YouTube. Seo and IU’s agencies said they had been secretly working on the track for months, trying to keep fans in the dark as much as possible about the collaborative project. IU’s version went on to top all nine major online music charts shortly after its release, while Seo’s release marks a comeback after a five-year hiatus. The 42-year-old former Seo Taiji and Boys’ leader, who is often credited as one of the most influential figures in the development of Korean popular culture and the K-pop genre, is now gearing up for what is expected by many to be one of the biggest K-pop concerts of the year. Seo’s concert will be held in Seoul on Oct. 18 at the Jamsil Sports Complex’s Olympic Stadium. The show is said to be a Christmas-Halloween theme fusion concert titled “Christmalowin,” with Seo Taiji Co. officials previously stating that they are pulling out all the stops for the upcoming concert, which they have referred to as a “blockbuster” event. Last week, officials revealed that IU will also be joining Seo on stage for a collaborative performance of the two’s “Sogyeokdong” single. Although his “Quiet Night” album is not slated to be released until Oct. 20, the singer is expected to perform the tracks of his new album live at his concert for the first time, as well as perform some of Seo Taiji and Boys’ most iconic hits such as “Come Back Home,” “Hayeoga” and more. Following the Seoul concert, the musician is expected to host a number of concerts nationwide.

Immediately upon its release, the new album swept the nation’s music charts. Title track “Story of Our Lives (feat. Megan Lee)” became the No. 1 song and several others made the top 10 list on major music websites such as Melon, Bugs Music, Naver Music and more. “Chapter 8” was released in commemoration of g.o.d.’s 15th anniversary.   The album was co-produced by renowned producer Double Kick and g.o.d. vocalist Kim Tae-woo. They chose to present music that is “truly representative of g.o.d.” and “able to appeal to people of all ages,” according to g.o.d.’s agency SidusHQ. Numerous tracks on the album bring back the group’s original sound and signature musical colors, defined by the soaring vocals of Kim Tae-woo, Son Ho-young, Danny Ahn and Yoon Kye-sang alongside Park Jun-hyung’s unique rapping. One of four lead singles “Story of Our Lives,” featuring vocalist Megan Lee from MBC’s “Star Audition: The Great Birth,” is a warm tune about expressing due appreciation for family, whom many tend to forget as they get on with their lives. The opening instrumental track “5+4+1+5=15,” recorded by the Czech National Symphony Orchestra, looks back on g.o.d.’s musical history. Excerpts from past hits including “Sky Blue Balloon,” “Dear Mother,” “I Love You and Remember,” “Lie” and “Road” can be heard alongside witty narrations by g.o.d. members.  Another lead single “Saturday Night” is an upbeat song filled with pop-groove sounds reminiscent of “Friday Night” from the group’s second album “Chapter 2.” “An Ordinary Day,” originally recorded on the group’s 6th album without Yoon Kye-sang, was remade for the new album, this time including all five original members. “Sing For Me” is a collaboration between g.o.d. and popular vocalist IU, showcasing sweet melodies, vocal harmonies and playful narrations. “The Lone Duckling” and “Sky Blue Promise,” g.o.d.’s chart-topping tracks revealed last month prior to the LP’s release, are included on “Chapter 8” as well. Given the album’s high popularity and heightened interest from a large number of fans, SidusHQ said the group may appear on-screen over the next few weeks. “g.o.d. may potentially be making television appearances after wrapping up their Seoul concerts,” said the agency. “The members will most likely feature on music programs, though not music ranking programs.” Meanwhile, g.o.d. will kick off its nationwide 15th anniversary reunion concert tour with two performances on July 12 and 13 at the Auxiliary Stadium at Sports Complex in Jamsil, Seoul. The five idols will continue with performances in Gwangju on Aug. 2-3, Busan on Aug. 15-16, Daegu on Aug. 23-24 and Daejeon on Aug. 30-31. Pop group g.o.d. (Groove Overdose) is considered one of the most famous K-pop boy bands in South Korea. The group first debuted in 1999 with the single “Dear Mother” and shot to stardom with major hits such as “Lie” and “One Candle,” garnering a large number of fans at the time. Yoon Kye-sang left g.o.d. in 2002, after which the remaining four members released a seventh studio album “Into the Sky” in 2005 and parted ways the following year to pursue individual careers under separate management agencies.

The upcoming song is a collaborative track by the five original members of Ulala Session ― consisting of Lim, Kim Myung-hoon, Park Seung-il, Park Kwang-sun and Koonzo (who joined the group in 2012) ― and popular female singer IU. The single contains the voice of Lim, who passed away last year after battling gastric cancer for several years. Titled “Anxious Heart,” the collaboration is a bright and harmonious song that fuses the different vocal colors of Ulala Session and IU, according to Ulala Company. It was recorded back in 2012, while Lim was receiving treatment and fighting cancer, according to officials. Though the song had been scheduled to release in 2013, it was put on hold indefinitely following Lim’s death in February 2013. The song’s producer, The Lyrics, decided to delay the track’s release to the following year, in the hopes that Lim’s passion for music would not be tainted by commercial concerns. The new single is slated to hold a special meaning for many fans of Lim and Ulala Session, given that it is Lim’s last official track recorded before his death. Ulala Session rose to prominence after winning Mnet’s audition program “Superstar K” in 2011. The group impressed viewers with its soulful vocals and impressive performances, becoming the talk of the town during the show’s running.

For every track, IU keeps a careful balance between preserving the song’s original sentiments and altering the original with her own color and arrangements. Age does not seem to preclude the 21-year-old singer from reviving old classics released even before she was born. The lead single “My Old Story” is a remake of the 80s singer-songwriter Cho Duk-bae’s original, which portrays a boy reminiscing about a past love. IU sings yearningly as if she is reciprocating the boy’s original message. A mix of piano, strings and accordion imbue the song with an analogue feel. IU’s arrangement of the late Kim Gwang-suk’s “Flower” features a slow classic guitar tune alongside the young singer’s intensely poignant vocals. On the other hand, “Pierrot Laughs At Us” on her album has a lighter, groovier melody that adds a jazzy touch to the original sung by Kim Wan-sun. “The Meaning Of You” is a true mix of the old and the new, as Sanullim’s vocalist Kim Chang-wan, who sang the original, is featured alongside IU. A special narration by Clone is featured in “Boom Ladi Dadi” as well. All in all, IU’s new covers album provides a pleasant, calming respite from the mainstream music of today’s times. (jiyoung.sohn@heraldcorp.com) Mariah Carey an elusive, uneven chanteuse  Mariah Carey  “Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse”   (Def Jam) Mariah Carey’s latest album kicks off in wonderful and typical Mariah form: She sings a song that immediately pulls you in, which has ranged from a killer club jam to a searing slow song in the past. “Cry,” a torching, emotional tune, is the song that does its job on “Me. I Am Mariah ... The Elusive Chanteuse.” You feel like you are about to experience musical bliss, and most of the time Carey has been able to hit it out of the park. But like many veteran all-stars, there comes a time when singers make more errors and can’t score a hit like they used to. Sadly, that is what is happening with Carey. The batch of tracks on her 14th record are enjoyable, but they don‘t have the pizazz and spark of her past albums, including 2009’s “Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel,” her worst-selling album, though musically it was one of the year’s best works. “Elusive Chanteuse” borrows from Carey’s earlier work ― and while the powerful singer still has the vocal chops, her songs find her looking too much to the past.

That would be a mistake. These songs capture the world through the eyes of a 26-year-old, with all of its complicated contradictions. As such they‘re modest and ambitious, bold and shy, intimate and grand. They’re conversational, confessional and confident, free of frills and full of good advice. As a bonus, one of them rhymes “Fauntleroy” with “La-Z-Boy.” These songs have been performed in coffeehouses and at festivals, on a cruise ship and at the Grammys pre-show, where Fullbright‘s studio debut competed against Mumford & Sons, Bonnie Raitt and others. Their descendants date to the 1970s, when singer-songwriters ruled the pop charts, and also the 1930s, when timeless tunes came from an Oklahoma troubadour named Woody Guthrie.

IU, however, said, “I felt I could do both.” “I was into the second week of activities for my new album when I received the synopsis, and it was great fun to read,” the 20-year-old singer-actress explained as to why she could not turn down the opportunity despite its overlap with her singing schedule. IU’s latest role, which she describes as a mash-up of her “Dream High” character and her “You’re the Best!” heroine, is a left-of-center, near-geek girl who pines for a handsome ladies’ man-in-the-making, played by hallyu star Jang Keun-suk. In the drama ― which is based on a comic book series ― Jang’s hero, Dokgo Mate, makes his way up the social ladder with the aid of 10 well-heeled women who are enamored with his striking good looks and charm. One can only guess that as he dates a string of wealthy socialites, Dokgo will eventually see the true swan in Bo-tong’s ugly duckling. Jang, himself, already sees the real thespian in IU. “She is like a veteran actress who has been honing her craft for years,” Jang, 26, said of working with her at the drama’s press conference on Monday. Since IU made her debut in 2008, she has proven herself well-steeled for all the fame and success that has come her way, displaying an even-keeled ability to intercept most any question with earnest, sometimes unexpected, answers. At the press event, IU answered questions regarding what kind of men she finds charming with ease, saying, “A man of many talents, and I do not mean someone who can carve out a lucrative career for himself, per se.” After a pause, she added, out of left field, “Like a guy who is exceptionally gifted at playing a short bamboo flute?” Amidst all the fun and laughter, IU shed some light on how she has kept it together throughout her rise to stardom. “After debuting I think it was smart to use a stage name,” said IU. “I can separate my personal from my public life.” The starlet, who turned 20 this year, elaborated that as IU, she has grown wiser and increasingly thoughtful about her work life. Conversely, as Lee Ji-eun, IU said she has been able to increasingly simplify her private life, dwell less on matters and stay true to her emotions and her personal relationships. “I think that is good,” she said. “Bel Ami” starts airing Nov. 20 Wednesday and Thursday nights on KBS 2 TV at 10 p.m. By Jean Oh ()",iu,5.0,"The article specifically mentions IU (아이유) and focuses on her dual career as a singer-songwriter and actress, highlighting her new album ""Modern Times"" and her lead role in the TV drama ""Bel Ami.""

(임우정 인턴기자 / 코리아헤럴드) <관련영문기사>   Netizens cracking down on plagiarism scandals plaguing K-pop world    The recent charges of plagiarism involving local hip-hop artist Primary has brought the Korean music industry’s notorious past and ongoing allegations of plagiarism to the fore.  Many are now questioning how these accusations will impact the future of the industry. Thanks to the infinite capabilities of the Internet, netizens have been exposing supposed plagiarism. “As bad as an accusation of plagiarism can be, the resolution of plagiarism in Korea might actually be far worse,” said one industry insider. “A false claim can seriously damage a person‘s career while a true claim can be very difficult to collect any sort of financial damages for.” The single “I Got C” was produced by Primary along with comedian Park Myung-soo for the newly released album “Jayuro Music Festival” by the members of popular MBC variety program “Infinite Challenge.” The single became a big hit, topping the local real time music charts. However, soon after the song’s release, netizens revealed that Primary’s track, along with several other tracks previously produced by the artist, bore striking resemblances to songs produced by David Schreurs. Schreurs produced Dutch singer Caro Emerald’s “Liquid Lunch,” from which the Korean hip-hop artist is accused of lifting the melody. “These days, there are more and more overseas producers, composers and songwriters expressing interest working with Korean music artists,” said the industry insider. “Although such international collaborations are becoming more commonplace in the industry, any time a high profile plagiarism case emerges, it never looks good.” The K-pop industry is no stranger to copyright infringement allegations, with some of the most notorious cases involving some of the nation’s biggest acts, including Big Bang leader G-Dragon and solo diva Lee Hyori. This year alone Primary is merely joining a list of other stars such as IU and Roy Kim, whom netizens have accused of having tracks that sound far too similar to other artists’ work. Netizens have raised plagiarism allegations against K-pop star IU’s lead track “The Red Shoes” from her recently released third studio album “Modern Times.” They claim the track sounds strikingly similar to German duo Nekta’s “Here’s Us,” an electro-jazz pop track released in 2009.

Many are now questioning how these accusations will impact the future of the industry. Thanks to the infinite capabilities of the Internet, netizens have been exposing supposed plagiarism. “As bad as an accusation of plagiarism can be, the resolution of plagiarism in Korea might actually be far worse,” said one industry insider. “A false claim can seriously damage a person‘s career while a true claim can be very difficult to collect any sort of financial damages for.” The single “I Got C” was produced by Primary along with comedian Park Myung-soo for the newly released album “Jayuro Music Festival” by the members of popular MBC variety program “Infinite Challenge.” The single became a big hit, topping the local real time music charts. However, soon after the song’s release, netizens revealed that Primary’s track, along with several other tracks previously produced by the artist, bore striking resemblances to songs produced by David Schreurs. Schreurs produced Dutch singer Caro Emerald’s “Liquid Lunch,” from which the Korean hip-hop artist is accused of lifting the melody. “These days, there are more and more overseas producers, composers and songwriters expressing interest working with Korean music artists,” said the industry insider. “Although such international collaborations are becoming more commonplace in the industry, any time a high profile plagiarism case emerges, it never looks good.” The K-pop industry is no stranger to copyright infringement allegations, with some of the most notorious cases involving some of the nation’s biggest acts, including Big Bang leader G-Dragon and solo diva Lee Hyori. This year alone Primary is merely joining a list of other stars such as IU and Roy Kim, whom netizens have accused of having tracks that sound far too similar to other artists’ work. Netizens have raised plagiarism allegations against K-pop star IU’s lead track “The Red Shoes” from her recently released third studio album “Modern Times.” They claim the track sounds strikingly similar to German duo Nekta’s “Here’s Us,” an electro-jazz pop track released in 2009. Some netizens went as far as to compile a YouTube comparison clip of the two songs played back to back, with others even overlapping the tracks so listeners could hear them simultaneously, highlighting the similarities.

Title track “The Red Shoes” showcases IU’s vocals in a cabaret-style setting, complete with blaring horns and lively percussion. Like many of the tracks on the album, vintage sounds and modern effects are put together artfully, forming a fresh but familiar compilation of songs. “Modern Times” has a distinct carefree feel that is reminiscent of jazz during the Roaring Twenties. “Everyone has Secrets” features Brown Eyed Girls member Ga-in and is a bossa nova number that mixes the two singers’ voices well. “Walk with Me, Girl” features veteran singer Choi Baek-ho and provides an interesting traditional Korean-sounding vocal into the mix. “A Gloomy Clock” features SHINee’s Jong-hyun and is one of the most modern-sounding tracks in the whole album. The track provides listeners with an interesting array of bubbling, ticking, whistling and xylophone sounds, making for a playful song. By Cha Yo-rim (yorimcha@heraldcorp.com) Miley Cyrus‘s new album shows promise   Miley Cyrus,   “Bangerz”  (RCA) Cyrus’ “Bangerz,” her fourth album, is a collection that marks the 20-year-old‘s musical breakthrough. The former “Hannah Montana” star kicks off the 13-track set with “Adore You,” a downbeat song about love. Other tracks that follow with that energy -- “Wrecking Ball,” “My Darlin” and “Somewhere Else” -- capture a more mature, nuanced side of Cyrus that we haven’t seen much of -- and that‘s a welcome change. When she explores the different emotions of her character and doesn’t play the caricature that she‘s become, you’re able to appreciate Cyrus as an artist. The Britney Spears-assisted “SMS (Bangerz)” and the Pharrell-produced “(hash)GETITRIGHT” are addictive, feel-good, up-tempo pop tunes; “FU” -- guess what it stands for -- has Cyrus semi-angry over a dramatic beat, and it makes for an overall punchy and amazing track; and “4x4,” featuring Nelly, is a pop-twang adventure. Even “Do My Thang” -- where Cyrus isn‘t too convincing as a rapper -- sounds good thanks to the groovy hook that she sings, and will.i.am’s Southern hip-hop-flavored beat. (AP) McCartney stays fresh, familiar on ‘New’ Paul McCartney   “New”   (Hear Music) For his 16th solo record, and first of original material in six years, Paul McCartney turned to a team of four hot producers to come up with something “New.” The result is both fresh and comfortably familiar. McCartney, a master of the catchy three-minute pop song, isn‘t reinventing himself here as the title may suggest. Just try listening to “On My Way to Work” or “Queenie Eye” without bobbing your head along to the beat. Really, love him or hate him, few can pump out these types of ditties quite like McCartney. Still, he’s no Bob Dylan. There are flirtations with material with some gravitas here, but it‘s just that -- a flirtation. Much of the credit for the success of “New” goes to McCartney’s four producers -- especially Paul Epworth (Adele) and Mark Ronson (Amy Winehouse). The other two, Giles Martin and Ethan Johns, are the sons of famous Beatles producers George Martin and Glyn Johns. While the multi-producer approach could have resulted in a hot mess, the end result is surprisingly cohesive, modern-sounding and, most of all, fun to listen to.

Some of next month’s highly anticipated releases include K-pop idols IU, T-ara, Nine Muses and Kim Jae-joong of JYJ. However, the list doesn’t end there: Other scheduled K-pop releases include new beats from groups such as Block B, Boys Republic, Monday Kids and others. Superstar rapper Psy previously stated that his upcoming studio album was to be released sometime this month, but no new updates have been announced regarding its status.  IU “Modern Times”   Twenty-year-old K-pop starlet IU will be shifting gears to a more mature and sophisticated sound and image with her upcoming third full album “Modern Times,” which will drop on Oct. 7. The soon-to-be-released 13-track album (which includes one bonus track) is said to feature songs of a wide variety of genres including swing, folk, bossa nova, Latin pop and more. “Modern Times” also contains two of the singer’s self-composed singles, titled “Voice Mail” and “A Day I Hate.” IU recently released a teaser clip of one of the singles from the new album titled “Between the Lips (50 cm).” The track has a European-style burlesque jazz sound to it, which is a big shift from the young singer’s K-pop roots.  T-ara “T-ara’s Effect” Despite the controversy that surrounded the K-pop idol group T-ara over the past year regarding member Hwa-young’s decision to leave the group because she was allegedly bullied by the other members, the remaining members are returning to the scene with the upcoming album “T-ara’s Effect.” Although rumors circulated that newest group member Dani would make her official debut with T-ara through the new album, the group’s agency Core Contents Media announced that this will not happen quite yet and that T-ara will be promoted as a six-member band for the time being. “T-ara’s Effects” is slated to be released on Oct. 10.  Nine Muses More than three years since their debut, the ladies of Nine Muses are finally gearing up to release the group’s first full studio album. The yet-to-be-titled album is scheduled to be released sometime next month. The women of Nine Muses made their debut back in 2010 with the track “No Playboy” from the group’s first single “Let’s Have a Party.” Since its debut, the group has released a string of singles but was oftentimes overshadowed by other more popular releases. In January, Nine Muses released its comeback single “Dolls” and landed a spot on the top 10 list of several local real-time charts, marking the group’s first strong release. The girls later released the sexy, electro-pop follow-up single “Wild,” along with the accompanying EP in May.  Kim Jae-joong   Idol star Kim Jae-joong of the JYJ trio is making his return as a soloist with the announcement that he is planning to release his first solo studio album at the end of October, according to a representative at C-JeS Entertainment. In January, Kim transformed himself into a rocker for the release of his solo debut EP album “I.” The five-track album topped the weekly charts in Korea as well as breaking the record for preorders in Japan. It has been reported that the artist’s first full studio album will be another rock-type album and Kim will be going on tour after its release. Although the star’s agency did not reveal the locations of the tour, it was announced that tour would not be exclusive to Korea.

'강남스타일'과 '젠틀맨'으로 역시 음원 강자로 우뚝 선 싸이도 연내 새 음반을 예고했다. 당초 이달 발매를 목표로 했으나 음반 작업 상황으로 인해 다소 미뤄진 상태다. 소속사인 YG엔터테인먼트 관계자는 ""지난여름부터 작곡가 유건형 씨와 함께 미국에서 음반 작업에 매진하고 있다""며 ""신곡 작업이 완성되는 시점에 맞춰 10월, 11월 등 글로벌한 출시 일정을 잡을 계획""이라고 전했다. 전속 계약 분쟁을 마치고 1년 만에 컴백하는 그룹 블락비가 오는 10월 2일 세 번째 미니앨범을 선보인다. 지난 23일 온라인에 먼저 공개한 수록곡 '빛이 되어줘'는 리더 지코가 만든 노래로 이날 일부 음원차트 1위 등 주요 차트 10위권에 진입했다. 뒤를 이어 10월 10일 걸그룹 티아라가 새 앨범으로 컴백한다. 팀멤버들의 탈퇴로 각종 구설에 올랐지만 그간 중독성 강한 노래로 음원차트 정상을 찍은 저력이 있고 새롭게 6인조로 컴백하는 만큼 화제성은 여전하다. JYJ의 김재중도 10월 말 솔로로 첫 번째 정규 앨범을 선보인다. 지난 1월 발표한 미니앨범 '마인(MINE)'이 록 장르임에도 리패키지 앨범을 포함해 20만 장의 판매량을 기록하며 탄탄한 팬덤을 자랑했다. 이번 앨범에는 한층 대중적인 록을 선보일 예정이어서 음원 차트 선전도 기대해볼 만하다. 이들은 앞서 후배들보다 음원 차트에서 다소 약세였지만 올해는 상반기 조용필, 이승철 등 중견 가수들의 앨범이 대중적으로 재조명 받은 해여서 새로운 돌풍이 기대된다. 계절적으로도 이들의 감성적인 음악이 맞아떨어지는 시기다. 신승훈은 10월 중순 미니앨범 '그레이트 웨이브(Great Wave)'를 낸다. 지난 2008년부터 시작한 3연 작 미니앨범 시리즈 '쓰리 웨이브스 오브 언익스펙티드 트위스트(3 waves of unexpected twist)'의 완결판이다. 소속사인 도로시컴퍼니 관계자는 ""녹음 막바지 단계로 믹싱, 마스터링 작업을 남겨뒀다""며 ""많은 시도와 변화, 다양성을 강조한 앨범""이라고 설명했다. 11월이 되면 이적이 5집을 낸다. 지난 2010년 4집 '사랑'을 발표한 이후 3년 만의 새 앨범이다. 이적은 최근 자신의 홈페이지와 트위터를 통해 앨범 작업 상황을 공개하고, 뮤직비디오 제작 현장 사진을 올려 궁금증을 유발했다. '토이'란 이름으로 앨범을 내는 유희열의 7집도 11-12월 중 출시된다. 지난 2007년 발표한 6집 '땡큐' 이후 6년 만에 발표하는 정규 앨범인 만큼 심혈을 기울여 작업 중으로 여느 때처럼 다양한 객원 보컬을 기용할 예정이다.   <관련 영문 기사>  Stellar lineup set to rock Korean music scene  South Korean singers, from idol groups to veteran singer-songwriters, are set to liven up the music scene here with a slew of new albums set for release before the end of the year. Indie band Busker Busker made a comeback with its much-anticipated second album Wednesday. All nine tracks swept the major music charts on the day of release. The group was unearthed by an audition program and enjoyed great success with its first album, filled with unique acoustic sounds and an analog aesthetic. Rap sensation Psy, who surprised the world with megahits “Gangnam Style” and “Gentleman,” is poised to return to the music scene with new album set for this fall. YG Entertainment, Psy’s agency, raised fans’ expectations, saying: “Many top world class artists participated in the new album.” Singer and actress IU has become a fixture on the charts with an array of hits. She will release her third album “Modern Times” on Oct. 3. The 20-year-old singer distinguished herself from other pop stars by bringing older generation musicians, such as Choi Baek-ho and Yang Hee-eun, to feature for the album. The competition among idol stars is expected to heat up throughout the autumn as well. With mini-album “Number 9,” girl group T-ara is out for a chance to bounce back from a bullying scandal, which has brought it much controversy and criticism. The group has been ranked fairly high on the local music charts with hooks and the new title song reportedly has a catchy melody. Block B, another idol band with a tough year, comes back to the stage on Oct. 2. The boy band has ended a year of legal battles over an exclusive contract with its former agency and unveiled “Be the Light,” one of the tracks, prior to the release of its third EP album, on Monday. The song is composed and written by the team’s leader Zico and it instantly topped some music charts on the day. Hallyu star and member of JYJ, Kim Jae-Joong, will release his first full album as a solo artist at the end of October. About 200,000 copies of his first solo EP, released in January, were sold, showing the power of his wide fan support across the Asia. The album will be a pop rock effort, according to his agency. Masters of sentimental ballads which are suited for the fall and winter season also joined the lineup. Shin Seung-hun, nicknamed “the prince of ballads.” returns with EP “Great Wave” in October. The 45-year-old veteran signer highlighted diversity and new approaches to music through the album, according to Shin’s agency Dorothy Company. Fans of the project group Toy have waited six years for new songs after its sixth album “Thank you” in 2007. You Hee-yeol who leads the group is said to be working with various guest vocalists as usual. The musician has not yet elaborated on details, but it is only known that the album will be released within this year. Solo artist Lee Juck showed glimpse of the making process for his fifth album, which planned for release in November via Twitter. Lee gained popularity since his debut in 1995 in the duo Panic.

SBS 드라마 “천일의 약속”과 KBS2 드라마 “엄마가 뿔났다” 같은 수많은 히트작을 배출했던 김수현 작가의 드라마에서 연기의 첫발을 들인 그는 스크린과 TV를 오가며 필모그래피를 쌓았다. 그러던 그는 작년 11월부터 방영했던 SBS “드라마의 제왕”에서 제대로 빛을 내기 시작했다. 4차원적인 한류 스타 캐릭터를 소화해내면서 연기자로써도 전혀 손색없는 모습을 보여줬다. 연기에 지속적인 관심을 보여온 최시원이 진정한 “드라마의 제왕”이 될지는 지켜볼 일이다.  7. 김동완 김동완 또한 신화로 데뷔하기 전 MBC 드라마 ”산""에서 연기를 시작했다. 신화로 활동하는 와중에도 지속적으로 스크린에 얼굴을 비추며 경험을 탄탄히 쌓았다. 특유의 ‘스마일 페이스’로 2002년에는 KBS2 “천국의 아이들”에서 주인공 기호태 역을 맡았고 그로부터 4년 뒤엔 박선영과 함께 KBS2 “슬픔이여 안녕”에서도 주연으로 출연했다. ’1세대 아이돌‘인 그는 오랜 노력 끝에 비로소 2011년 MBC 광복절 특집 2부작 “절정”이라는 작품에서 이육사 역을 연기하게 됐고 이 드라마는 휴스턴국제영화제(WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival) 특집극 부문에서 대상을 받았다. “절정”이 김동완에게 기존 연기 스타일을 더 다듬고, 연기자의 타이틀을 거머쥘 수 있는 하나의 전환점이 되어주지 않았나 싶다. 석지현 기자   (monicasuk@heraldcorp.com)     <관련 영문 기사>  Top 7 idol-turned-actors  There was a time when critics were not so generous in apprasing idol stars who took to acting on the big or small screen. While that prejudice is still alive, many of them have successfully overcome criticism to grow into full-fledged actors. 1. Park Yu-chun Not many people had high expectations for Park Yu-chun in 2010 when the singer said he would start acting. Park made his first appearance on the small screen with “Sungkyunkwan Scandal” and excelled at portraying Lee Sun-joon in the fusion historical drama. The selection of genre for his acting debut was perhaps an ideal one, as fusion historical dramas have historically had mass appeal. Park could have chosen the safe path of acting by choosing a romantic comedy as his follow-up project. Against his fans’ expectations, he decided to go for melodrama. With “Miss Ripley” costarring Lee Da-hae, he built his reputation as an actor. The last two dramas he starred in -- “Rooftop Prince” and “Missing You” -- also confirmed his talent for acting. Just three years into his acting career, the JYJ member garnered four major acting awards, in the KBS Drama Acting Awards in 2010, Paeksang Arts Awards and MBC Drama Awards in 2011, and SBS Drama Awards in 2012. 2. Lee Jung-shin It was evident at the beginning of “My Daughter Seo-young” that Lee Jung-shin was starting from scratch. Beginning from zero, he had nothing to lose, and he had veteran actors such as Chun Ho-jin and Kim Hye-ok as mentors. Leaving all the awkward reactions and facial expressions in the earlier part of the story, his acting skills remarkably improved through the 50-part series. Competition between the CNBLUE members could have been the strongest motivation for the bassist. All four band mates have experience in acting including leader Jung Yong-hwa, who played in “You’re Beautiful” and “Heartstrings.” With “My Daughter Seo-young,” the musician gained wider recognition as an actor as well. 3. IU The influx of idols in the K-drama sphere reached its peak in 2011 when “Dream High” first hit the airwaves. TV screens were brimming with young artists such as Taecyeon and Wooyoung of 2PM, Eunjung of Tiara and Bae Suzy of MissA. IU did not have many scenes in her debut drama but she made a stepping stone of it and landed her first lead role in “You’re the Best, Lee Soon-shin.” Already a successful singer, IU’s acting success is likely to be judged by her current drama and the next role. 4. Seo In-guk The winner of Mnet’s audition program “Superstar K” did not have much luck when he first made his debut as a singer. Seo In-guk had also tried appearing on variety shows to make himself known, but he was always tagged as “the guy from Superstar K.” His fate began to change forever when he starred in “Respond 1997” with Jung Eun-ji of girl group A Pink. Riding the waves of ’90s sensation the drama made, Seo finally kicked the label of “the guy from Superstar K” and found his real name. After making his appearance in the weekend series “Rascal Sons,” Seo came back to where he belongs and gained further popularity through a new album. 5. Bae Suzy Without a doubt, Bae Suzy is the most successful actress among idol singers. She gave acting a try in “Dream High” but no one had expected that she would become the queen of local box office last year. “Architecture 101,” Lee Yong-joo’s megahit film that lured 4.1 million moviegoers last year, launched Bae into stardom and gave her the nickname of “everyone’s first crush.” Although she still has that reputation from her debut flick, Bae has not been able to meet her fans’ expectations in “Big” and “Gu Family Book.” 6. Choi Si-won Choi Si-won made his name known as an actor before making his debut K-pop group Super Junior. His first drama “Precious Family” was written by popular script writer Kim Soo-hyun, who also wrote “A Thousand Days’ Promise” and “Mom’s Dead Upset.” After playing several minor and main roles both on the small and big screens he made a breakthrough in his acting career last year with “The King of Dramas.” Choi received positive reviews for depicting his character Kang Hyun-min, a handsome but short-tempered and egoistic actor. Proving himself a real heartthrob, he made a smooth start to become the king of dramas. 7. Kim Dong-wan Kim Dong-wan was an actor at the age of 17 before becoming a member of boy band Shinhwa. The “Hey Come On” singer kept his dream as an actor while pursuing singing activities. With his trademark smiley face he landed more roles in popular dramas such as “Children of Heaven” in 2002 and “A Farewell to Sorrow” in 2005. In 2011, Kim played the male lead in “The Peak,” set during the Japanese colonial rule. The two-part series was recognized by the WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival and took the grand prize in the TV Special-Dramatic segment. Critics say the award-winning drama provided Kim a chance to go beyond his former style of acting and helped him mature as an actor.

South Korean singer IU claimed the 15th spot on the U.S. Billboard’s “21 Under 21: Music‘s Hottest Minors 2012” list, according to the magazine.
Billboard, an international newsweekly magazine devoted to the music industry, said the 19-year-old singer “affectionately known as the nation’s ‘little sister,’” became a bona fide superstar this year for her “unique charm and undeniable hits.”
It said the singer‘s reign began with the release of her comeback single “You and I,” the No. 1 song of Billboard’s K-Pop Hot 100 chart of the past year, which was released in August.
“While IU hasn‘t hit the same level of global viral awareness as Psy, her popularity has led to success in Japan, where she celebrated Hot 100 hits with Japanese versions of ’You and I‘ and her single ’Good Day‘,” the magazine said.
The list was populated by artists such as Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus and One Direction.

HONG KONG (AFP) ― Thousands of fans flocked to a major K-pop concert in Hong Kong on Saturday, cheering an array of South Korean stars in the latest sign of the pop music phenomenon’s rising popularity.
Music Bank featured eight popular South Korean artists and was the largest K-pop concert to be held in the southern Chinese city.
Boy band TVXQ and singing starlet IU were among the groups that danced and sang to a sea of exuberant fans.

아시아 한류 열풍의 중심지 중 한 곳인 홍콩에서 23일 케이팝(K-POP) 그룹 8개 팀이 참가한 대규모 콘서트가 열렸다.
KBS 가요프로그램인 뮤직뱅크의 해외 녹화로 진행된 이날 공연에는 동방신기를 비롯해 원더걸스와 엠블랙, 비스트, 인피니트, 에프엑스, 아이유, 씨엔블루가 참가해 각자 3~4곡씩 히트곡을 홍콩 케이팝 팬들에게 선사했다.
공연은 7천500석 규모의 공연장인 아시아 월드 아레나에서 진행됐으며 스탠딩 관람객까지 모두 1만여명이 3시간가량 이어진 공연을 관람했다.

이번 공연 입장권은 780~1천280홍콩달러(약 11만~19만원)로 비교적 고가였으나 KBS 측은 ""가장 비싼 표가 가장 먼저 매진됐다""고 밝혔다.

YEOSU, South Jeolla Province -- Multimedia shows and fireworks embroidered the skies above the waters off this southern coastal town Friday evening during the Expo 2012 Yeosu opening ceremony.

Other dignitaries from around the world such as Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, President Ollanta Humala of Peru, Prime Minister Karim Massimov of Kazakhstan, President James Michel of Seychelles and President Anote Tong of Kiribati were also present as well as Korean lawmakers and regional leaders.
Over the next three months, 104 countries, 10 international organizations including the U.N., 23 local governments and Korea’s leading companies will take part in the Yeosu Expo.
“Together with these participants, the Expo will provide an opportunity to address the challenge of climate change faced by the international community, and propose the ocean as the vision for sustainable development of humankind in the 21st century,” Kang Dong-suk, chairman of the Yeosu Expo organizing committee, said in his welcome remarks.
“The organizing committee has made its utmost efforts to prepare exhibitions that will showcase the preciousness and endless possibilities of the ocean, the Expo’s theme.”
BIE’s Loscertales thanked the Korean government for its cooperation and “the opportunity to bring to the citizens and the world a better understanding of the oceans and coasts for the benefit of humankind.”
“Expo 2012 Yeosu is, through its powerful theme, an urgent call for attention to the oceans and coasts as living entities that support life on the planet,” Loscertales said in his congratulatory speech.
“Every field of human activity is touched by the health of maritime resources, and every citizen on this planet can contribute, in a smaller or bigger way, to their preservation.”
To match the theme of the Expo “Living Ocean and Coast,” the opening ceremony consisted of various parades and performances ranging from K-pop to traditional music on the waters.
The ceremony, themed “Dreaming Ocean,” began with an open concert by a wind orchestra and a choir on the floating stage while dozens of sailboats, yachts and traditional boats paraded on the sea. Video images featuring the life and potential of the ocean were played on the Big O.
In the second part of the ceremony, celebrated pansori (Korean traditional narrative singing) artist Ahn Suk-seon and a dance troupe performed “Binari,” a well-wishing song sung during shamanistic rites.
Following the Binari performance, the audience blew Korean conch horns together, starting a parade by an 11-meter-tall giant wooden marionette named “Yeonani” and figures resembling sea creatures.
Then K-pop singer IU sang the expo theme song “Stories Told by the Sea,” while flag bearers entered the stage with the flags of Korea, the BIE, the Expo and the participating countries.
The national anthem of Korea and the BIE were played, followed by speeches by the organizing committee chairman and the BIE secretary general.
President Lee announced the opening of the expo, starting a fireworks display and lighting show.
The remainder of the opening ceremony was comprised of performances by world-renowned soprano Jo Su-mi, B-boys, dance troupes, musical actors and more K-pop musicians, followed by night multimedia shows.
Jo sang the theme song of the Expo’s main weekday show with a choir of children from interracial families.
K-pop groups 2NE1 and Big Bang also performed their hit songs.
The highlight of the opening ceremony was the Big O Show, in which various images were projected on a circular water screen named “The-O” using lasers and holograms along with fountain shows and fireworks. The Big O Show will be held every night throughout the Expo. The three-hour ceremony was broadcast live by KBS-TV.

KUALA LUMPUR ― “Dream High,” a Korean musical drama co-produced and distributed by KBS was nominated on Tuesday in the youth category of Rose d’Or, a global television festival in Switzerland.
The Korean drama was the only Asian program out of 36 nominated for one of 12 different categories at the festival in Lucerne, which runs from May 7-10.
The drama that portrays the passion and agony of teens dreaming about becoming stars will compete in the festival against BBC’s “Leonardo, Wing and a Prayer,” and “You’re Not a Werewolf” by West German Broadcasting.
The BBC show is an action-packed mystery and drama series about a teenage Leonardo da Vinci, while the German program follows a problem-solving Wolfman who gives advice to struggling teens. More than 400 programs from around the world were submitted for nominations.
“Recently, Korean dramas as well as K-pop are getting popular not only in Asia but also in Europe and the Americas. I think the jury gave higher marks because the program effectively combined the two power factors,” Cho Dae-hyun, president of KBS Media, told The Korea Herald at the Nominees Night in Kuala Lumpur.
Cast of “Dream High” (KBS)
KBS programs have been nominated for the Golden Rose Awards since 2006. In 2010, two programs by KBS ― “My Too Perfect Sons” and “The Golden Bell Challenge” ― were nominated. However, none have ever won a prize.
Cho said this year will be different because of the growing interest in K-pop all over the world, as well as the quality and creativity of South Korean dramas, which have matured over the years.
“The Korean entertainment industry is the one of the most competitive markets in the world. We train actors and singers for many years to create quality dramas as well as entertainment programs. And also we collaborate with world-renowned experts,” Cho said.
“I know the Rose d’Or festival is putting more focus on programs from Europe and the Americas and hopefully it also will be the place where more Asian works can be introduced,” he added.
“Dream High,” aired in early 2011, was produced by Bae Yong-jun, an actor who achieved pan-Asian fame with hit drama “Winter Sonata.” Bae also starred in the series.
The drama features K-pop stars including Taecyeon and Wooyoung from boyband 2PM, Ham Eun-jeong from girl group T-ara and singer IU. It was also partly produced by Park Jin-young, singer and producer for JYP Entertainment.
“Dream High,” gained a viewers’ rating of over 20 percent in Korea, and was exported to more than 20 countries in Asia and in Europe, said Cho of KBS Media, a KBS affiliate in charge of both domestic and overseas sales of the broadcaster’s content.
The drama drew attention from many Asian TV producers and managers who attended the Rose d’Or’s Nominees Night event in Kuala Lumpur, its first official event in Asia. The Swiss-based festival aims to bring more Asian programs to its annual event.
“The answer is simple: Asia’s television market is the second largest in the world and it is growing fast,” said Marc Walder, CEO of Ringier Switzerland and Germany. Ringier Switzerland is the largest media company in the country and the parent company of the Rose d’Or.
Founded in 1961 in Montreux, the Rose d’Or Festival is now held in Lucerne, Switzerland, and is one of the world’s most prestigious entertainment television festivals. It has become a platform and a marketplace for TV professionals, producers, managers of private and public TV stations and production companies from all over the world.
An international jury of 50 experts selects three nominees in each category. The winners in the 12 categories ― including comedy, sitcom, game show, live event show and TV movie ― and the Best of 2012 will be selected by a final, 10-member jury.

Now that the South Korean drama market has started to jump on board the multi-season series bandwagon, it seems there is no end to the trend.
When KBS’ “Dream High” ― a music-and-dance teen drama ― pulled in strong ratings during its winter run a little over a year ago, it should have come as no surprise that the team behind the series would decide to green light a second season.
In terms of production, little has changed. Holym ― a joint venture formed by JYP Entertainment and Bae Yong-joon’s agency, Keyeast ― is co-producing the sequel with CJ E&M yet again.
Furthermore, JYP Entertainment head Park Jin-young retains both his role as the series’ music and dance director as well as his stint as a teacher (which he played with endearing goofiness) at the art school where “Dream High” is set.
At the drama’s press conference Tuesday, Park highlighted the primary difference between the first season and “Dream High 2.”
“‘Dream High 1’ was my first time doing it all,” he said, referring to his involvement both behind-the-scenes and onscreen. “But with ‘Dream High 2,’ since I have done it all before, all that experience that I accumulated is a real boon. So, I believe that this series will turn out to be even more finished and complete as a work and I think that viewers can look forward to tuning in.”
From left to right: Park Jin-young, Kahi, Choi Yeo-jin and Kim Jung-tae attend the “Dream High 2” press conference Tuesday at the Imperial Palace Hotel in Seoul. (Lee Sang-sub/The Korea Herald)
Park revealed that when “Dream High” ended and the option of doing a second season was put on the table he really worried about whether or not he should do it. His primary concern was that young viewers loved the first installment so much that they might be disappointed by the sequel.
He also admitted that he had no idea what story to tell with a second season, that is, until autumn rolled around and he found his inspiration.
Of his role this time around, Park said, “In ‘Dream High 1’ my character experienced unrequited love.
“This time the situation changes a bit,” he said, hinting that his character will be luckier in love in the second season.
While Park remains a fixture of the series, the rest of the cast, however, has changed completely.
The first installment featured four JYPE singers, including boy band 2PM members Taec-yeon and Woo-young, along with hot property IU. First generation Hallyu star Bae Yong-joon also held a small role in the series.
The second installment is rolling out yet another eclectic mish-mash of K-pop idols.
Ballad-heavy male group 2AM’s Jeong Jin-woon, T-ara’s Ji-yeon (fellow member Ham Eun-jung starred in the first season), After School’s Kahi and SISTAR’s Hyo-rin will be starring in “Dream High 2.”
The entire cast, however, does not hail from the land of K-pop. “Sunny” actress Kang So-ra will be bringing her acting prowess to the series.
If the first installment’s premise was about a group of underdogs competing for a chance to become an international pop star, the sequel unfolds on a much larger scale, with the takeover of the art school by a major entertainment company. A flood of top idols enroll at the school, and art school veterans clash with these newcomers, leading to a battle between the two teams.
Though the plot and cast have changed, judging from the highlight reel that ran at the drama’s press conference in Seoul on Tuesday, it looks like the second season will retain the glitz, the bubble pop and dance-song heavy allure that made the first season so much fun to watch.
“Dream High 2” starts airing Jan. 30 on Monday and Tuesday nights at 9:55 p.m. on KBS 2 TV.

IU, 18, introduced her first composition in the official soundtrack of hit TV drama “The Greatest Love.” The song, “Hold My Hand,” was released through an online digital music site on Wednesday.

IU plans to further show off her talents as a singer-songwriter in her future albums. “IU has been practicing and learning how to write her own songs from the beginning of her debut. She’s very ambitious about it,” a person from IU’s agency said.
“We have a compilation of the songs she wrote with the help of composers and arrangers. We plan to distribute them through digital sources or include them on IU’s future albums.”
The new song, “Hold My Hand,” has a cheerful modern rock sound based on acoustic guitar with a band pitch-in. The song ranked first in the TOP 10 of popular music on the site it was released on.
IU’s new song is receiving attention amid the fervor for “I am a Singer,” a popular TV program where singers compete with other singers. Songs from the program have dominated the online charts.
IU debuted in 2008 with a mini album “Lost and Found.” She quickly rose to stardom through her appearances in hit entertainment shows and a teen TV drama. Her cute looks and powerful voice have gained her the nickname “the nation’s little sis.”

Figure champion Kim Yu-na debuted as an MC at her own figure-skating show on Sunday.
‘Kiss and Cry,’ the show featuring Kim as the new MC, is the first figure-skating variety show aired in Korea. On the show, 10 celebrities pair up with professional skaters to compete and to be judged by Kim Yu-na on their figure-skating performance. The first episode was aired Sunday, May 22.

“I wanted the public to know more about figure-skating and I wanted to get closer to the public through this program. That’s why I decided to appear on the show,” Kim said at an interview with the production crew. “I’ve been skating all my life but this is a new challenge,” she said.
The program’s title ‘Kiss and Cry’ was picked up from the ‘Kiss and Cry Zone’ which is a place at the stadium where skaters wait to receive their scores after their performance. “It’s the place that makes me most nervous,” Kim said, “even more nervous than when I’m skating.”
The show aired on SBS made a smooth debut with 12.4 percent ratings on the first day, exceeding that of ‘Happy Sunday- The Qualities of Man’ of KBS, the show aired by a rival broadcasting company during the same timeslot. ‘Happy Sunday- The Qualities of Man’ recorded 9.9 percent ratings.
Viewers made positive comments on the internet after the program. “The program showed us that figure-skating was not just a “pretty” sport, but also one that requires a lot of energy and effort,” one viewer said. “I like the fact that the show gives an opportunity for challenge to celebrities. It’s different from typical entertainment shows featuring celebrities,” another viewer said.
The show features celebrities such as comedian Kim Byung-man, singers U-Know Yunho, IU, and Son Dam-bi, speed skating gold medalist Lee Kyou-hyuk, and several other popular actors and singers.

When she arrived, though, the British singer-songwriter’s irresistible smile, conversation with the audience and unbeatably soulful voice instantly killed any complaints.
Performing her first solo concert in Seoul at Ax Hall on Thursday night, the 32-year-old appeared on stage wearing a black top, loose black pants and thin, flat golden shoes, about 30 minutes after K-pop idol IU sang two songs as the opening act.
You could hear grumbles like “why hasn’t the band checked the amps in advance” and “is Corinne at the airport?” among the audience.
However, shouting “I love Seoul,” Bailey Rae started off with “Are You Here” and the audience frantically cheered as if nothing that came before had really mattered.
Sophisticated and sweet vocals filled the mid-sized concert hall where the floor was packed with people standing.
She continued to rule the stage with “Paris Nights / New York Mornings,” “Closer,” “Love’s On It’s Way,” “Till It Happens To You” and “Paper Dolls.”
U.K. singer-songwriter Corinne Bailey Rae performs during her solo concert in Seoul on Thursday. (9 Entertainment)
The artist received more enthusiastic hurrahs when she performed Bob Marley’s “Is This Love.”
At each end of the song, Bailey Rae thanked the audience by saying “Gamsahamnida” (Thank You) with perfect Korean pronunciation.
The concert reached its climax when special guest IU made a surprise appearance on stage and joined Bailey Rae to do a duo for the famous song “Put Your Record On.” She immediately moved on to “Like a Star,” her 2005 debut single which brought her international stardom in 2006.
Audience members shouted “You are like a star” and “I love you more.”
She ended the concert with “The Sea,” but performed two encore songs, “Breathless” and Doris Day’s “Que Sera, Sera.”
The sessions ― drums, keyboards, bass and lead guitar ― were not bad but seemed a little bit lacking when it came to fine-tuning the amps and volume adjustments.
Bailey Rae has sold 4 million albums worldwide. The artist was nominated for the 2010 Mercury Prize for Album of the Year for “The Sea.”
