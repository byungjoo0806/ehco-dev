Netflix unveiled its 2025 content slate on Tuesday, promising a diverse lineup spanning TV series, films and entertainment shows.
The global streaming powerhouse detailed its strategic vision at the ""Next on Netflix 2025"" press event on Tuesday, emphasizing its commitment to genre-spanning storytelling.
""In the content industry, it's easy to fall into the temptation of repeating past successes. However, that is a trap. Neither viewers nor creators want to see or make the same thing over and over again. That’s why Netflix strives to take a different path,"" said Bela Bajaria, chief content officer at Netflix, in a statement released at the event.
""Netflix is not afraid to take bold risks because surprising audiences with new challenges is in our DNA. That’s why we boldly invest in stories that are distinctive, unique and even deeply Korean.""
Kang Dong-han, vice president of Korean content at Netflix, underscored the platform's global reach and expansive audience.
""Netflix recently announced that its number of subscriber households worldwide has surpassed 300 million,"" said Kang, during the event. ""Not only us, but other streaming services have also become incredibly popular.""
Kang explained Netflix has therefore strategically opted for a diverse content slate, ensuring a viewing experience that spans multiple genres.
Among the scripted highlights for 2025, ""Melo Movie,"" starring ""Parasite"" breakout Choi Woo-sik and Park Bo-young, is set to debut on Feb. 14. The romance drama follows a film director who falls for an aspiring filmmaker.
""When Life Gives You Tangerines,"" led by global superstars Lee Ji-eun (singer IU) and Park Bo-gum, premieres March 7, chronicling a romance set on Jeju Island.
The second quarter sees the arrival of ""Mercy for None,"" an adaptation of a widely celebrated crime noir webtoon headlined by veteran actor So Ji-sub, alongside ""Karma,"" and the hotly anticipated ""Weak Hero Class 2,"" an adaptation of a popular webtoon.
""Dear Hongrang,"" a period drama delving into a precarious relationship between Lee Jae-wuk and Cho Bo-ah, is set for a second-quarter release, as is the much-awaited ""Squid Game"" season three.
The third quarter will see the premiere of the romance drama ""Love Untangled"" and the series ""Aema,"" starring Lee Ha-nee, which explores the ascent of ""Madame Aema,"" an erotic film that was hugely popular in 1980s Korea. Also slated for the third quarter are the action-thriller ""Trigger"" and the character-driven drama ""You and Everything Else,"" starring Kim Go-eun.
In the fourth quarter, celebrated screenwriter Kim Eun-sook returns with ""Genie, Make a Wish,"" a romantic comedy featuring Bae Suzy and Kim Woo-bin.
Meanwhile, ""Can This Love Be Translated?,"" a romance drama starring Go Youn-jung and Kim Seon-ho, and ""The Price of Confession,"" a high-stakes thriller starring Kim Go-eun and Jeon Do-yeon, are set to close the year.
Netflix’s roster of films for 2025 includes acclaimed director Yeon Sang-ho's ""Revelation,"" a chilling horror-thriller starring Ryu Jun-yeol.
The platform will also launch its first Korean animated film, ""Lost in Starlight,"" while ""Wall to Wall,"" a suspense-driven thriller starring Kang Ha-neul, also joins the lineup.
Other upcoming films include ""Mantis,"" a spin-off of Netflix’s hit action film ""Kill Boksoon,"" and historical action-drama ""Good News,"" featuring Seol Kyung-gu and set against the backdrop of a 1970s hijacking.
The fourth quarter will see the arrival of ""The Great Flood,"" a disaster blockbuster starring Kim Da-mi and Park Hae-soo, alongside ""Cashero,"" an adaptation of the popular Kakao webtoon.
Netflix Korea, whose entertainment shows recently achieved breakout success, is returning with sequels to its major hits.
The streaming giant confirmed that star producer Na Young-suk will be spearheading a new Netflix entertainment series, though details on its premiere and format remain under wraps.
Adding to the entertainment show slate, the second season of ""The Devil’s Plan"" is confirmed for a second-quarter debut. Netflix revealed that the world-renowned Go master Lee Se-dol will participate in the new season of the reality game show.
The fourth quarter will introduce ""Physical: Asia,"" featuring contestants in an international physical showdown. Among the high-profile participants is the legendary Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao.
Meanwhile, the hit cooking survival competition ""Culinary Class Wars"" returns for season two in the fourth quarter, with original judges Paik Jong-won and Ahn Sung-jae returning to the show.
Netflix Korea further announced that the hit documentary show ""In the Name of God: A Holy Betrayal,"" which shook the nation in 2023, will return with a second season titled ""The Echoes of Survivors: Inside Korea’s Tragedies.""

Social media campaigns and boycotts have intensified, channeling public outrage in one of the world‘s most connected nations.
Singer IU, a K-pop singer and actor, has become a target of criticism from opponents of Yoon’s impeachment.
Her voluntary gesture of prepaying for food and hand warmers to support participants at a rally advocating for Yoon‘s impeachment has drawn significant criticism. Reports suggest that IU, along with other public figures, has been added to a “blacklist” allegedly compiled by Yoon’s supporters.
The “Yoon Suk Yeol Impeachment Support List” began circulating online last week, including IU and other celebrities, such as girl group NewJeans, filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, comedian Park Myung-soo and actor Go Ah-sung.
At the bottom of the image, it encourages reporting these individuals to the US Central Intelligence Agency, based on the spurious claim that being reported would prevent them from entering the United States.
One online user even posted a screenshot claiming to have reported IU to the CIA, urging others to participate in a “verification relay” by submitting similar reports.
The post, originally shared on the “People Power Party Gallery” of online forum DCInside, has since been deleted. Critics have dismissed the campaign as an embarrassing and absurd overreaction, with one commenter stating, “I don’t understand why people are resorting to such actions.”
Additionally, calls for boycotts against companies associated with IU have intensified. Lists of brands she has endorsement deals with, including Woori Bank and Hite Jinro, are being shared online with suggestions to stop buying products or services from the businesses.
On the other side, those supporting Yoon’s impeachment have launched a boycott against Purmil, a dairy company owned by the family of Rep. Yoon Sang-hyun’s wife.
Yoon Sang-hyun, a vocal opponent of the impeachment motion, has faced significant backlash. Critics accuse him and his family’s company of being complicit in insurrection, aligning their boycott with their broader political grievances.
Rep. Yoon, married to Shin Kyung-ah, a member of the family behind Purmil, has consistently opposed Yoon‘s impeachment.
On the day of the vote, he reaffirmed his stance, stating, “We cannot hand over power to the reckless Democratic Party led by Lee Jae-myung.”
His comments further fueled the campaign against Purmil.
Observers note that South Korea’s tendency to channel public sentiment into collective action has been magnified by social media. What begins as localized outrage can quickly escalate into nationwide campaigns, often fueled by misinformation, as seen with the CIA reporting claims, they said.
“Social media accelerates these dynamics,” said Choi Jong-ryul, a sociology professor at Keimyung University. “Outrage is no longer confined to political spheres -- it extends into cultural and economic realms, creating ripples that impact individuals and businesses alike.”

""IU can't go to America now,"" read the title of an anonymous post on DC Inside, with the writer accusing the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea of being ""secretly backed by China"" and claimed IU was ""actively supporting communist forces.""
The users on the controversial website encouraged others to follow suit, sharing a list of celebrities that publicly supported Yoon's impeachment. Some of them said that reporting the celebrities as spies would trigger investigations, making it difficult for them to visit or work in the US.

She made a striking entrance on a swing-like lift, dressed in a sparkling coral mini dress and a white headset, kicking off the show with “Holssi,” the first track from a captivating setlist that spanned over two hours. IU took an audience of 50,000 on a mesmerizing journey, performing “Ah Puh” amidst a stunning display of whale and jellyfish-shaped lanterns carried by dancers. While the open-air venue posed some challenges with sound delays that slightly detracted from the immersive experience, IU skillfully countered this with a variety of creative props and stage effects. The second section of the show began with a little girl awakening onstage, setting the scene for a magical moment when a star, carried by a drone, guided her to IU, who reappeared on the swing lift adorned with colorful flowers to sing “Celebrity.” She then flew over the venue to the stage front, where her fans, donning blue flower headpieces, surprised her during “Blueming.” “It’s wonderful to see you up close. Your affectionate gazes fill my heart with love. Thank you for this surprise event. I included this song just for this encore show,” IU said. She expressed her desire to perform “I Stan U” surrounded by her audience, adding, “Thank you for starting your autumn with my concert. Just as you cheer for me, I hope to be that kind of audience for you as well.” During the concert, IU also debuted a new song, “Bye Summer,” showcasing her skills on a crystal blue electric guitar. “This tour felt like summer lasted forever. However, I want to say it’s been the best summer because I shared it with all of you. This song feels fitting for a day that marks the end of summer,” she explained. The concert peaked with 1,000 drones illuminating the night sky during “Last Fantasy.” Dressed like a fairy tale princess wearing a flowing white gown and a crown, IU created a magical atmosphere enhanced by fireworks. A giant Tweety balloon, reminiscent of her “Shopper” music video, floated above as she performed the lead track from her latest EP ""The Winning."" As the concert drew to a close, IU reflected on the emotional weight of the moment. “This is the last moment of my world tour, and it makes me feel so sentimental. I hope you achieve victories, big and small, until we meet again,” she said, transitioning to “Love Wins All,” the final song on her setlist. Accompanied by an orchestra and a choir, her soulful performance left the audience mesmerized, inspiring clapping atypical of K-pop concerts.

But holding concerts at Seoul World Cup Stadium is being challenged by some soccer fans complaining that nonsports events there have crucial detrimental effects on the field. A self-proclaimed fan of Son Heung-min on Sept. 11 posted a petition on the state-run e-People website, calling for the cancellation of the K-pop superstar IU's concert slated for Sept. 21-22 in Seoul World Cup Stadium in Sangam-dong, Seoul. The petitioner claimed that the large crowd expected for the concert -- which sold out 100,000 tickets within minutes -- will damage the grass of the stadium that will be used for the qualifying matches of the upcoming 2026 World Cup. After playing Palestine on its home field on Sept. 5, South Korea will host the rest of its Group B opponents in the qualifiers slated until next year. But there have been multiple complaints from players, fans and even opposing teams about the poor conditions of the grass. ""A third-round qualifying match between South Korea and Iraq is slated in Sangam on Oct. 15, and (the authorities) should try their best to manage the grass there for remainder of (the World Cup qualifiers) period,"" the petitioner wrote. The person cited Seoul Metropolitan Government's Ordinance on the Installation and Operation of Seoul Sports Facilities, which in Article 5-3 states that the mayor may bar or even cancel use of a sports facility if they deem an event as possibly causing a hindrance to the management of the facility in question. Grass greener on other side The controversy started when national team captain Son-- who led his team's 3-1 road win over Oman with a go-ahead goal in the second half -- complained about the grass in the Seoul World Cup Stadium. He said the Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex's field being in good condition allowed him to play with more confidence, adding that he wishes such good management could be applied to Korea's home fields as well. After his team ended in a goalless draw against Palestine in Seoul, he claimed the grass had made things difficult for him to control the ball. The allegedly questionable grass conditions at the Seoul World Cup Stadium have long been an issue here. Former national team player Ki Sung-yueng in 2017 jokingly said that he was not worried about a road match in China, because the grass there ""could not possibly be worse than in Seoul."" In light of the concerns over grass, Seoul Facilities Corporation in October 2021 installed new turf comprised of 95 percent natural and 5 percent synthetic grass. Fewer events were held at the stadium since then compared to before, with the venue being concert-free for a full year since the new field was installed. But between the ongoing remodeling of the Seoul Olympic Main Stadium in Jamsil, southern Seoul and the Gocheok Sky Dome being occupied for the professional baseball league season, the World Cup Stadium has become virtually the only venue in Seoul to hold mega-sized concerts. The concerts of band Seventeen and singer Lim Young-woong were held in the stadium, each in April and May of this year, prior to the upcoming IU concert. Operators of the Seoul World Cup Stadium told the local media that warnings about the grass are notified to whoever rents the stadium, and those who rent it are mandated to restore any damages to the field. Grass access is also limited to the minimum number of personnel required to install the stage and conduct the events, they added. The performers themselves also make efforts to minimize damage to the grass, such as Lim not installing seats on the field. IU's agency also vowed to follow the policies by protecting the grass, disassembling the stage as soon as the concert ends, while keeping the grass hydrated and well-ventilated during the event. With concerns over the grass conditions in Sangam, the Korea Football Association is mulling whether to select a different venue for upcoming home matches. The officials, however, said player convenience should be considered in any potential change of venue, and vowed to come up with a solution as soon as possible before the next match in October. South Korea is currently playing to earn one of two direct World Cup berths allocated for the Group B teams in the third round of the Asian Qualifiers. The team will face off against Iraq on Oct. 15 at home on the as yet undecided field. If the country fails to finish in the top two of its group, it will compete in the fourth round for a spot in the inter-confederation playoffs.",iu,4.0,"The article directly mentions IU and discusses her upcoming concert at Seoul World Cup Stadium, which relates to her work as a singer-songwriter.

""Finding a venue is like finding a needle in a haystack,"" said an official from a music festival organizing agency. The official added that many performances that were originally scheduled for December to target the year-end are being pushed to January due to the shortage of venues. Another industry insider also commented on the severe shortage of performance venues. ""It is true that Seoul lacks big concert venues. While international artists often prefer larger venues, they have no choice but to perform in smaller, available spaces to fit their schedules."" The Music Concert Industry Association of Korea, established in March 2021 by 46 entertainment agencies and concert planning companies, announced last week it has launched a petition drive to address the shortage of performance venues in Seoul. The petition aims to pressure the government and the city of Seoul to establish temporary concert venues in the metropolitan area. The association proposes the creation of an integrated task force involving the government, city, sports industry and cultural sector to come up with solutions to the venue shortage issue. Are there really no large-scale concert venues in Korea? One of Seoul's most prominent large-scale venues, Jamsil Olympic Stadium – which can accommodate up to some 60,000 people – will not be able to function as a concert hall for the next few years. Starting in 2027, it will serve as an alternative venue for Jamsil Baseball Stadium, which is set to undergo expansion until 2031. Seoul World Cup Stadium in Sangam-dong, northwestern Seoul, which can hold up to 66,000 people, is primarily a dedicated soccer stadium, making it difficult to secure for concerts. Only a few artists, such as Lim Young-woong, Seventeen and IU, have managed to book the venue. Even when successful, they have faced criticism over potential damage to the soccer field. Other frequently used venues include the 15,000-seat KSPO Dome, originally a gymnastics venue for the 1988 Seoul Olympics, and the 20,000-seat Gocheok Sky Dome, Korea's first enclosed dome baseball stadium. The Olympic Hall, a popular music-specific concert venue located in Olympic Park in eastern Seoul, has only 3,000 seats, while the adjacent SK Handball Gymnasium can accommodate up to 5,000 people. In comparison to Japan, which has five venues with over 30,000 seats and more than 40 venues with more than 10,000 seats, Korea's concert venue infrastructure falls far short in both size and number. The emergence of global idol groups and popular trot singers has resulted in massive fan bases that can fill large concert venues, but the growing demand for more venues has been unmet. This lack of large concert venues has led to some top international artists -- including Taylor Swift -- to skip South Korea on their world tours. Additionally, since most large concert venues here are primarily sports facilities, government and sporting events are given priority, leaving very few dates available for concerts. ""The size of the venue is a measure of an artist's capability, but right now, Korean artists have no way to gauge their popularity beyond the 18,000-seat KSPO Dome,"" the insider explained. ""It would be great if there were venues for artists who attract between 20,000 and 50,000 fans,"" the insider further noted, pointing out the lack of a venue between the 18,000-capacity KSPO Dome and 60,000-capacity World Cup Stadium. The official added that using a sports facility as a concert venue requires significant preparation and investment. ""I understand that some sports stadiums overseas are designed to be easily converted into concert venues, with features like reversible surfaces to protect the turf and better sound equipment. However, since we perform in sports stadiums that weren't built with these considerations in mind, the cost of preparing for a concert is much higher."" Is construction the solution? Meanwhile, some argue that building large-scale venues is not the only solution. Pop music critic Lim Hee-yun pointed out that while the demand for concerts has indeed increased, the key question is whether this demand will be sustained in the future. ""It is true that there has been a significant rise in the number of festivals, concerts and international artists' tours, leading to a shortage of venues. However, constructing new venues requires substantial budget and given the uncertainty about future demand, careful consideration is necessary,"" Lim said. Lim referred to the recently failed K-Culture Valley project in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, highlighting the risks associated with large-scale venue projects. The K-Culture Valley project aimed to build a cutting-edge large-scale concert hall and studio on a 237,000-square-meter lot, approximately the size of 46 soccer fields, in Goyang, just outside Seoul. However, CJ LiveCity, the project developer, halted construction in April 2023 and its contract with Gyeonggi Province was terminated in July of this year, effectively ending the project. ""As K-pop grew explosively, there were numerous plans for arena venues. Local governments showed interest and invested in these projects. But we have started to see cases where these plans fizzled out. Ultimately, the most feasible option is to make use of existing venues,"" Lim assessed. Ilsan's Kintex and the Goyang Sports Complex are examples of existing venues being used for concerts. One of the most prominent venues, KSPO Dome, initially criticized for its inadequate sound system, has become a more fitting venue after remodeling and various improvements. This suggests that developing and enhancing existing facilities could also be a viable solution. Lim further emphasized the need to consider multipurpose spaces, noting that many overseas venues serve both as concert halls and sports facilities. ""Wembley Stadium in London is used both as a soccer stadium and a concert venue, and SoFi Stadium in LA serves as an NFL stadium and a concert venue. Globally iconic venues often have multipurpose functions, combining sports events with concerts.""",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU specifically but only briefly, noting her as one of the few artists who managed to book Seoul World Cup Stadium for concerts.

The district became popular for its Itaewon neighborhood -- where people can experience and enjoy a variety of international cultures -- many years ago. It also beckons history buffs with the National Museum of Korea and the War Memorial of Korea. Today, it is easy to spot young, vibrant K-pop fans near Sinyongsan Station, where the headquarters of Hybe, the K-pop powerhouse behind BTS, are located. Meanwhile, “Yongnidan-gil,” a cluster of streets between Samgakji Station and Sinyongsan Station, is a hot spot among Koreans wanting to take Instagrammable photos and spend quality time with their friends. But, for those who feel exploring these sites is not enough, a five to six-minute walk from Yongsan-gu’s iconic shopping complex, HDC IPark Mall, takes you to Baekbin Railroad Crossing where you can experience a uniquely retro vibe. This railroad crossing was heavily featured in the mega-hit drama series “My Mister” (2018). The two lead characters -- a senior supervisor of a company Park Dong-hoon (played by the late Lee Sun-kyun) and his teammate Lee Ji-ahn (played by IU) -- who lived in same neighborhood, often ran into each other there on their commute to work. Though Baekbin Railroad Crossing, surrounded by old-fashioned shops, low-rise buildings and houses, is an interesting place during the day, its true charms are revealed once the sun sets. At night, red traffic lights, flashy head lamps and LED signs light up the narrow alleys. As one of the few remaining railroad crossings in Seoul, even some of its smallest details, from the crossbuck to the barriers and alarm bell attached to a mast, catch the eyes of drama fans and travelers alike. This crossing road is also known as “Ttaeng Ttaeng Street,” after the sound of the train bell. “I really find this railroad crossing special, because you can easily feel the retro vibe in central Seoul. The contrast between the skyscrapers and the nearby old-fashioned houses seems interesting to me. It is certainly a cool place to take some memorable photos,” a 25-year-old university student surnamed Park told The Korea Herald on Tuesday. While taking a light stroll around the area, visitors can see office workers having their “hoesik,” or after-work get-together, in the nearby restaurants just like the characters in “My Mister.” If you wish to enjoy Jeju’s renowned black pork cuts, head over to Childonga for dinner. You can also try some unique “hansik,” or Korean cuisine, like beef tartare bibimbap at JipJip. If you are not a big fan of a gastronomic journey, head over to the IPark Mall’s colorful outdoor plaza or RM Forest No. 2 at the nearby Han River Park before calling it a day.

Korea to crack down on ticket scalping via macro tools,2024-03-18,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2024/03/18/20240318050521_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"The South Korean government said Monday that the recent law revision banning the use of macro tools to buy tickets will take effect Friday as part of its measures to fight widespread ticket scalping in the country. The revision of the Public Performance Act specifies that no one shall illegally buy tickets for performances by using computer programing tools for automated repetitive inputs -- the macro programs -- for the purpose of reselling them, according to the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism. Those guilty of violation could be subject to up to one year in prison or a 10 million won ($7,500) fine. ""Ticket scalping threatens the basis of the market order for our culture and sports, and we (the ministry) will take severe actions against it. ... The Culture Ministry will implement various policies that can root out and prevent ticket scalping, thus restoring the order in the distribution system of culture and sports fields,"" the Culture Ministry Yu In-chon said. Since March 2, the ministry has been operating a webpage exclusively devoted to reports related to illegal ticket sales (www.culture.go.kr/singo), which allows users to report such acts online or via phone while providing options to apply for legal consultation. It plans to work closely with the cybercrime division of the National Police Agency to crack down on the ticket scalping. The ministry also plans to hold continued meetings with those in the fields of culture and sports to discuss countermeasures against illegal ticket sales, starting with a meeting Monday at the National Theater of Korea with officials from major theaters and performance agencies across the country. Ticket scalping in South Korea has been an ongoing problem -- especially in the era of digital ticketing -- with the damages from the illegal act said to be substantial. In an interview with The Korea Herald last year, Yoon Dong-hwan, the chair of the Record Label Industry Association of Korea, said that more than 50 percent of the tickets from sold-out performances typically go to scalpers. Yoon's claim is not backed up by an official tally, but statistics do make it clear that ticket scalping in the country is on the rise. According to the Korea Creative Content Agency, the number of reports related to illegal ticket sales went from 359 in 2020 to 4,224 in 2022. A survey by the RLIAK in 2023 showed that 32.8 percent of those aged between 19 and 29 have bought a ticket from a scalper at least once, followed by 25 percent of those in their 30s and 40s. Singers across the country have been attempting to fight such illegal actions in various ways. K-pop megastar IU slaps a life-time ban from her fan club on anyone caught illegally selling a ticket to her concert, and singer Jang Beom-jun implemented a system of selling tickets as non-fungible tokens for last months' performance. Many others have a no-warning policy for canceling tickets suspected of being reserved by a ticket scalper. The revision of the performance law follows complaints that ticket scalping via bots had remained in a legal blind spot since legal punishment for such acts had only been stipulated in a law introduced half a century ago. Prior to the revision, illegal sales of tickets were only punishable by the Article 3 of the Punishment for Minor Offense Act, which does not address online sales.",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU specifically, but only briefly as an example of artists fighting ticket scalping by banning scalpers from her fan club.

Reminiscent of dandelion spores, IU appeared from the ceiling wearing a glittering headset and slowly descended toward the stage, silently surrounded by her audience. When she landed on the stage to perform “Holssi,” meaning spore in Korean, the lights shone on the stage and spread outwards like petals, transforming like a blooming flower. “Today the venue seems to be hotter than usual. I know the weather is getting warm but I think it’s your energy that is creating this heat,” said IU. The artist’s show was divided into five parts, each with a different theme. IU charmed the nearly 14,000-strong audience during the first ""hypnotic"" part of the show. Then, a little girl wearing a white dress and holding a lantern appeared on stage as it filled with fog. The girl wandered around, lost in the woods until a golden path appeared in front of her, at the end of which stood IU. IU proceeded to perform “Celebrity” which seemed to tell the little girl, who symbolized the singer's listeners, that even though she feels lost at the moment, she will soon find her way to achieve her dream. “Now, I’m going to sing ‘Blueming’ for which I want you to put down your cameras and phones, and focus on this moment with me,” IU asked her fans. The singer's fans sang along with the artists, almost as if they had practiced it beforehand. “The next song is ‘I stan U,’ and I wrote this song thinking about you guys. I wanted to tell you that just as you cheer for me on stage, I also hope to be that kind of audience for you,” the artist said, expressing her affection toward her fans. “I also have this special fan light designed just for me. Don’t forget that, whenever life is harsh to you, IU is cheering for you with this fan light.” During the last of her four concerts at the KSPO Dome in Seoul, actor Park Bo-geum was invited to the stage as a guest performer. “He is a dear friend of mine who is not a singer but sings just as well as a singer and is unbelievably handsome,” said IU as she introduced Park to her fans. IU became friends with the actor while shooting the Netflix series “When Life Gives You Tangerines” last year. Park performed IU’s “Not Spring, Love, or Cherry Blossoms” and Jukjae’s “Let’s Go See the Stars.” Guest artists at the singer's first three concerts were NewJeans, Riize and Le Sserafim. IU transformed the mood by performing her ballad “Through the Night,” immersing her fans in a mellow and cozy atmosphere. “I think this song will be included in all of the set lists for my future concerts. That’s how much I love this song and it’s so soothing when we sing it together. I hope this moment comes to your mind before you go to sleep,” said the artist. The concert hit its climax when IU performed “Shopper,” the lead track of her latest EP, “The Winning.” The sound of the audience singing along to the artist was deafening. Tweety Bird, the famous yellow canary character from the animated cartoon, “Looney Tunes,” with whom IU collaborated to promote her new album, appeared on the screens around IU, making it seem as if the character was performing on stage alongside the singer.

The new EP was released Tuesday. On the day of her new album release, IU posted a video on her official YouTube channel in which, sitting down on a couch, she introduces her album as if talking to a friend. “I decided to live as a spore. I was inspired by the word 'spore' when making this album,” said IU.

But now that I’m 30 years old, I rather accept the fact that I could live as a spore, but do my best to live an awesome life as a spore.

Even though others might judge your dream as weird, there is no reason for you to limit your aspiration,” IU said.

Ticket scalping has long been an issue ailing the local music industry, with a Record Label Industry Association of Korea survey showing that 32.8 percent of those aged 19-29 have bought a ticket from a scalper at least once. The group suspects that about half of the tickets for sold-out performances go to ticket scalpers. South Korea recently revised the Public Performance Act to specify that buying tickets with targeted software -- or macros -- is illegal. But there have been calls for a more comprehensive revision to stop the illegal ticket sales, most of which occur online and have long been in a legal blind spot as the related law was passed 50 years ago.",iu,3.0,"The article does specifically mention IU and discusses her approach to combating ticket scalping at her concerts by implementing a fan club ban system.

The drama series' last episode logged a viewership rating of 12.4 percent, according to Nielson Korea, breaking its 15th episodes' viewership rating record of 10.4 percent. ""Boyhood,"" a 10-part drama series which exclusively aired on Coupang Play from Nov. 24, 2023 to Dec. 22, 2023, also gained popularity, depicting the coming-of-age story of Jang Byung-tae (played by Im Si-wan), a high school student from Buyeo, South Chungcheong Province.

Pop culture critic Jeong Ji-wook said constant releases of drama series focusing on the lives of young people in regions other than Seoul follows the growing demand of audiences for stress relief. ""Following the outbreak of the pandemic, people here were very stressed. When everything became hard and it wasn't clear what to do or how to solve anything (content creators) attempted to offer some kind of 'healing code.'

The hashtag has since been used to commemorate the victory of marriage equality. “If there is a word that is exactly the opposite to the message of the single, it would be ‘hatred.’ We sincerely hope that all love will win in a world without hate, and that the meaning of this song will be conveyed without hurting anyone,” the agency added. “Love Wins All,” set for release on Jan. 24, is a much-anticipated single featuring V of BTS.

And the star-studded cast including Park Seo-joon and IU and approachable plot based on the real-life event 2012 World Homeless World cup added expectations for a strong comeback. The plot rolls along quickly for the first 20 minutes, showing how Hong-dae (Park), a hot-tempered former soccer player, ended up coaching a group of homeless men who have never played soccer before. But after a promising set-up, “Dream” fails to maintain its grip on the audience's attention for the rest of its 126 minutes. Like many other sports films, it falls into the trap of portraying the underdogs’ stories too dramatically. Lee told reporters during a press conference that this film was particularly difficult as it was a project from long ago. He was also keen to cover homelessness issues carefully. The film is being released eight years after it was conceived. ""I felt it was like a mission for me to resolve bias against (homeless people) and also felt like a homework to find the middle point to not to comically depict that part,” Lee said, adding that he is also curious about how the audience would view his new film. The so-called ""Lee Byeong-heon clique” -- Heo Joon-seok, Kim Jong-soo, Yang Hyun-min, Jung Seung-kil, Lee Hae-woon and Hong Wan-pyo -- does this pretty well. As with his previous hits “Extreme Job” and “Melo is My Nature,” Lee provides them with realistic lines and character buildup without exaggeration, and the actors make good use of the material, with naturalistic depictions of their characters. The trouble seems to start with the two lead actors, both working with Lee for the first time. Park struggles to show his usual flair, and IU is lumbered with a role that doesn't play to her strengths. “Dream” was shot before Hirokazu Kore-eda's award-winning “Broker,” so in a way, this is her first-ever film. Her transition to the silver screen was a natural one after successful TV roles in “My Mister” (2018) and “Hotel del Luna” (2019). But her role as a documentary producer Lee So-min, who follows Hong-dae’s team on its journey to the Homeless World Cup in Hungary, is a poor fit. It does not help that her presence is diminished toward the end of the film, when So-min could have become a more multi-dimensional character and added spice to what, by then, is a flagging storyline. “Dream” opens in theaters on April 26.",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU specifically and discusses her role in the film ""Dream,"" which is relevant to her work as an actress. However, the article is somewhat critical of her performance and role fit, noting it's ""a poor fit"" and that her character becomes diminished.

The film tells the story of a Yoon Hong-dae (Park Seo-joon), a professional football player-turned-coach who is put on disciplinary probation after becoming involved in an unexpected incident and tasked with coaching the South Korean national soccer team for the Homeless World Cup. “There was not too much to think about in deciding to make Homeless World Cup into the film, specifically the year 2010 when the Korean team debuted in the competition, because the purpose of this event was very meaningful,” director Lee Byeong-heon told reporters during a press conference held in Megabox Seongsu in Seoul on Thursday. “The competition was created to break the social bias against vulnerable social groups such as alcohol abusers, and the film also contains that message, as well as joy as a comedy film.” He added that it took more than 10 years to finally bring the film to audiences. “When ‘Extreme Job’ became a hit, I felt relieved to finally be able to make this film (in terms of both investment and preparation),” said Lee. Park said to look and act like a professional soccer player, he worked on bulking up and went through intensive training sessions.

While all IU concerts are special, “The Golden Hour” was historic in another sense, as it marked her debut at Olympic Stadium, one of the nation’s biggest and most-coveted concert venues. The 30-year-old has done that as the first Korean female soloist. It also marked her first offline gig in three years, since “Love, Poem” in 2019. As the night opened with “Eight,” IU appeared on the stage clad head-to-toe in white. She performed “Celebrity” and danced around the stage, moving to the thrust platform that extended into the floor seats. “It’s full again tonight,” IU said, to which some 40,000 fans erupted in cheers. “It’s a little bit hotter than yesterday, but fortunately, the sky was prettier today. I wanted to sing ‘Eight’ with the sunset. It was something I had planned for a long time,” she said. ""I’m happy that it turned out as pretty as I expected."" IU then kicked into her classics with “dlwlrma,” “Every End of the Day” and “Friday.” During “The Meaning of You,” fans joined in, taking turns with IU.

On Sept. 18, 2008, IU began her career with her first EP, “Lost and Found.” With joys came sorrows, as the night bid a farewell to the much-loved “Palette” and “Good Day.” “I made this song when I was 25 and have sang it until now, cherishing it inside me. But I turned into my 30s (by Korean age), and I want to now leave the song to 25-year-old Jieun,” she said about “Palette,” adding the song will not be included in future official concert set lists. “Good Day” brought IU her first commercial breakout in 2010 and has continued to represent the singer for a long time, and she said she is now putting the song behind her to bring some fresher tunes into the rotation. Plenty of visual surprises, from fireworks to drone shows, were in store. During “Strawberry Moon,” IU appeared on a pink hot-air balloon shaped stage and traveled around the stadium, getting closer to the audience in the upper floors.

Along with the dance team Holy Bang, the rapper performed a duet of “Ganadara” with IU. “Although she’s much younger, IU is an artist I truly respect,” he said. “She’s stayed at the top for 14 years, pulling off everything perfectly, from her albums to acting and even the concerts, It’s more amazing for me as, as a fellow musician, I know how much hard work and effort it takes to do that.” IU toned down the mood and removed herself of the glistening glamour in the third part of the night. As she began crooning the lyrics of “Knees,” the hall dimmed. A roar of applause burst from the crowd after the song ended. She continued unrestrained, straight into “Winter Sleep.” “'Knees’ is a song that I think defines myself as a musician, and I wanted to sing the song on this stage even though it’s now so well known. ‘Winter Sleep,’ which followed, is a song that I wrote trying to find that emotions I’d felt when I had written ‘Knees.’ The two are like a set for me,” IU explained, adding it was her first time sharing her thoughts about the two songs. IU went on to softly coo “Night Letter” and “Only I Didn’t Know.” The night took a majestic turn with “Above the Time,” as a drone show began with the backdrop of roaring orchestral sounds. Drones flew up in unison into the night sky and made a silhouette of IU in “Celebrity.” They then moved around to draw an hourglass, the symbolic shape of “The Golden Hour.” Ending the official set list with her ""You & I,” IU was welcomed back to the stage by fans with “Love, Poem.” It was the first song of her encore, but fans gifted her with their own sing-along. “I will stand by your every step as we are perfect friends of 14 years,” read a placard held up by fans. Before wrapping up the night with “My Sea,” IU opened up about the uncertainties she had felt as she waited three years to finally hold the concert. “I really didn’t believe that this moment would come, but it has. I’ve spent the past two months worrying that some issue will come up and it might not happen, so it feels incredible that this moment has finally come,” IU said. It wasn’t just the pandemic that had troubled her. IU said she has been struggling with hearing issues as well. “It’s not something serious, but I haven’t been able to control my ear conditions for around a year now,” she began. “Near the end of yesterday’s show, my ears started to worsen in condition, and from last night until the rehearsal today, the past day has been like hell for me.” “I stepped onto the stage today not knowing what to do, but truly, you guys did everything for today’s show,” she said, thanking fans sincerely. Debuting as a girl at the age of 15, IU has grown into one of the most loved and respected artists over the past 14 years. What has brought her such big love, from listeners young and old, male and female, is not just her musical talents, but the humbleness that she has maintained. IU again moved many hearts with her words. “I thought that this show might be my final destination. I had never imagined being on such a big stage,” she said. “Through tonight’s memory, I will not become arrogant and, staying humble, I will keep on reminding myself about those hearts rooting for me. I’ve only come 14 years, so here’s to another 14 years.”",iu,5.0,"The article is entirely about IU (아이유), focusing on her 14th anniversary concert ""The Golden Hour"" and her career as a singer-songwriter.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2881960,‘Broker’ director Kore-eda aims to break prejudice against mothers who give up kids,2022-06-06,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/06/06/20220606000115_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda’s new film “Broker” does not hide the key question that the director wants to ask the audience: Should mothers take all the blame for abandoning their children in “baby boxes”? “At the beginning of the movie, Soo-jin (played by Bae Doo-na) says ‘if you are going to abandon a newborn, you should not have given a birth to him.’ This shows that there is a kind of prejudice toward mothers. The film starts from there,” the director said during an interview with a group of local reporters at a cafe in Samcheong-dong, central Seoul. “The film shows how much Soo-jin’s prejudice changed.” Kore-eda said he found out about the prejudice while talking with a man who grew up in an orphanage that had harbored some resentment toward his mother.  “He said he had contemplated the question: Did my mom want me to be born?” Kore-eda said. It was at that moment that it occurred to Kore-eda that the blame should not be solely on mothers, and that society should also share the responsibility. Kore-eda’s “Broker” centers on relationships formed through baby boxes installed at churches or institutions in Korea where desperate parents can leave their newborns anonymously. The fictional story begins with So-young (IU) leaving her baby in a box in front of a church. Sang-hyun (Song Kang-ho) and Dong-soo (Kang Dong-won) secretly steal the baby to sell him to a family who cannot legally adopt. So-young, who returns to the church the next day to retrieve the baby, finds out that Sang-hyun and Dong-soo have taken her child. Soon, So-young and the two men are looking for the right parents for the baby. Meanwhile, police officer Soo-jin is investigating the two men. The 60-year-old director said he heard negative feedback on some lines that were deemed “too direct” in conveying another underlying theme of cherishing life, such as a scene when So-young says, “Thank you for coming into this world,” to everyone in the room. But this was intentional, he emphasized. “I also strongly believed that my film should look at every human’s life positively,” he said. During the interview, the Japanese director also revealed how he created the framework of the new film. “I created this film with three boxes,” Kore-eda said. “The first box is the smallest one that the baby is being abandoned in, and then the second box is the van that brokers in the film travel in with the baby. The last box is symbolic and invisible -- the society that surrounds the baby.” Since Kore-eda cannot speak Korean, he noted that he got some help from veteran actor Song. Kore-eda highlighted that there was a particular moment when the star impressed him the most during this process. “Song Kang-ho suggested cutting out some of the lines that his character says. I tried cutting it out accordingly and it was indeed a whole lot better. But it is really rare for an actor to ask the director to cut out his own lines. In fact, it was the first time,” he said. “That was when I realized that Song Kang-ho is the actor that truly cares about creating a better film.” Kore-eda also shared his recent participation in the 75th Cannes Film Festival at which Song won the best actor award for his role in “Broker.” “It is the eighth time that I was invited to Cannes and every time it is different,” he said. “The most evident difference that I have noticed this time was that there were billboards for ‘Broker’ everywhere, which made me realize the power of CJ ENM. I was proud, but at the same time it was a lot of pressure seeing the poster of my work hung at the hotel I am staying at. I did take photos with it though,” Kore-eda said jokingly. When asked to talk about the decline of the Japanese film industry in the global standing, Kore-eda carefully said that he did not want to compare the current situation with the heyday of the Japanese film industry. “It is the same with the Italian and French film industries, there can be ups and downs, so I do not take it as a negative phenomenon,” Kore-eda said. “But it is true that the Japanese film industry is stagnant when looking at it from an outsider’s perspective. I know that there are a lot of talented actors and creators who are willing to do something fun. I think it is the old production environment that is making them difficult to take on challenges. There is not enough capital to develop something new so original works are rare. There are things that I learned while working in Korea and France. I learned what we have to work on, so I want to go back to Japan and make some improvements.” Kore-eda worked with French actors and staff for his previous project, “The Truth.”  “Broker” hits local theaters Wednesday.",iu,4.0,"The article directly mentions IU as an actress in the film ""Broker,"" where she plays the role of So-young, a mother who leaves her baby in a baby box.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2879345,Director Kore-eda says Song Kang-ho inspired him to make ’Broker‘,2022-06-01,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/06/01/20220601000115_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Actor Song Kang-ho recalled what it was like to receive the best actor award at the 75th Cannes Film Festival, a first for a Korean male, during a press conference for the film held Tuesday, just a day after returning from France. “Very few get to receive awards at Cannes. Only seven out of 21 movies (in competition) get awards. Before midnight, those seven films get a notice that they will receive awards. So I was really nervous before midnight,” Song said during the press conference held at CGV Yongsan in central Seoul. “It is hard to recall the exact moment when my name was announced. I think I panicked and had a bizarre feeling and also was very happy.” Song added that the first text messages he received after getting the award were from director Bong Joon-ho in London and director Kim Ji-hoon in Korea. “They were watching the awards ceremony on YouTube. I received so many congratulatory messages and so much praise. I want to continue to enjoy them bit by bit,” Song joked. Director Hirokazu Kore-eda also shared what it was like to watch Song receive the top actor prize. “I am a little cynical, so when people praise my work I think about which part was good and can never enjoy their praise. But when my actors receive praise, I can truly enjoy it and be happy,” the director said. “Japanese reporters also told me that I looked happier than usual.” The Japanese director added to the praises for Song’s performance. “I think Song won the award not because I did something right; it was due to the accumulation of all the work that he has done. I could not believe that he had not received any awards previously,” he said. “If he had received the award earlier for appearing in director Bong Joon-ho’s work or director Lee Chang-dong’s work, nobody would have thought that he did not deserve it. I feel sorry that he is receiving it (belatedly) with my project, and I am so happy. It is the best award that my movie ‘Broker’ can receive.” Kore-eda’s “Broker” centers on relationships formed through “baby boxes” installed at churches or institutions in Korea where desperate parents can leave their newborns anonymously. The film begins with So-young (played by IU) leaving her baby in front of a baby box at a church. Sang-hyun (played by Song) and Dong-soo (played by Kang Dong-won) secretly steal the baby to sell him to a family who cannot adopt legally. So-young who returns to the church the next day finds out that Sang-hyun and Dong-soo have taken her baby. Soon, So-young and the two men are looking for the rights parents for the baby. Meanwhile, a cop, Soo-jin (Bae Doo-na), follows the two men and nabs them as they are about to make an illegal deal with potential parents. During the conference, the Japanese director talked about what it was like to work with Korean actors. “I am sure actors had concerns since I do not speak Korean. In order to solve that problem, I tried communicating with them as much as possible. Before shooting the film, I gave them a hand-written letter. Once we started filming, we tried having a deep conversation. Also, Song Kang-ho gave me feedback after watching the roughly edited version each day,” the director said. The director also went on and talked about how Song inspired him to make the movie. “A scene of Song Kang-ho gently talking to a baby in the baby box and also selling babies came to my mind. I thought about Song playing a character that has both good and evil sides and that’s where I started from,” he said. He discovered about baby boxes while working on other projects. “When I was filming ‘Like Father, Like Son’ in Japan, I did a lot of different research about adoption and found out that there is a baby box in Kumamoto. Then I found out that there are baby boxes in Korea as well. According to statistics, the number of babies that are placed in baby boxes in Korea is over 10 times greater than the number in Japan.” He said. Korean heartthrob Kang talked in greater detail about his character and how he prepared for it during the press conference. “Dong-soo is from an orphanage and is also a partner of Sang-hyun who steals babies for adoption. Before filming the scenes, I had a conversation with people who used to live in orphanages. The most impressive thing for me was when they told me about how the children would get their hopes up when they heard a car come in, thinking that someone might be there to take them home. I thought that my character Dong-soo also waited for his mother like them,” he said. “Dong-soo is also a man who believes that children should grow up in a family and not at an orphanage. He also probably had some resentment (toward his mom). And realizes through So-young that his mother could have had reasons for not coming back to get him.” The singer-turned-actor IU, also known as Lee Ji-eun, talked about a difficult scene that she had to perform. “Since the director is Japanese, the script had swear words that did not seem natural for Koreans. So I asked if I could add some Korean swear words and the director allowed me to change it freely,” she said.” This is the first time I‘ve performed lines with swear words. So I practiced them a lot at home and was very nervous before filming.” “I always thought that Lee Ji-eun was a great actor but I did not know that she would pull off the scene so well,” Song said. “Another scene that I really liked was when they (Sang-hyun and Dong-soo) hop onto a van after failing to find the right parents. Sang-hyun and Dong-so do not know what to do in that scene and speak gibberish, and, just at that moment, she (IU) kicks the front seat. That was not in the script so I was really surprised and could perform a realistic reaction,” Song said.

Park Chan-wook won best director for “Decision to Leave” and Song Kang-ho won best actor for “Broker” at Cannes on Saturday. Some local film critics predicted that CJ ENM could sell as many tickets as it did pre-pandemic in 2019 with the two films. “Since I have not seen the film yet it is hard to predict, but ‘Broker’ has Song Kang-ho and many strong points as a commercial film so I expect to be successful (at the box office),” film critic Jung Ji-wook said. Culture critic Ha Jae-keun was a bit more cautious but believed the films would have a good start. “The recent trend has been that just because films won some awards at a big film festival, does not automatically mean the films can attract moviegoers. I think success will depend on actual moviegoers’ reviews,” Ha said. “But since the two films got a lot of attention from the media, it will help attract audiences in the beginning.” CJ ENM will release “Broker“ on June 8 and release “Decision to Leave” three weeks later, on June 29. So far, three films in which CJ ENM has invested and holds distributions rights to have won at the Cannes Film Festival, including Bong Joon-ho’s “Parasite,” which won the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 2019. “Parasite,” which was released after winning the Palme d’Or, sold 10.31 million tickets. Sales at CJ ENM’s film business increased by 63.8 percent to 349.3 billion won ($281.65 million) and its operating profit reached 43.6 billion won.  Meanwhile, the two films -- “Decision to Leave” and “Broker” -- have been performing well in the global film market. “Decision to Leave” has been sold to 192 countries, which is close to the record held by “Parasite,” which was sold to 205 countries. “Broker” has been sold to 171 countries. Park’s new movie centers on a polite and honest police officer named Hye-jun (Park Hye-il). Hye-jun looks into a suspicious death that occurred on a mountain and comes to suspect the dead man’s wife, the mysterious Seo-rae (Tang Wei). At the same time, Hye-jun becomes attracted to her. “Broker” features a cast of famous Korean actors, including Song, Bae Doo-na, Gang Dong-won and IU, and centers around the relationships formed through a “baby box,” a box installed at churches or institutions where desperate parents can leave their newborns anonymously.",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU briefly as part of the cast of ""Broker,"" which is relevant to her work as an actress.

South Korea took home two major titles -- Park Chan-wook won best director for “Decision to Leave” and Song Kang-ho won best actor for “Broker” – at the 75th Cannes Film Festival that ended Saturday. Park’s thriller-romance film, “Decision to Leave,” about a detective who comes across a widow who is a prime suspect in his murder investigation, stars Korean actor Park Hae-il and Chinese actor Tang Wei. In accepting his award, Park expressed gratitude to fans for going to theaters and looked forward to a bright future for cinema. “With the dreadful pandemic, there were times when we struggled due to the theaters closing down, but at the same time, we all realized how precious the existence of theaters had been to us. I am confident that we will keep safeguarding the cinemas in difficult times, like we have been through the pandemic,” Park said in Korean. This marks Park’s third win at Cannes. He won the Grand Prix in 2003 for the thriller “Oldboy” and the Jury Prize in 2009 for the horror film “Thirst.” Although “The Handmaiden” failed to win at Cannes in 2016, it went on to win the best film not in the English language at the British Academy Film Awards in 2018. No stranger to Cannes -- this was his seventh visit -- Song won his first-ever Cannes prize for playing an illegal baby broker in Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda’s heartwarming tale about a Korean family seeking home for an abandoned baby found in a “baby box.” The film is Kore-eda’s first all-Korean cast, all Korean-language film and also stars Gang Dong-won, Lee Ji-eun, also known as singer IU, and Bae Doo-na who starred in Kore-eda’s 2009 film, “Air Doll.” Meeting with reporters later, Park explained how his film differs from others in similar genres and with similar plots. “The first part ends and the second part unfolds in a new direction,” Park said. The woman who was pictured as a mysterious femme-fatale is no longer a subject of male gaze, but telling her own story, moves to the center of the story, Park explained. Song paid tribute to Kore-eda for his understanding of Korean culture, which made Song and other Korean actors comfortable throughout the shoot. “I have seen almost all of Kore-eda’s films so far. Not just myself, but many Korean fans love his films for the distinctive aesthetics of Japanese movies,” Song told reporters. The nine-member jury led by French actor Vincent Lindon gave the Palme d’Or to Swedish director Ruben Ostlund’s class warfare comedy “Triangle of Sadness.” This is the director’s second win of the top honor prize after “The Square” in 2017. Actor Zar Amir Ebrahimi was named best actress for her role as a journalist in Ali Abbasi’s “Holy Spider.” The jury prize went to “Le Otto Montagne” directed by Charlotte Vandermeersch and Felix van Groeningen, and “Eo” by Jerzy Skolimowski.

""Korea's star actors and renowned crew members participated in this project,"" the Japanese director told Korean reporters on Wednesday (local time) on the sidelines of the ongoing 75th Cannes Film Festival in Cannes. ""If the film isn't fun, it's all my fault."" ""Broker,"" written and directed by Kore-eda, depicts the relationships of characters formed through a baby box, where people anonymously drop off newborns that they can't raise. It is the Japanese director's first Korean-language project and is produced and distributed by Korean firms, including CJ ENM, a leading entertainment firm in the country. ""Parasite"" star Song Kang-ho plays the lead role in the drama, along with star actors Kang Dong-won and Bae Doo-na and singer-and-actress Lee Ji-eun, also known as IU. Crew members behind ""Parasite,"" including director of photography Hong Kyung-pyo and composer Jung Jae-il, also teamed up with Kore-eda, who visited the Cannes festival for the eighth time with ""Broker"" following ""Shoplifters,"" the winner of the Palme d'Or in 2018. ""I can say that the movie has an excellent ensemble cast of five lead actors and two children actors. Their performance changes further in an interesting way,"" he said. ""I hope you enjoy their on-screen chemistry."" He noted that ""Broker"" is different from typical and familiar stories about family bound by blood or necessity featured in his critically acclaimed works, like ""Still Walking"" (2008), ""Like Father, Like Son"" (2013) and ""Shoplifters."" ""While doing some research and writing the script, I thought this movie is about life,"" he said. ""It tells a story of a life who gets involved with well- and ill-intentioned people and goes on a trip to Seoul from Busan."" Meanwhile, ""Broker"" drew mixed media reviews after the film's official screening as one of the in-competition pieces at Cannes on Thursday. British daily Guardian gave two stars out of five, saying that Kore-eda's new film is ""fundamentally silly, with tiringly shallow characterization."" It pointed out that the film depicts the broker (Song) or kidnapper, who steals a newborn for himself and offers it for sale on the adoption black market, as a ""lovable rogue."" The Telegraph also gave two stars in a review, saying ""this may be the Cannes competition's biggest disappointment."" On the other hand, US media Deadline said ""Broker"" has some ""slackness"" in the storytelling, but its warm and humorous tone works well throughout the story. ""Esteemed Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda walks a fine line between keen social observation and overt sentimental emotionalism in Cannes competition title 'Broker,'"" it said.

During a press conference at CGV Yongsan in Seoul on Tuesday, the Japanese director said he got a lot of help from “Parasite” star Song Kang-ho while filming his movie, “Broker.” “Before shooting the film, I had a meeting with director Bong Joon-ho. We talked over a meal and he gave me suggestions on shooting a film in a foreign country. He said I must be nervous directing a movie in a foreign country, but once everything begins, all I have to do is believe in Song Kang-ho,” the director said. “He told me that Song Kang-ho is like a sun that will shine light everywhere on the filming site. After I worked with him, I realized that he (Bong) was right. Because of Song, I was able to finish the project without any problem.” Koreeda’s highly anticipated film centers around the relationships formed through a “baby box,” a drop box installed at churches or institutions for desperate parents to leave babies anonymously. It aims to prevent those parents from abandoning or even killing their newborns. Song plays Sang-hyun, a mysterious “broker” who finds new parents for the abandoned babies and makes special deals with them. Korean heartthrob Gang Dong-won plays Sang-hyun’s business partner. Bae Doo-na plays a police officer who is on Sang-hyun’s trail. Singer and actor IU plays a mother who travels with Sang-hyun to find parents for her baby. During the press conference, Song recalled his first meeting with the director in Busan. “It was six or seven years ago, we met for the first time at the Busan International Film Festival. The title was not ‘Broker’ at the time,” Song said. “I decided to take the role because I am his fan and I love his works. He is an artist that I respect, so I was honored.” The director also briefly talked about the movie being selected to premiere at the upcoming Cannes Film Festival. “No matter how many times I’ve been there, Cannes always makes me nervous. I am also excited to be there. I think it is the best place for the world premiere of ‘Broker’,” the director said. The 75th Cannes Film Festival will run from May 17-28. Meanwhile, at the beginning of the press event, Song stood up and talked about the late Korean actor Kang Soo-youn, who died from cerebral hemorrhage on Saturday at the age of 55. “We actors are grieving over the tragic news from a few days ago,” Song said. “On behalf of the whole ‘Broker’ team, I offer condolences to Kang Soo-youn.” “Broker” will hit local theaters on June 8.",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU briefly as a cast member in ""Broker"" where she plays a mother who travels with Song Kang-ho's character to find parents for her baby.

Though a local adaptation of the webtoon series was made last year on Korean YouTube channel Jin Yong-jin, this is the first time a Korean webtoon’s IP is being adapted by foreign creators, production team and cast, according to Naver Webtoon. The five-part reality show on YouTube channel Jubilee features eight participants who are kept in separate cells in a facility for 10 days, seeking to win the maximum amount of prize money. The players will share a pool of $300,000 and aim to keep all the money during the 10-day survival. Helmed by director Mark Arbitrario, who was behind the TV series “Survivor” (2007) and “The Voice” (2014), “Money Game” makes for a compelling show as the participants have diverse racial and religious backgrounds and are from all walks of life. The first episode of the show was uploaded Monday and the subsequent episodes are set to be released on the same day every week. The original webtoon, written by author Bae Jin-soo in 2018, centers around a bankrupt man who participates in a survival game to win money. Eight competitors spend 100 days together in an isolated place and have to share a total of 44.8 billion won ($37 million), where consumer prices are 1,000 times more expensive than in the real world. “I had never imagined that my work would be adapted into an entertainment show overseas,” a Naver Webtoon press release quoted “Money Game” author Bae Jin-soo as saying. “I can feel that the status of Korean webtoon IP has risen, not only in Korea but also abroad.”  Webtoon “Money Game” and its sequel “Pie Game” are being reproduced into an eight-part drama series in Korea, starring singer and actor IU, actors Ryu Jun-yeol and Park Jeong-min.",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU only briefly at the end, noting her upcoming role in the Korean drama adaptation of ""Money Game"" and ""Pie Game.""

The smash-hit rom-com ""Crash Landing On You"" (2019) with Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin in starring roles will come back in the form of a musical in September at COEX in southern Seoul. The 16-episode ""Crash Landing On You,"" which aired simultaneously on the South Korean cable channel tvN and Netflix, is about star-crossed lovers from the two Koreas, depicting the political and geographical division on the Korean Peninsula. It became one of the most popular South Korean TV series in recent years, marking the highest viewership for a drama series of the cable channel. It also topped the most-viewed Netflix charts in many Asian regions, including Japan. Details of the musical production, including casting for the lead roles, have not yet been disclosed. A musical adaptation of the 1994 medical thriller ""M"" will start its Seoul run next month at an arts theater in Dongguk University. Starring Shim Eun-ha, the MBC TV series became the talk of the town for its suspenseful storyline involving abortion and its special visual effects featuring the green eyes of the main character. M, the soul of an aborted child, enters the body of the young girl and controls her to seek revenge on the people who would not allow him to be born. It became one of the highest-rated TV series in the country, posting a viewership of 52.2 percent.

The duet is opening a new chapter in their music career with new collaboration album “Next Episode,” releasing Monday evening. The seven-song package provides support and comfort to people when they hit rock bottom in their lives, brother and songwriter Lee Chan-hyuk and sister Lee Su-Hyun said during an online press conference. Fronted by lead track “Fall,” featuring singer and actress IU, the latest print for the group is a collaboration album brimming with the voices of A-listers, including veteran singer Lee Sun-hee, rapper Beenzino, Crush, Sam Kim, Zion.T and Choi Jung-hoon of indie rock band Jannabi, and is the first of its kind. It took years for the duo to team up with IU, making a dream come true for fans who had yearned for such a collaboration between the two. Su-hyun said she came together with the singer-songwriter because AKMU was looking for an artist who could “efficiently deliver the message of ‘Fall’ to the public” and that IU was a perfect match to the song. “She is popular and able to persuade anyone,” Su-hyun said, adding their work with IU became the start of the whole collaboration album. The sister-brother tandem said their main song was inspired by the movie “The Greatest Showman.” Chan-hyuk added that the word “fall” could be interpreted as a dark term, but he aims to send out positivity. “The song sends a positive message of inclusion, just like the film. We wanted to convey a hopeful message that ‘however deep down you fall, if you’re beside me holding my hand, nothing will matter,” Chan-hyuk said. Speaking about the music video to be released later, Chan-hyuk talked about how he falls endlessly. “If you get to see the clip, I continuously tumble down until the point where I hold Su-hyun’s hands. There’s a little tweak in this part. The screen is flipped upside down at this point to make it seem as if we’re soaring up in the sky, rather than falling.” He added that those who grasp the message of the song would be able to picture the duality of this particular scene. Chan-hyuk said the star-studded album centers around one common idea -- transcendent freedom, a term newly coined by the two. If their 2019 album’s “Freedom” explains freedom by “wanting to walk without clothes,” the pair tried to show a more buoyant mood in the latest album. The singer described the meaning behind transcendent freedom as an “extraordinary power that goes beyond people’s physical limits, allowing people to unplug from any external influence.” Chan-hyuk added that he aims to bring out a message not to be swayed even if one descends. When asked about what they wish to achieve through “Next Episode,” the chart-topping duo said they had set their hearts set on offering succor to those who are ready to make a leap of faith. “I started my music journey with the bold ambition to change the world with our music. But I realized that changing everyone is not the destination we are heading to,” Chan-hyuk said. He believes that the beauty of the world lies in diversity and wishes to encourage those set for a new change. From releasing an album with all jointly recorded songs to listing his name as a co-composer for Chan-hyuk, the duo also said they made several leaps of faith through the collaboration album. “It was the first time producing an album filled with other singers,” the two said together. The pair likened teaming up with seven artists to the Avengers, adding that they are beyond grateful to pair up their voices with the nation’s leading singers. A special space allowing music lovers to delve into transcendental freedom will also be available at Beaker’s flagship store in Yongsan, central Seoul, starting Tuesday until Aug. 8.

The singer bought a residential unit of Eterno Cheongdam, currently under construction by Hyundai Engineering & Construction, according to local news outlet Biz.Hankook. The 20-story villa with four floors underground has one or two residential units on each floor starting from the second floor above ground. A 488-square-meter super penthouse of the riverside luxury villa, one of the highest-end residential properties in Seoul, is currently on sale for 30 billion won. The residence purchased by the K-pop star measures around 244 square meters. She is likely to complete her payment all in cash, as loans for a residential property valued at 1.5 billion won are completely banned in the city. As she bought the new residence, she also sold another real estate property recently. In May 2012, she bought a housing unit measuring 173.82 square meters in Bangbae for 840 million won, and she had her residence registered at the property. She sold it in June 2019 for 860 million won. The 28-year-old owns other real estate properties around Seoul as well.

Backed by fans' organized support, K-pop groups often put their songs on the top spots on real-time music charts, but the songs sometimes descend lower within days.

The agreement will allow listeners overseas to resume enjoying songs by popular Korean artists, including IU and Zico, which were removed temporarily from the Spotify platform from the beginning of March. The platform operator at the time explained that the songs were not available because it failed to reach an agreement on renewing the licensing contract with Kakao Entertainment before it terminated. “We are pleased that Kakao Entertainment’s content and artists are back on Spotify, allowing our over 345 million global listeners across 170 countries to once again enjoy the music they love,” Spotify said in a statement. “We are delighted that our Korean listeners will now also be able to enjoy this local music alongside our over 70 million songs and more than 4 billion playlists.” “Through our diverse partnerships around the world including Spotify, we hope that music lovers around the world can easily access our artists and music,” Kakao Entertainment said in a statement. According to music industry sources, one of the key reasons why talks failed earlier was that the Korean company had been asking for separate licensing deals for the Korean market apart from the rest of the countries that Spotify operates in. The global streaming giant had reportedly refused to accept the offer. Securing popular Korean artists’ tracks, which are distributed by the Kakao affiliate, has been considered as one of the key factors required for Spotify’s expansion in the Korean market since it began its service in February. The Korean music distributor also runs Korea’s largest music streaming platform Melon, which enjoys a 37.5 percent local market share. Along with Korean platforms Genie and Flo, the trio together accounts for more than 80 percent of the market here. Now that the two companies have finally reached an agreement, Kakao Entertainment announced that it will gradually roll out its music content to Spotify for service in and outside of Korea from Friday. “Due to technical issues, we cannot start providing all the songs in different countries all at once,” a Kakao Entertainment spokesperson told The Korea Herald on Thursday.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2570220,K-pop fans hung out to dry over Kakao-Spotify music licensing termination,2021-03-05,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2021/03/05/20210305000541_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Last weekend, global K-pop fans on Spotify faced a blackout of hundreds of songs by popular artists, including Zico, Mamamoo and IU, after the Swedish audio giant's licensing agreement with South Korea's top music distributor Kakao M Corp. came to an end. While some music has since been restored under artists' separate labels, Spotify Technology SA and Kakao M, now known as Kakao Entertainment Corp., said discussions for a new deal are ongoing. The South Korean company's music has been available for Spotify's global listeners since 2016. But the two companies failed to come to terms for a renewal despite continued talks, according to an industry official. Online K-pop forums and social media have been abuzz about the move, with artists, such as Epik High's Tablo, voicing complaints over the removal. ""Why is it always the artists and the fans that suffer when businesses place greed over art?"" the hip hop artist tweeted earlier this week. The conflict is the latest development since Spotify's turbulent landing in South Korea -- the sixth largest music market in the world -- early last month. Spotify landed in the country without securing a licensing agreement for the local market with then Kakao M, which holds 37.5 percent of the songs on the top 400 Gaon Music Chart of the Korea Music Content Association. The South Korean company has pointed the finger at Spotify for the recent removal of songs, saying the streaming giant simultaneously pursued deals for both the global and South Korean markets. Spotify said in a statement that it has tried to renew the global deal for a year and a half. ""It is our hope that this disruption will be temporary and we can resolve the situation soon,"" the company said in a statement. ""We remain committed to working with local rights holders including Kakao M, to help grow the Korean music market and overall streaming ecosystem together."" Talks for the local deal are also currently under way, according to company officials. Experts say the tussle over the licensing deal emerged as K-pop expanded its presence in the global music market. Spotify has been operating K-pop playlists since 2014 and the company said that the share of K-pop listening on its platform jumped by more than 2,000 percent, with total streaming time reaching 180 billion minutes. ""As K-pop becomes more popular, there's more profit to go around, leading to conflicting interests,"" said Lee Gyu-tag, a professor of cultural studies at George Mason University Korea. Kakao Entertainment's parent Kakao Corp. competes with Spotify through Melon, the country's largest music streaming service. Melon holds a tight grip over the country's music streaming market with nearly nine million monthly active users. But its user base pales to Spotify's over 345 million global listeners. The music distributor has snubbed global music giant Apple Music in the past, with the US tech giant failing to secure many local titles when it launched in South Korea in 2016 and has since struggled to gain a significant market presence. Kakao Entertainment currently has a licensing deal with Apple Music for markets outside of South Korea, according to a company official. The conflict also comes as Kakao is aiming for its entertainment business to enter overseas markets. On Thursday, the local tech giant launched Kakao Entertainment Corp. by merging Kakao M and webcomic unit Kakao Page with goals to take on the global entertainment market based on its trove of artists and original content. As of now, Spotify faces growing pressure to clinch deals with Kakao M or risk losing its presence in South Korea and its global K-pop fans. ""The clash between the two companies was inevitable,"" Lee said. ""It's now important to watch what precedent they will set.""

The move has prevented global K-pop fans from listening to songs of major South Korean artists, including IU and Apink, through Spotify. The Swedish company said it has failed to reach an agreement on a new license deal with Kakao M, South Korea's top music distributor, despite efforts to clinch a contract over the past 1 1/2 years. Spotify launched its music streaming service in South Korea last month as it seeks to succeed in the local market with playlists specifically tailored for Korean listeners. It has faced heated competition against established homegrown services, including Kakao Corp.'s Melon, Genie Music under telecom operator KT Corp. and rival carrier SK Telecom's Flo. Spotify had provided Kakao M's music streaming service globally, but it has not offered such service on its Korean platform as both sides have yet to clinch a related deal. Spotify said the expiration of its global license deal with Kakao M has nothing to do with the latest launch of its Korean service. But Kakao M said the suspension came in accordance with Spotify's policy under which it seeks to clinch deals on domestic and global services simultaneously. The two companies said they will continue to hold negotiations. Spotify has more than 60 million songs on its playlist, with 345 million users across 170 markets.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2561258,A look back on IU’s 13-year music career,2021-02-19,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2021/02/19/20210219000192_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Artist to release fifth studio album soon “I want to say this to those people who were born rough yet special, including my friend. You’re not strange but stellar.” IU’s latest single, “Celebrity,” embodies that message -- for her friend, for herself and for everyone who finds it hard to love themselves, as the singer wrote in her introduction to the song. The song’s lyrics started off as a letter to a friend who is often considered odd by others. Writing down the words, IU realized they were not only for her friend but for herself and everyone else too, because we all have those moments in life when we feel out of place and isolated. Consolation is one of the core themes of the singer-songwriter’s work, as seen in “Through the Night” and “Dear Name.” But unlike those calm and soothing scores, “Celebrity” features a bright electro-pop sound. IU is attempting the genre for the first time in her 13-year career. With the prerelease single, IU has not only succeeded in landing atop the charts, she has also proved herself as a solid musician, one who is still evolving and expanding. IU stands at the pinnacle of South Korea’s entertainment scene, expanding her career both as a K-pop soloist and an actor. The 28-year-old tops the charts anytime she releases a new song, whether it’s a ballad or a dance, pop or folk song, and has led popular drama series from “My Mister” (2018) to “Hotel del Luna” (2019), building a reputation as a well-rounded entertainer like no other. On Sept. 18, 2008, IU -- real name Lee Ji-eun -- debuted as a solo singer with the EP “Lost and Found,” led by the track “A Lost Child.” Singing sad ballads at the age of 15, IU initially failed to grab listeners’ hearts. She says she thought at the time that the album might be her first and last. The next year, she released her first full-length album, “Growing Up,” led by dance track “Boo,” followed by another dance set. “IU…IM,” led by “Marshmallow,” was a breakthrough for IU. With “Nagging” (2010), featuring Lim Seul-ong of then-popular boy band 2AM, IU landed at No. 1 on the domestic music charts for the first time. Perhaps the start to IU’s triumphant career, “Good Day” topped the charts and music shows upon its release. IU finally made her name known, especially with the powerful triple high notes that became a sensation in and out of Korea. In the domestic music scene -- then dominated by K-pop idol groups and big-name ballad singers -- IU proved that a young female soloist could succeed with dance songs. In 2011, IU dropped her second album -- “Last Fantasy” led by “You & I.” This song was the first of IU’s age-oriented songs and was followed by “Twenty-Three,” “Palette” and “Eight.” While “You & I” was a huge commercial success, it was acclaimed for its authentic sound, incorporating big band music and instrumentals. IU also made inroads into Billboard with this track, topping the K-pop Hot 100 for the first time and peaking at No. 3 on the World Digital Song Sales chart. In 2013, with her third studio set, “Modern Times,” IU deviated from her usual sweet airy sound and girlish image. The lead track, “The Red Shoes,” incorporates various genres from jazz to swing and features an elaborate chorus. Not only did she prove herself capable of performing different styles of music, she landed at the top of the charts with all 13 tracks from the album. IU had a turning point as a singer-songwriter with the acoustic pop song “Friday,” included in the repackaged version of “Modern Times.” The seasonal love song “Not Spring, Love, or Cherry Blossom” further proved her capabilities as both a writer and a producer. With EP “Chat-shire” in 2015, IU took on the production of a whole album, marking the start of her career as a versatile artist capable of producing, writing and performing her own music. She also got bolder about expressing her personal thoughts through music. In “Twenty-Three,” she sings of the contradictory emotions she experienced at that age, caught between childhood and adulthood. The 2014 EP “A Flower Bookmark,” featuring remade oldies from the 1980s and 1990s, highlighted her talents of reinterpretation as she struck a careful balance between preserving the original song and delivering it through her authentic sound. In 2017, IU released “A Flower Bookmark 2” and said the series would continue. IU takes her introspection deeper with “Palette,” from her eponymous fourth regular album released in 2017. The lyrics show how much more mature and stable the 25-year-old IU has become. She presents the diverse colors of life, just like a palette, singing, “I got this. I’m truly fine.” This song also marks G-Dragon’s first time collaborating with a female solo artist outside YG. With time, IU became more daring, writing about her thoughts through unique sounds unheard elsewhere. “Bbibbi,” a laid-back alternative R&B single released in 2018 to mark her 10th anniversary, and “Blueming,” an upbeat song about the “blue” experience of falling in love, are good examples of this. The last of IU’s age-oriented songs, “Eight,” made in collaboration with BTS member Suga, nostalgically explores the diverse emotions faced by the two 28-year-old artists. With “Eight,” IU and Suga made it to the top of Billboard’s World Digital Song Sales chart. Besides G-Dragon and Suga, IU has collaborated with some of the world’s best musicians, transcending genres and generations. They include rapper Zico, Oh Hyuk of band Hyukoh, legendary hip-hop trio Epik High, first-generation K-pop idol group g.o.d and veteran actor-musician Kim Chang-wan. Now an established actor, IU boasts a TV presence as well. Not only does she lead a number of popular dramas, she has actively taken part in the production of music for TV. She has also had huge hits with variety shows featuring her such as “Hyori’s Homestay” (2017) and “House on Wheels” (2020). With “Celebrity,” released Jan. 27, IU gave fans a peek at her fifth studio album, slated to be dropped in the weeks to come. While no other information about the album has been released, and the exact release date is still unknown, the prerelease single piqued anticipation about what wonders and soothing messages IU will unravel through the set.

Korean users have access to over 60 million tracks and 4 billion playlists, the global audio streaming subscription service said. Spotify also emphasized that it aims to capture the local market with playlists specifically tailored for South Korean users, as well as its high-quality recommendation engine. Currently, the global streaming platform provides two different kinds of subscription options in Korea -- Premium Individual that costs 10,900 won ($9.80) a month and Premium Duo that costs 16,350 won a month, exclusive of taxes. With the premium service, subscribers can access music streaming with high sound quality, play downloaded music without an internet connection and enjoy music with no ad interruptions. Premium Duo is a two-person plan that offers two separate Spotify Premium accounts on one bill. Listeners in Korea can try out Spotify’s premium service free for seven days on their mobile phones without providing any credit card information. Those who provide their credit card information can enjoy premium services for three months free of charge. These free trials will be available through the end of June. Meanwhile, local music industry insiders have downplayed Spotify’s possible impact on the highly competitive Korean market. It has yet to sign deals to provide Korean music tracks from local music distribution giants like Kakao M, which owns tracks of popular singers such as IU, Zico and Monsta X. Many industry insiders are also curious as to why Spotify decided to launch without Kakao M. Spotify had announced on Dec. 18 that it would launch its service in Korea sometime in the first half of 2021. “We are still talking with Spotify (about distributing our songs through their platform),” a Kakao M spokesperson told The Korea Herald on Tuesday. Kakao M runs Korea’s largest music streaming platform Melon, which enjoys a 37.5 percent local market share. Korean platforms Genie and Flo follow in market share and the three platforms together account for more than 80 percent of the market here. The lack of Korean artists’ tracks has been considered one of the main obstacles that global audio streaming companies, such as Apple Music, face in seeking to expand in the Korean market, according to music industry sources. Apple Music, which entered the Korean market in 2016, struck deals with three entertainment companies -- SM Entertainment, JYP Entertainment and YG Entertainment -- for their artists’ music tracks. However, it also failed to sign on Kakao M. Meanwhile, Spotify on Tuesday named David Park as its managing director for Korea. “Our team on the ground has been working closely with local artists, labels and cultural tastemakers to offer an unrivaled music listening and discovery experience, ensuring that Spotify is going to be loved by listeners and artists in Korea,” Park said in a statement. Before joining Spotify, Park worked as the general manager at UberEats Korea, leading its diversification and expansion here.

The musical will focus on the death of the fictional detective in the short story “The Adventure of the Final Problem,” published in 1893. Stage actors Kim Jong-gu, Hong Seung-an and Kim Chan-jong have been cast as Doyle. Jeong Min, Cho Pung-rae and Paek Ki-beom are to play Holmes.

Stage actors Jung Wook-jin and Choi Min-woo are to play Hae-woong, while Song Na-young and Hong Na-hyun are to play Ok-hee, with director Kim Dong-hyun at the helm. The musical was selected through the Chungmu Art Center’s debut program for writers in 2018, and Pyo Sang-ah wrote the script. Though it is set in dark times, the musical bills itself as a humorous production with elements of comedy. Occult film “The Priests” has been made into a musical, which is set to run Feb. 25 to May 30 at Uniplex in central Seoul. The 2015 film, starring big-name actors Gang Dong-won, Kim Yoon-seok and “Parasite” star Park So-dam, was seen by 5.45 million theatergoers. The supernatural mystery thriller featured two Roman Catholic priests, played by Kang and Kim, who try to help a young girl possessed by an evil spirit, played by Park.

Singer IU topped the list of most-streamed Korean female artists, while Agust D, better known as Suga of BTS, was ranked the most-streamed male artist last year.

According to Spotify, South Korea -- the sixth-largest music market globally -- is an important market for accomplishing its mission to connect creative artists with music fans worldwid. The global audio streaming subscription service will give Korean listeners access to over 60 million tracks and over 4 billion playlists, the company said. The streaming platform operator, known for its AI-based music curation service, highlighted that it will enable diverse Korean artists to reach local music fans, as well as Spotify’s 320 million global listeners. Although this is the first time that Spotify is entering Korea‘s streaming market, it is not its first time working with local musicians. The Swedish audio streaming provider debuted its first K-pop playlist in 2014. Since then, its users have have streamed more than 180 billion minutes of the genre and added K-pop tracks to more than 120 million Spotify playlists. The share of K-pop listening has increased by more than 2,000 percent in the last six years, according to Spotify. According to the local music industry insiders, the global streaming giant’s performance in the Korean market will depend on whether it can successfully provide Korean artists’ tracks through the platform by joining hands with large K-pop powerhouses here. In 2016, another global audio streaming service provider, Apple Music, entered the Korean market, signing contacts with three entertainment companies — S.M. Entertainment, JYP Entertainment and YG Entertainment. However, it failed to provide tracks of Kakao M’s artists, which include popular singers like IU. This has been considered one of the limitations to Apple Music’s expansion in the local market, according to music industry sources. Currently, Kakao runs Korea’s largest music streaming platform Melon, which has a more than 35 percent share of the local market, followed by Korean platforms Genie and Flo. The three platforms together account for more than 80 percent of the market here. Regarding questions on whether it had signed contracts with all the main local entertainment companies and how many Korean tracks it will provide to Korean users, Spotify declined to answer. “We cannot comment on specific licensing agreements,” a Spotify spokesperson told The Korea Herald on Friday. “We are committed to ensuring close alignment and partnership with key stakeholders through mutual, collaborative and transparent discussions.” By Song Seung-hyun ()",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU specifically, but only in passing as an example of a popular artist under Kakao M's roster who was not available on Apple Music in Korea.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2434207,"[Digital Simplicity] IU, 8K display and next-generation gaming",2020-09-26,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2020/09/11/20200911000368_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Last Saturday, singer IU’s newest live performance video was revealed on YouTube. It was a landmark event since the video was formatted in 8K resolution, which easily outperforms 4K display. A small number of those who purchased the prohibitively expensive and visually expansive 88-inch OLED TV from LG Electronics were lucky enough to get a glimpse of what the 8K technology could offer, thanks to the stunning image featuring IU’s equally exquisite live performance. Just in case you have no idea who IU is, let me introduce her a bit. IU (whose name is Lee Ji-eun) is a top singer-songwriter and actress and has a huge fan base here -- so much so that a lot of Korean music fans helplessly stick to home-grown streaming music services largely because Apple Music, apparently due to copyright and contract issues, does not provide her music in the Korean market. The 8K video uploaded on YouTube, in which IU belted out her hit song “You & I” on “You Heeyeol’s Sketchbook” music program, garnered more than 500,000 views, and is now deemed as a reference to check whether your 8K display works properly. I watched the video with a new 4K computer monitor I bought recently. It was immensely impressive, even on 4K display. When I raised the resolution setting from 4K to 8K (fully aware that my screen is not designed to support 8K) on YouTube, the screen froze. It seems that my computer system, even with high-end options, found it hard to handle the enormous amount of digital data needed to stream 8K video. What should be noted is that KBS, a state-run TV station which aired the special program, recorded IU’s performance in 8K resolution but opted for YouTube to distribute the showcase piece. Under the current TV infrastructure, local TV stations are ill-equipped to broadcast 8K video seamlessly. I reckon that this is why KBS decided to let those who have 8K TVs and top-end desktop computers check out the eye-popping quality of the video through YouTube. For 8K TV makers such as LG Electronics and Samsung Electronics, IU’s live performance video is a blessing. Thanks to the high-profile video whose view count is likely to go up on the strength of IU’s popularity, TV makers can expect that the next-generation TV would be more readily accepted in the market, accelerating the shift from 4K to 8K. A similar technological shift is underway in the gaming industry. Both Microsoft and Sony are now getting ready to launch their next-generation video consoles later this year, promising better graphics and performance. The new machines support 4K video at 128 frames per second, a clear upgrade from today’s mainstream gaming systems. Microsoft, in particular, pins high hopes on Xbox Game Pass, a video game subscription service, which is “Netflix for video games.” Many Korean gamers at major online communities are talking about whether such subscription services could succeed, especially after Microsoft surprised the market this week by acquiring renowned US-based game developer Bethesda for $7.5 billion. Some users are considering PC-based gameplay after buying a Xbox Game Pass, while bypassing the purchase of the new console. The reason is the much-awaited debut of next-generation graphics cards, namely Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3080 and 3090 series. On Wednesday, two US tech YouTubers -- Marques Brownlee and Linus Sebastian -- rolled out videos introducing the sizzling appeal of 8K gaming powered by RTX 3090 graphics cards. Both videos were based on LG’s 88-inch OLED TV, whose retail price in Korea is set at more than 44 million won (about $37,000). To enjoy watching IU’s live performance in 8K format on a big screen, you would have to spend a lot of money upgrading your desktop computer system. The full-fledged 8K video, whether it’s a live performance on YouTube or gaming, requires the latest CPU, graphics card, TV set and other related components for a powerful desktop PC. Is it worth it? If you watch IU’s performance in 4K or lower resolution and find it good enough, a pricey upgrade to the 8K computer system could be premature. After all, 8K technology will eventually replace 4K in the coming years. Until then, many IU fans will likely feel that their smartphone screen is big enough as long as they can watch her impeccable performance.

The much-anticipated song has been co-written and composed by the singer-songwriter and the BTS member, who’s not only served as a producer but also lent his vocal for the track. Its title refers to the age of the two musicians, as both are 28 (Korean age). “As musicians of the same age, the two singers could relate to one another and create their own unique synergy in the song,” said IU’s agency EDAM Entertainment in a released statement. “Eight” follows IU’s 2019 EP “Love Poem.”  The uplifting song, which flourishes on nostalgic pop-rock band sound, blends IU’s soaring vocal with Suga’s soothing rapping. IU explained that the self-reflective song continues the legacy of her age-themed songs such as “Twenty-three” and “Palette.” ""If the previous songs used to take a form of an ‘essay’ through which I directly talked to listeners, ‘Eight’ is like a short novel that confesses my life as a 28-years-old by using a virtual figure and various metaphors,” wrote the singer in an introduction for “Eight.” “While I’m not sure whether it’s from my personal emotion or from the overall social atmosphere coming from the disaster, my 28 would be remembered by the recurring feeling of lethargy and longing for the ‘orange island’ where we felt freedom rather than sadness.” Part of the song’s lyric reads, “Under the orange sun we dance together without shadows / There’s no such thing as a decided goodbye / Let’s meet on that beautiful memory.” In a lead up to the song’s release, Suga also shared on his broadcast channel that the production process with IU has been very smooth, saying, “There wasn’t a lot of back-and-forth. Shortly after I sent the (song’s) beats to her, she sent it back with the melody.” He also added that he’s been listening to the song quite often after finishing working on it, while he rarely listens to the songs he’s worked on after they are completed. The musicians have pretty much kept the song in mystery, raising K-pop listeners’ expectations over the last few days. They’ve only released few teaser contents, including a cryptic teaser video featuring IU in a futuristic setting. The song’s accompanying music video switches between an animation and scenes featuring IU, where she walks into a futuristic room and puts herself into a trance to travel various phases of her life. One of the most popular singer-actors, IU has scored multiple chart-toppers throughout her over a decade-long career, carving out her own niche in the small-screen as well. Most recently, she dropped “Give You My Heart” for the soundtrack of Korean hit drama “Crash Landing On You.” This is not the first time that Suga, whose stage name is Agust D, has proved his producing prowess. He’s previously produced songs like “Song Request” by Lee So-ra, “Wine” by Suran, “We Don’t Talk Together” by Heize, as well as several numbers for BTS such as “Boyz with Fun” and “Ddaeng.” The BTS rapper is reportedly working on the group’s upcoming album.

""Eight,"" set for release next Wednesday, was jointly created by the K-pop queen and actress and the rapper from BTS, and comes with a rap part by the latter. The collaboration brings together the musical power of IU, arguably the country's most sought-after artist for music collaboration of today, with the glamour and talent of Suga from one of the most popular music bands in the world. Two teaser images of the digital single, released by IU's management agency Edam Entertainment, zoom in on IU's hands in two different conditions -- set aside and uncared for as opposed to jeweled and brought to attention -- against the ivory and orange-colored backdrops, subtly alluding to the upcoming song's dreamy vibes. The song reportedly deviates from the music styles the artists have explored so far, adding a new line of musical work to their repertoires. The joint project is the latest in a series of similar star-studded collaboration works the K-pop scene has spawned recently, a phenomenon that comes as the K-pop industry is struggling to shake off the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, another high-profile collaboration song, ""Refresh,"" brought together Zico and Kang Daniel, two of the hottest male solos in today's K-pop music scene. Zico, a rapper and producer who dominated local music charts for weeks with ""Any Song"" earlier this year, also teamed up with American DJ Steve Aoki to produce the song under a joint campaign between American beverage maker PepsiCo, Inc. and Korean music label Starship Entertainment. The Zico-Kang duo cut a glamorous sight in the song's music video promoting Korean aesthetics, appearing in traditional Korean overcoats against the backdrop of Korean heritage assets, such as the Korean writing system Hangeul, the traditional Korean house ""hanok"" and Korean performing arts. Also last week, the K-pop scene welcomed in an unprecedented collaboration coupling rapper and producer Tiger JK with Pengsoo, a wildly popular penguin character created by the national education broadcasting channel EBS. The simple, humorous yodel-inspired hip-hop song, ""This is Pengsoo,"" topped several real-time music charts last week, including Genie Music, becoming an immediate hit.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2160587,Playlist: 10 relaxing IU songs to keep you warm this winter,2019-12-05,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2019/12/05/20191205000632_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"The nippy winter is in full swing -- time to take out the cozy essentials like a fuzzy blanket, padded coat and, most importantly, a renewed winter playlist. And just in time, K-pop fans have recently been treated to a new album from IU, whose sweet, comforting vocals make her one of the most sought-after acts this time of the season. While the chart-topping singer-songwriter is beloved regardless of the weather, many of her emotional ballads have especially served as a remedy for winter blues, all the more for their poetic lyrics and her sophisticated delivery. Celebrating her return with the sweeping “Love Poem” album, here are 10 relaxing songs by IU that will keep you company on a winter night. 1. “Love Poem” (2019) Preceded by the release of IU’s latest “Love Poem” EP, the song is a warm ode to those struggling with life out there. Kicking off with somber piano chords, this sentimental ballad slowly swells into emotional richness that evokes a whirlwind of feelings. Its soul-stirring melody strikes a balance between sadness and darkness, but IU makes sure to heal wounded hearts by belting out, “Take a deep breath. I’ll sing for you who has forgotten how to cry out loud” in the refrain. The “Love Poem” EP had been delayed from its original release following the death of singer and actress Sulli, a close friend of IU. 2. “Dear Name” (2017) One of the double titles from IU’s popular “Palette” album, the evocative ballad begins with a gentle piano-and-string croon that climaxes into a breathtaking belt session where IU’s vocal prowess truly shines. Co-written by the singer herself and composer Kim Ee-na, the song “is a story of all of us, a song of consolation and reconciliation for everyone,” to quote IU, with its heartwarming lyrics addressing that all the “names” worldwide deserve to be known. IU performed the song at the 2017 Melon Music Awards with lesser-known aspiring musicians to better deliver the song’s message. 3. “Ending Scene” (2017) Also released on the singer’s “Palette” album, this fan-favorite stirring ballad, composed by singer-songwriter Sam Kim, details a post-breakup feeling. Smoothly escalating from IU’s sophisticated, narration-like vocals, the song soars into an impassioned refrain where IU hopes a lover finds someone that loves him as much as he loves himself. The song was covered by a number of fellow musicians, including BTS’ Jungkook and Paul Kim. 4. “Through the Night” (2017) This soft folk-ballad is one of IU’s most critical hits, speaking to her impressive songwriting skill. The self-written song portrays a woman who pens a heartfelt letter for her lover one peaceful summer night. Minimalized on instruments -- majorly led by acoustic guitar -- the song shimmers on her velvety vocals and poetic lyrics, receiving kudos from many music critics. The award-winning song has also appealed widely to the public for its comforting feelings, a key to its long-lasting success on the charts. IU once named “Through the Night” as one of her most representative songs, saying, “I wish people could remember this song after I die.” 5. “Knees” (2015) Providing listeners a home-like sense of comfort, “Knees” is soothing and calming to the heart. Composed and penned by IU, the singer reportedly wrote the song when she struggled with insomnia, missing her grandmother who used to put her to bed when she was young. Led by a simple piano chord, the song is beloved by many fans for its lullaby-like melody and nostalgic lyrics, praised as “one of the best songs to listen to on sleepless nights.” 6. “Only I Didn’t Know” (2011) From its heart-wrenching lyrics to saccharine melody, this tear-jerking ballad is the ultimate breakup anthem. Composed by renowned composer Yoon Sang and written by lyricist Kim Ee-na, the song has completely altered IU’s girl-next-door image from her breakout hit “Good Day” into a maturing artist on her own. The singer’s meticulous delivery of the song was also highly praised given that she was only 18 years old when she promoted it. 7. “Seeking for a Star” (2011) Composed by veteran singer-songwriter Kim Kwang-jin, this orchestral ballad released on IU’s “Last Fantasy” album sounds like a beautiful poem. Lyrically, it’s about missing someone she once loved before but can’t see anymore, equating that person to “a star in my heart.” Its highlight comes when the singer’s soaring vocals are paired with the mellifluous chorus done by Kim, who participated in the song to add a whole other layer. 8. “The First Breakup, That Night” (2010) This one’s not a typical breakup ballad. Composed and penned by singer-songwriter Yoon Jong-shin, its lyrics that crudely depict post-breakup feelings are easily relatable, while its melody that vacillates between melancholy and saccharine creates mixed feelings. The song, which was released on IU’s iconic “Real” EP, has been overshadowed by the album’s infamous “Good Day,” but it is another hidden gem that deserves better recognition. 9. “Riding on a Train” (2009) Part of her early discography, “Riding on a Train” may sound like a classical production due to its easy-on-the-ear melody, but fans still choose it as one of IU’s best works that they put on repeat. Lyrically, IU sings about how she hopes to leave behind lingering breakup pains and memories by hopping on a train. It’s been nearly a decade since its release, but this polished ballad never gets old. 10. “Lost Child” (2008) It may come as a surprise that IU was only 15 years old when she debuted with “Lost Child,” an intensive ballad track that embraces a darker side of the singer. The song failed to make a splash at the time, which proved difficult for IU in her early days, but the mature vocal styling and emotional expression made it an underappreciated work that has only recently resurfaced as an early masterpiece by the singer.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2059566,[Herald Review] ‘Hotel Del Luna’ wins over viewers with spooky romance,2019-07-29,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2019/07/29/20190729000423_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"TvN’s Saturday-Sunday drama “Hotel Del Luna” recorded its highest viewership rating over the weekend with Sunday’s episode peaking at 9.7 percent with an average viewership rating of 8.7 percent. The numbers are higher than the ratings peak for “Arthdal Chronicles,” that was shown in the same slot, which was at 7.7 percent. Initial expectations had not been too high, as the drama was scheduled to air between the second and the third part of “Arthdal Chronicles,” a blockbuster production with a reported budget of 54 billion won ($45.7 million). Star scriptwriter pair Hong Jung-eun and Hong Mi-ran, widely known as Hong sisters, had a tough time with recent productions “Warm and Cozy” (2015) and “Hwayugi” (2017). “Hotel Del Luna” is the sisters’ 12th co-production. The casting also left many in doubt. Though IU, 26, has been on a winning streak with her choice of dramas, including “My Mister” (2018), Yeo Jin-goo, 22, has had his ups and downs. The storyline evolves around Jang Man-wol (IU), the owner of Hotel Del Luna, a hotel for spirits who have just died. Cursed with living forever, she hires the unwilling Goo Chan-sung (Yeo Jin-goo) to manage the hotel, gifting him with the ability to communicate with sprits. At the hotel, Goo sees to it that guests feel comforted, satisfying their unfulfilled desires in life. Some evil spirits are ready to take control of the weak-hearted Goo, but Jang always shows up to save him. It was the first time that IU has partnered with a younger, less-experienced male actor. The relationship between the two is the reverse of what viewers saw in “Guardian: The Lonely and Great God” (2016-2017). In that drama, the female lead (Kim Go-eun) was the delicate human-being who sees ghosts and the almighty male lead (Gong Yoo) protects her no matter what. Jang and Goo’s relationship works the other way around. As Jang, IU exhibits a sense of eternal loneliness hidden beneath a cranky and grumpy temper. Her stylish outfits are also a draw. Her mostly retro-style looks, include dramatic wide brim hats and long draped silk skirts. The Hong sisters have been famous for their charming female characters, creating memorable lead roles for Han Ye-seul in “Couple or Trouble” (2006), Shin Min-a in “My Girlfriend is a Gumiho” (2010) and Gong Hyo-jin in “Master’s Sun” (2013). It seems like IU is about to take up the baton. Yeo, on the other hand, is an actor who has been working hard to shake off the image he developed as a child actor. His acting had been somewhat stiff at the beginning, trying too hard, perhaps. But as the story develops, he has been blending in with the whole picture. On Sunday, Jang realizes she has fallen in love with Goo and wonders whether Goo is a reincarnation of her past lover. The 16-episode airs at 9 p.m. on cable channel tvN.

Most concerts featuring world-famous singers can’t accommodate all the fans who want to be there, and ticket-reservation websites often crash as soon as tickets to a popular concert become available. The impact of too many people logging in at the same time is just too much for the servers. Knowing that competition will be fierce, fans gear up in advance as the day approaches, sometimes even resorting to improper means. They may use several friends’ IDs in hopes of purchasing one ticket, or they may use sketchy online ticket-trading sites. The more famous a singer is, the more of a nightmare it can be to get a ticket for a concert that should be a treasured memory. More and more, online scalpers are snatching up all the best seats by using macro programs -- computer programs that click continuously, buying more tickets faster than any human can. The scalpers then resell them to fans at extortionate prices. Until recently, there was no effective way to stop online scalping because there was no clear law against the practice. But as the problem got more and more widespread, singers and fans who fell victim to this dishonest form of ticket trading decided to take action. Veteran solo singer IU and her agency, Kakao M, drew praise for the definitive policy announced Sept. 27 on the agency’s official homepage. According to the announcement, if any ticket-trading irregularity is detected, the agency will buy the ticket to see the registration information, cancel the ticket and take legal action. If the ticket broker is found to be a member of IU’s official fan club, the person will be permanently eliminated from the club and can never attend another IU event. Not only singers but fans too are doing their best to hunt down online scalpers. Some fans are volunteering as “illegal ticket hunters,” searching for online posts advertising concert tickets at inflated prices and reporting them to the agency. Some agencies are compensating people who make such reports to encourage more fans to participate in stopping the ticket scalpers. As ticket release dates approach, tips can be found online showing how to report unauthorized ticket trading. Currently, unauthorized ticket trading constitutes a misdemeanor under the Minor Offenses Act, but only if it takes place on the scene -- that is, offline. Online ticket brokers cannot be prosecuted under the law as it is currently written.

He is among a growing line of Korean celebrities who -- upon being labeled “feminist,” or “anti-feminist” -- get thrown into the line of fire by the public. In a recent interview with BBC News Korea, the actor expressed concerns over feminism-related discussions in Korea degenerating into a battle of the sexes.  “This movement (in Korea) has taken the form of us versus them, spreading out in the form of a violent movement. ... There is the structure of ‘men, the discriminator of women’ versus ‘women, the victim.’ We must co-exist in this world, and I believe that the way to do so must be discussed in a less aggressive, more peaceful way,” said Yoo. The actor has defined himself as a feminist and called it “the most important human rights movement of today.” But he has been labeled as a misogynist by some feminists after he refused to apologize for joking about an online commenter being hit by a zucchini. (To read more about the incident, click: Yoo Ah-in moves to end ‘gender bashing’ dispute with netizens) Feminism most-widely refers to a range of movements that strive to achieve equal rights between the sexes. But the terminology has taken on a different connotation in Korea, due to what can be seen as gender-bashing by some portion of the movement. The phenomenon can be traced back to the misogynistic culture at some male-dominated online communities such as Ilbe. This, in turn, led to the creation of men-hating websites that “mirrored” the actions of their misogynistic counterparts. Being linked to “feminism” in any way has had severe repercussions for celebrities here. “My Mister,” a tvN drama, was recently accused of misogyny for a scene in which the female protagonist Lee Ji-an is beaten up by a loan shark. Her sarcastic comment “You like me, huh?” invited accusations that the scene attempted to romanticize dating violence, although there was no indication that the two characters were ever romantically involved and the character of the loan shark and the said scene were depicted in a negative way. IU -- who played Lee Ji-an -- was attacked on “radical feminist” websites for “selling the fantasy of dating older men,” referring to her on-screen relationship with her older boss. The singer-actor on Monday announced that she would take legal action over malicious online comments. Comedian Yoo Byung-jae was embroiled in controversy after pointing out that the drama never intended to justify violence. His comment, “Whenever I want to learn about feminism, they (women) push me away because I’m a Han-nam-chung (Korean male bug), and the other side pushes me away because I’m a hardcore-feminist,” made during a stand-up comedy show, also drew criticism. Being labeled “feminist” has an equally negative impact on a celebrity’s reputation.  K-pop star Seolhyeon of AOA recently was thrust into the maelstrom for un-following Yoo Ah-in, Yoo Byung-jae and IU on Twitter while following Luna of f(x), who advocates feminism. Despite the K-pop star remaining mum on the meaning of her Twitter activity, it was interpreted as supporting feminism and invited criticism from male-dominated online communities. A local media outlet on Monday even published the article “Seolhyeon, a traitor to male fans?” In March, Irene of Red Velvet came under fire for saying that she read the feminist novel “Kim Ji Young, Born 1982,” as fans posted online burned and torn up photos of the K-pop star.

At a media briefing held Wednesday, the producer and cast attempted to dispel concerns about the program, appealing to the public to see its sincerity. The tvN drama that airs at 9:30 p.m. on Wednesdays and Thursdays aims to portray how scarred souls heal each other, focusing on a relationship between a man in his mid-40s and a woman in her early 20s. The drama was criticized for setting up a couple with a 20-year age gap. With singer-actress Lee Ji-eun, better known by her stage name IU, taking the role of the 21-year-old woman, the controversy only deepened. Lee had already been mired in controversy for using the Lolita complex as a concept, particularly in her self-produced album “Chat-shire” in 2015. Despite her attempts, Lee has never been fully able to shake off criticism of impropriety. Lee admitted that she was concerned when offered the role, as it seemed likely to revive the old controversy. She said she hesitated in accepting it. “After reading the synopsis, I wanted to take the role. But I couldn’t readily say ‘yes,’ as I was worried that the drama might be swept up in unnecessary controversy because of me,” she said. “I even asked the producer if he knows about the controversy surrounding me, if he would be OK with it.” Producer Kim Won-suk managed to persuade her, stressing, “It’s not a love story, but a human story.” Speaking about his female lead, tears fell down the producer’s cheeks -- perhaps grateful to the actress, perhaps feeling sorry for her, too. “I have to thank her very much for playing the role well. The Lee Ji-ahn (Lee’s role in the drama) that actress Lee Ji-eun plays, is better than the one I prepare. She greatly contributes to the drama,” he said. To fend off possible criticism, the production team has paid extra attention to self-censoring some of the more provocative scenes. Though he is not fully content with the moves, the producer said it was necessary to achieving the drama’s original goal -- redefining the word “mister,” or “ajeossi” in Korean. “In recent years, the word seems to have come to have a negative meaning, making me wonder why. Through the drama, I hope to redefine the word and change its image,” Kim said. Kim also said the character played by Lee Sun-kyun, Lee Ji-eun’s “ajeossi,” is a reflection of himself. “The relationship between the two (main characters) is very odd,” he said, adding that such a relationship would typically be seen as inappropriate. “But we wanted to make viewers understand that the two become important for each other.” The producer who has directed hit series such as “Misaeng” and “Signal” said he is satisfied with the current series, having received more calls than ever from industry insiders complimenting him. He thinks “My Mister” has a unique, “previously unseen” female lead character. “Lee Ji-ahn is very dark. In many Korean dramas, female characters are often projections of the viewers. But Lee is too dark for that, hard to understand, too,” Kim said. Though the drama has a dark atmosphere, the producer considers it a comedy. “Comedy is what I would like to produce, but also it is the hardest to make. But essentially, ‘My Mister’ is a comedy, as it finds happiness in a tough life,” he said. Eight more episodes remain of the 16-episode series. It has so far garnered an average viewership rating of 4.5 percent.

It can’t be certain yet, but it seems drama series “My Mister” has drawn enough attention to kick off a good start. The first episode of tvN’s new series “My Mister” premiered Wednesday night to a high viewership rating of 3.9 percent, but viewers showed mixed reactions on the drama. The rating was the second highest of tvN’s Wednesday-Thursday lineup, following “Prison Playbook.” The series received massive attention from the public before its release, as the possible romance between the main characters with a large age gap stirred controversy. Fans of IU also welcomed the K-pop diva’s return to the small screen, as she hasn’t been seen in a TV drama since “Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo” in 2016. The term “My Mister” swept Naver’s real-time trending bar Thursday morning, while over 147,000 tweets with the title spread across the social media platform as well.   Many viewers gave favorable reviews of the first episode, but many also expressed rage or discomfort toward both the concept and the series’ violent scenes. “There were no signs of romance in the first episode. Why do people react so sensitively over the issue (about romance between a middle-aged man and a young woman) that’s not even included in the drama?” one user posed in a review on Naver. “I really liked the actors and actresses, soundtrack and direction of the drama. Can’t wait until the next episode!” a dissenting voice on Naver said in a comment that garnered nearly 700 likes in four hours. “I thought I was watching a movie, not a TV drama. It’s amazing!” another comment says. “Was it necessary to include the scene that a male actor brutally hits a skinny and weak actress like that? Also, the actress says ‘You love me, right?’ after the beating. How horrible is it to glamorize violence with love?” a Twitter user said. The tweet was quickly shared 1,400 times with 1,253 comments, mostly agreeing with the opinion. “IU has bruises and scars on her face in the teaser video of the drama, as the concept of the drama is that a man clears her debt and beats her instead,” another Twitter user said. The tweet was retweeted over 25,900 times. “I looked up the scenario of the drama, as many people showed discomfort about it. But wait, what’s the drama trying to say? Why should we see middle-aged men with love? I don’t get it,” read a tweet that was retweeted nearly 8,000 times.

BTS was chosen winner of the award by the KMA's selection committee, composed of 56 judges who are music journalists, radio and television music program producers, columnists and critics. BTS was nominated earlier this month along with singer-songwriter IU, indie rock band Hyukoh and folk musician Kim Mok-in for the highly-coveted award category. The seven-piece boy band last year released its fifth EP album, ""Love Yourself: Her,"" which sold over 1.58 million copies to become the highest-selling album in South Korea in 16 years, after idol group g.o.d's fourth studio album in 2001. BTS has also enjoyed massive success overseas, with two tracks in the album -- DNA and Mic Drop -- both charting on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and being certified ""gold"" by the Recording Industry Association of America. Song of the Year was awarded to ""Tomboy"" by Hyukoh, after a five-way competition between Red Velvet's ""Red Flavor,"" ""DNA"" by BTS, ""Through the Night"" by IU and ""We Are"" by hip hop artist Woo Won-jae. Album of the Year award was handed to indie folk artist Kang Tae gu for his second studio album, ""bleu."" Rookie of the Year went to rock trio Sesoneon, while mainstream girl group Red Velvet took home Best Pop Music award for their 2017 summer hit ""Red Flavor."" IU was awarded Best Pop Album for her fourth full-length album ""Palette."" Hard rock-electronic music trio Idiotape took away the Best Electronic & Dance Album award with its third studio album ""Dystopian,"" as Cifika was awarded best song of the year for the category with ""My Ego."" Rico won Best R&B & Soul award with ""Paradise,"" as Hyukoh swept both Best Modern Rock Song and Best Modern Rock Album awards. Underground metal band Abyss took away Best Metal and Hardcore Album award with ""Recrowned."" Best Rap & Hip Hop Album award went to Viann and Khundi Panda for their joint album ""Reconstruction,"" while the best song for the category went to ""We Are"" by Woo Won-jae. KMA was formed in 2004 by a group of music critics, reporters, radio producers and cultural scholars as an alternative to big awards run by the country's three major TV networks -- KBS, MBC and SBS -- whose fairness had been called into question over many years. Most of today's music awards, such as those by streaming companies Melon, Soribada and music sales tracker Gaon, rely mostly on data, accounting for physical and digital sales, streaming and online popularity votes. KMA distinguishes itself by openly ditching the sales-based evaluation methodology and relying purely on recommendations from its selection committee. While KMA is often referred to as the ""Korean Grammys,"" it is more in the vein of Britain's Critics' Choice awards, given that members of the press and the critics community are part of the voting committee. Votes for the Grammy Awards are exclusive to members of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.

With her latest offering “A Flower Bookmark #2,” IU aims to present herself as a thoughtful musician whose heart belongs to the bygone decades. Maybe it’s her signature breathy and light vocals, but the cover album doesn’t quite bear the weight and complicated emotions of the originals. IU flaunts her crystal clear voice in “Autumn Morning,” a 1991 folk tune by veteran singer Yang Hee-eun and guitarist Lee Byung-woo. But the song’s poetic lyrics are overshadowed by the singer’s overly sweet and soft voice. “Secret Garden,” a cover of Lee Sang-eun’s beloved song from 2003, suffers from the same problem. Lee‘s warm and mature voice delivers a message of encouragement, but the song’s power is diminished when delivered in IU‘s ear-tickling voice. “Last Night Story,” a remake of the 1988 hit by trio Sobangcha, is perhaps the most notable track from the EP. Instead of being a sugary fairy, IU experiments with rather deadpan and pouty vocals in the upbeat retro song, morphing into a late-night party girl who bemoans the previous night. One is glad to hear a song that fits the singer, finally making IU sound and look more her age. Other covers such as “Sleepless Rainy Night,” originally by Park Kwang-hyun in 1990 and made famous by Kim Gun-mo in 1992, and “Everyday With You” by ’80s icons Deulgukhwa, don’t sound that different from covers by other artists. And IU’s vocals, although flawless, are still too shallow for “Rapids,” a mournful poetic ballad by Jeong Mi-jo from 1972. The six cover songs that revisit the ‘60s to the early 2000s are well made and diverse, but IU may have been too ambitious in her bid to pay homage to the old classics she admires.

The unidentified person had posted a photo of a wrist and a knife, saying he or she would violently murder Mina if she did not mutilate her supposed boyfriend. It was later revealed to have been a practical joke of extremely poor taste. But JYP Entertainment said there will be ”no mercy” for the perpetrator and vowed legal action in what is the latest in a long line of crimes against Korea’s idol singers.  K-pop‘s biggest stars have been threatened before. In April, IU said she planned to pursue legal actions against a local YouTuber for sexual harassment. The YouTuber in question made sexual comments about the female singer, comparing her to his dog in the videos. IU’s agency Fave Entertainment pledged “strong response without mercy.” The offenders most often offer the excuse that they were merely joking. The offender in the IU case said he was a fan and the comments had been taken out of context. His words and supposed apology, however, were muddled by a more recent video of him licking IU’s photo attached to a liquor bottle. The person who threatened Mina also posted an apology and said the disturbing post was made “just to become popular” online, and that he or she had not regarded the fear it would cause the victim. In a 2006 ruling, the Supreme Court clarified that the perpetrator’s actual intent or carrying out of the threat was not necessary to constitute a threat. This means that it is possible for the aforementioned internet user to be convicted regardless of whether or not he or she had actually intended to harm Mina. Making threats is punishable by up to three years in prison or 5 million won ($4,440) in fines, according to Korean law. Sometimes a death threat goes beyond simple internet trolling. In March, an unidentified person claimed he or she would shoot Jimin of boy band BTS to death during the band’s concert in California, along with a detailed layout of the seats and a picture of a gun. Although nothing happened at the venue, the incident had BTS and fans alike on edge. Later in the month, a man was caught secretly videotaping Yerin of K-pop group GFriend during a fan meeting. Unlike in the past when singers and their agencies attempted to address such issues quietly -- due to concerns about their public image -- more celebrities are now taking firm stances against ill-intended and often illegal actions against them. Group Apink’s Plan A Entertainment agency last month said it had filed criminal charges against internet users who posted malicious comments about member Son Na-eun. Plan A said Apink will no longer put up with such slander “because they are celebrities,” and filed charges against commenters as a “severe warning to those who insult others without an iota of guilt.” By Yoon Min-sik()",iu,4.0,"The article directly mentions IU and discusses a specific incident where she pursued legal action against a YouTuber for sexual harassment.

According to a recent report released by the Korea Creative Content Agency's (KOCCA) U.S. office, Korean TV series, particularly romantic comedies, are riding a huge wave of popularity among women in their teens to early 30s in America. The report is based on an online survey conducted by the KOCCA on 4,753 Korean drama fans in the U.S., which is double the number of respondents in the last survey conducted in 2014. The results were broken down by age, ethnicity and gender. Young internet users dominated the survey - 38.5 percent were ages 16 to 20, 21.9 percent were 20 to 25, 13.1 percent were 26 to 30 and 7.7 percent were in their early 30s, making up 73.5 percent of the total respondents. Asian viewers led the pack with 25.5 percent, trailed by 25.1 percent Hispanics, 24 percent white and 9 percent African-American. Compared to the previous survey, white fans have significantly increased, climbing to third place. Most Korean drama fans, 95.1 percent of them, used online streaming services to watch subtitled series. DramaFever turned out to be the most popular platform with 63.9 percent, followed by Viki with 19.1 percent and Netflix and YouTube each recording 2.8 percent. More than half of the respondents -- 59.8 percent -- said they have been watching Korean dramas for more than three years, while 13.7 percent said it had only been two to three years and 13.65 percent one to two years. The study reflects Korean dramas' ongoing popularity, racking up 87.1 percent of avid fans who have been watching for more than a year. When it came to genre, romantic comedies were by far the most preferred recording a whopping 72 percent. Melodrama lovers came in second with 11.7 percent, trailed by historical dramas recording 9.9 percent and crime or action with 9.2 percent. The most enjoyed dramas reflected the participants' taste. The top five dramas among U.S. viewers were romantic comedies, with ""Descendants of the Sun,"" at the top, followed by ""Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo,"" ""Cinderella and Four Knights"" and ""Oh My Venus.""

At her solo concert in Seoul on Saturday, the 22-year-old singer-songwriter performed the controversial song, “Zeze,” explaining to the audience that she “still dearly loves it.” A track on IU’s latest EP “Chat-shire,” the song is named after the boy protagonist of Portuguese novel “My Sweet Orange Tree.” Its self-written lyrics have been the target of criticism, with some critics viewing them as “hinting at pedophilia.” That the singer had described the character Zeze as “sexy” in a separate interview also became a point of debate. IU was unperturbed, however, as she sang the piece in front of around 6,000 audience members at Saturday’s concert at the Olympic Hall in Seoul, in what was to be the opening of her domestic tour. IU started off the concert with “Shoes,” from her latest mini-EP “Chat-shire,” followed by “Everyone has secrets,” “Obliviate” and “Red Queen,” leading up to “Zeze,” the fifth in the song lineup.

At the center of the controversy is “Zeze,” a track on the young starlet’s latest album, “Chat-shire,” released last month. The song was inspired by 5-year-old boy character Zeze in the novel “My Sweet Orange Tree,” written by Brazilian author Jose Mauro de Vasconcelos. The song “Zeze,” written from the viewpoint of the orange tree, includes lyrics that some claim are sexually suggestive, such as: “Zeze, hurry and climb up the tree / kiss the leaves,” “If you hurt the tree, bad, bad,” “Take the youngest leaf here / Pick the only flower / Climb up me / Climb up me,” “You’re very naive / but certainly sly,” “You might seem transparent like a young child / but something about you is dirty” and “tomorrow night, will you come see me again.” Explaining the song, the 22-year-old singer has said: “Zeze is innocent but cruel in some aspects. He is a character with many paradoxes, which is why I felt he was charming and sexy.” In the novel, which is featured in the Korean sixth-grade curriculum, Zeze is an imaginative but misunderstood 5-year-old boy who is physically abused by his family and comes to befriend an orange tree. Korean commenters online as well as critics, academics and artists are largely divided over the issue, with some defending the young starlet’s freedom of artistic expression and others claiming a line must be drawn when it comes to literary interpretation suggestive of pedophilia. Dongnyok Publishing Co., the publisher of the Korean translation of “My Sweet Orange Tree,” called IU’s interpretation of the child character “wrong” and raised concerns over a young character being portrayed as a sexual being. “It is a great pity that (IU) considered the 5-year-old Zeze to be a sexual subject. Freedom of expression has to be achieved in light of public sympathy,” the company said in a statement. Some, such as writer and critic Heo Ji-woong, defended IU’s right to freedom of interpretation and secondary creation. “It is not right for a publishing company to offer a strict guideline for literary interpretation,” he wrote on his social media handle, adding, “all literature is continually being newly discovered atop the interpreter’s freedom and capacity.” Novelist Kim Jae-won countered the argument, saying “Taboos exist even in art,” while others pointed out the lack of literary logic in connecting the character Zeze with sexuality. IU has since issued an official apology through social media, saying: “I swear I did not write the lyrics with the intent to sexualize a 5-year-old child.” She further apologized for using the word “sexy” in the context of children, and asked that the character in the song be thought of as inspired by, but independent from, the character in the novel. Even after the apology, outrage persists among some online commenters, who have started a public petition to dispose of all copies of the album. “IU has herself been sexually objectified in the pop industry. ...That does not give her the excuse to sell the sexuality of ... children, who are even weaker than her,” a Facebook user surnamed Han wrote in a lengthy post. Another user, surnamed Kim, pointed to the irony in the public’s willingness to “consume IU’s Lolita-like image” while blasting her for “identifying with” a precocious young character.　 By Rumy Doo ()",iu,5.0,"The article is directly about IU (mentioned multiple times), focusing on controversy surrounding her work as a singer-songwriter with her song ""Zeze"" from her album ""Chat-shire.""

They can’t work in this system.” Musical artists agree with this. “It’s definitely not a market that’s structured to be favorable for artists,” said the vocalist of an indie rock band, speaking to The Korea Herald on condition of anonymity. The singer said her band, as well as other bands she has spoken to, has had bad experiences with distributors and platforms that were taking artists for granted. “It would be really difficult to get someone on the phone to change incorrect information about us on the site, or to remove our songs altogether.” For a while, she said that her band even considered not distributing their songs in Korea at all. “We don’t even make that much off streaming,” she said, noting that music streaming platforms take 40 percent of the streaming revenue. “We said, we don’t need it, take the songs down.” But there are not many other options for indie artists to make an income, she said. She and industry insiders like Lee Youn-hyuk, head of secretariat at the Record Label Industry Association of Korea, said the way digital music is consumed in Korea is a root cause of why only certain artists can succeed in the digital music environment. “Most people consume music by listening to the top 100 songs on the charts, although that’s difficult to prove quantitatively because every music streaming service is different,” Lee told The Korea Herald in a telephone interview. “Since most people don’t look for songs outside of the top 100, the charts become very conservative. The same songs are consumed over and over again, making it hard for new songs to break in.” As of Thursday, five of the top 10 songs on the real-time charts from Melon, the largest digital music servic provider, are from one album -- IU’s “Chat-Shire,” which was released Oct. 23. Two other songs are from idol stars -- Taeyeon’s “I,” released Oct. 7, and f(x)’s “4 Walls,” released Oct. 27. One song is from a drama soundtrack, and the remaining two are from Lim Chang-jung and Zion.T, both of whom are known for their megahits with each new album. The reason for this pattern of consumption has a lot to do with price. Digital music platforms in Korea all offer unlimited streaming packages at about 6,000 won ($5.25) a month. It is only another 2,000 won to 3,000 won to add unlimited mobile downloads for music. At this price point, consumers do not feel the need to carefully curate their listening choices. “Labels will often talk about switching between distributors in order to gain an edge with platforms, either through playlist recommendations or special mentions,” said Lee. “But even that’s only for artists and labels that have a bit of pull. For new faces, it’s a nonstarter.” While acknowledging the difficulties presented by the current digital market situation, both the anonymous vocalist and Lee noted the artists could also do more on their end to improve the situation. “We write and produce all of our own music, meaning that we sign our own contracts for distribution,” said the vocalist. “That’s the only reason we know all these problems with distribution rights. Most artists don’t know about this kind of stuff.” Lee added that artists in Korea need to study up. “A lot of indie artists abroad do the promotional work themselves. They hire someone to do that for them only when they’ve reached a point in their music where both they and their label can make income together,” Lee said. “You can’t eliminate market economics from music, especially pop music.” “Artists have to know how their music will reach and be consumed by listeners. If they can’t figure it out themselves, they need to know how to find good partners that can help them,” he added.　 By Won Ho-jung ()",iu,3.0,"The article mentions IU specifically in relation to her album ""Chat-Shire"" dominating 5 of the top 10 positions on Melon's charts, demonstrating her success in the Korean digital music market.

Dubbed “the most anticipated show of 2015” by industry insiders, the new KBS drama will take us behind the scenes, revealing all the craze of overnight editing and endless meetings that go into producing variety shows, and promises light-hearted fun and laughter on the way. The drama marks actor Kim Soo-hyun’s return to television after a one-year hiatus since the mega-hit drama “My Love from the Star.” In complete contrast to his role as charismatic alien Do Min-joon, this time, Kim will play a principled, book-smart rookie producer named Baek Seung-chan, who is painfully inarticulate, clumsy and not at all street-smart. “Everybody was a rookie at some point in their lives,” said Kim in a press conference in Seoul on Monday. “So my goal is to let people relate to my character and remember that time.” “He’s entirely clueless,” said Kim on his endearingly awkward role. “But he tries so earnestly not to be clueless, but that ends up irritating his superiors even more.” In the show, Baek is constantly berated by Tak Ye-jin, the temperamental producer of popular music program “Music Bank.” Played by actress Gong Hyo-jin, Tak gives rookie employees a hard time with her straightforwardness, but is ultimately “human,” said Gong, and does her fair share of comical blundering. “It’s the most aggravated, neurotic role I’ve ever taken on,” said the actress famed for sparking romantic chemistry in dramas like “Pasta” and “It’s Okay, That’s Love.” “In the first episode, there are almost no scenes of (Ye-jin) smiling. She’s dissatisfied with everything, always telling people what to do ... but she’s imperfect and human, and writer Park Ji-eun makes her so charming.” Alongside Gong’s character will be the hot-headed but soft-hearted variety show producer Ra Joon-mo, played by actor Cha Tae-hyun, who is well-loved for comic roles in box-office hits such as “My Sassy Girl” (2001). It was easy for the seasoned actor to imagine himself on the other side of the scene. “I’ve done so many things during the course of my career in the entertainment industry ― I’ve been a singer, an emcee, I’ve done radio and variety shows. I realized I’ve absorbed so much from all these experiences without even thinking about it,” said Cha. Completing the star-studded cast will be singer-actress IU, who will play the haughty pop diva Cindy ― nicknamed “ice princess” for her complete emotional command and icy demeanor. The singer said she observed and took tips from fellow singers to prepare for the role, but was also surprised at how similar the character was to her real-life self. “Everyone has that irritated, touchy side to them,” she said, explaining that she was able to relate to the character’s biting attitude. “But Cindy is not all mean. The more I study her, the more I learn that she’s an innocent soul.” IU added that she is writing a song based on the character. The drama has numerous references to real producer-directors like Na Young-seok and celebrity cameo appearances, including singer-producer and chief of JYP Entertainment Park Jin-young. Helmed by comedy and variety show producer Seo Soo-min and penned by “My Love from the Stars” writer Park Ji-eun, “The Producers” will air Fridays and Saturdays at 9:15 p.m. starting May 15 and continue for 12 episodes, with each episode lasting 70 minutes.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/491136,Will ban on underage alcohol model reduce underage drinking?,2015-05-07,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2015/05/07/20150507001135_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"A heated debate is intensifying in the alcoholic beverage industry as a revised bill to ban models aged 24 or under from appearing in liquor advertisements is awaiting final approval from the National Assembly. The controversial bill is dubbed by news media as the “IU law,” referring to popular singer-songwriter IU. The 22-year-old has been starring in Chamisul soju ads since late last year. The debate started in 2012 when a ruling party lawmaker proposed a revision to the national health promotion law to ban celebrities aged 24 or less from appearing in alcohol ads. Offenders would face up to a one-year sentence or a 10 million won ($9,180) fine. The bill gathered and was out of the public’s focus for years, until the parliamentary health and welfare committee unexpectedly decided to have it passed. The age of an adult as stated by the civil law is 19, so those who have reached the age can legally purchase and consume alcoholic beverages. But the youth act defines ‘youth’ as those aged between nine and 24. So, should the bill be enacted, young adults aged between 19 and 24 will be allowed to drink alcoholic beverages but cannot promote them in the market. Also, the revision bill would be at odds with the regulations on televised commercial deliberation, which states that those aged 19 or older can star in alcohol ads. Despite controversies, advocates of this bill claim that underaged drinking models may have a negative influence on teenage drinking and thus should be restricted. “Countries such as the U.S. and Britain already have similar bans, and they stop people aged 25 or less from starring in liquor ads,” said an aide to the ruling Saenuri Party lawmaker Rep. Lee Elisa, the initiator of the bill. But Lee’s team admitted that the corresponding overseas regulations are nonbinding and self-regulatory. Attempting to add momentum to the faltering bill, a number of conservative Christian civic groups held a rally in front of the National Assembly earlier this week, demanding quick parliamentary approval. “The frequent appearance of young adults in drinking ads may have a negative impact on teenagers, who tend to value their peers,” said an official of the Civil Solidarity on the Prevention of Addiction. Alcohol manufacturers, however, remained poised, especially as the legislation and judicial committee spoke against the idea, claiming that the effect of the ban was uncertain. The excessive restriction may also infringe on the models’ freedom of occupation, according to the committee. “Even if the law revision did take place, it will take months until actual effectuation,” said an official of Hite Jinro, the nation’s second-largest alcohol company. “Our contract with IU will end by then in any case so we have time to watch the legislative moves and decide on our next action.” Hite Jinro is the manufacturer of Chamisul soju, as well as Hite beer, which had hired figure skating star Kim Yu-na back in 2012, when she was in the disputed 19-24 age group.

Following the announcement of his long-awaited return to the public eye, the singer has been dominating music headlines over the past several months, publicizing random sneak tidbits of his upcoming album “Quiet Night,” and a large-scale concert performance. After his months of hinting, Seo finally unveiled both versions of “Sogyeokdong,” the prerelease singles off his soon-to-be-released ninth studio album. It was previously announced that the single would come in two versions; the first version of the track was performed and sung by popular K-pop starlet IU and was released online on Oct. 2, while the second version, sung by Seo himself, was released 10 days later on Friday. The vintage-sounding electronic pop song features the artist’s classic soft-spoken ballad vocals and in just two days, the track’s music video had racked up more than half a million views on YouTube. Seo and IU’s agencies said they had been secretly working on the track for months, trying to keep fans in the dark as much as possible about the collaborative project. IU’s version went on to top all nine major online music charts shortly after its release, while Seo’s release marks a comeback after a five-year hiatus. The 42-year-old former Seo Taiji and Boys’ leader, who is often credited as one of the most influential figures in the development of Korean popular culture and the K-pop genre, is now gearing up for what is expected by many to be one of the biggest K-pop concerts of the year. Seo’s concert will be held in Seoul on Oct. 18 at the Jamsil Sports Complex’s Olympic Stadium. The show is said to be a Christmas-Halloween theme fusion concert titled “Christmalowin,” with Seo Taiji Co. officials previously stating that they are pulling out all the stops for the upcoming concert, which they have referred to as a “blockbuster” event. Last week, officials revealed that IU will also be joining Seo on stage for a collaborative performance of the two’s “Sogyeokdong” single.

The upcoming song is a collaborative track by the five original members of Ulala Session ― consisting of Lim, Kim Myung-hoon, Park Seung-il, Park Kwang-sun and Koonzo (who joined the group in 2012) ― and popular female singer IU. The single contains the voice of Lim, who passed away last year after battling gastric cancer for several years. Titled “Anxious Heart,” the collaboration is a bright and harmonious song that fuses the different vocal colors of Ulala Session and IU, according to Ulala Company. It was recorded back in 2012, while Lim was receiving treatment and fighting cancer, according to officials. Though the song had been scheduled to release in 2013, it was put on hold indefinitely following Lim’s death in February 2013. The song’s producer, The Lyrics, decided to delay the track’s release to the following year, in the hopes that Lim’s passion for music would not be tainted by commercial concerns. The new single is slated to hold a special meaning for many fans of Lim and Ulala Session, given that it is Lim’s last official track recorded before his death. Ulala Session rose to prominence after winning Mnet’s audition program “Superstar K” in 2011. The group impressed viewers with its soulful vocals and impressive performances, becoming the talk of the town during the show’s running.

For every track, IU keeps a careful balance between preserving the song’s original sentiments and altering the original with her own color and arrangements. Age does not seem to preclude the 21-year-old singer from reviving old classics released even before she was born. The lead single “My Old Story” is a remake of the 80s singer-songwriter Cho Duk-bae’s original, which portrays a boy reminiscing about a past love. IU sings yearningly as if she is reciprocating the boy’s original message. A mix of piano, strings and accordion imbue the song with an analogue feel. IU’s arrangement of the late Kim Gwang-suk’s “Flower” features a slow classic guitar tune alongside the young singer’s intensely poignant vocals. On the other hand, “Pierrot Laughs At Us” on her album has a lighter, groovier melody that adds a jazzy touch to the original sung by Kim Wan-sun. “The Meaning Of You” is a true mix of the old and the new, as Sanullim’s vocalist Kim Chang-wan, who sang the original, is featured alongside IU. A special narration by Clone is featured in “Boom Ladi Dadi” as well. All in all, IU’s new covers album provides a pleasant, calming respite from the mainstream music of today’s times. (jiyoung.sohn@heraldcorp.com) Mariah Carey an elusive, uneven chanteuse  Mariah Carey  “Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse”   (Def Jam) Mariah Carey’s latest album kicks off in wonderful and typical Mariah form: She sings a song that immediately pulls you in, which has ranged from a killer club jam to a searing slow song in the past. “Cry,” a torching, emotional tune, is the song that does its job on “Me. I Am Mariah ... The Elusive Chanteuse.” You feel like you are about to experience musical bliss, and most of the time Carey has been able to hit it out of the park. But like many veteran all-stars, there comes a time when singers make more errors and can’t score a hit like they used to. Sadly, that is what is happening with Carey. The batch of tracks on her 14th record are enjoyable, but they don‘t have the pizazz and spark of her past albums, including 2009’s “Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel,” her worst-selling album, though musically it was one of the year’s best works. “Elusive Chanteuse” borrows from Carey’s earlier work ― and while the powerful singer still has the vocal chops, her songs find her looking too much to the past.

That would be a mistake. These songs capture the world through the eyes of a 26-year-old, with all of its complicated contradictions. As such they‘re modest and ambitious, bold and shy, intimate and grand. They’re conversational, confessional and confident, free of frills and full of good advice. As a bonus, one of them rhymes “Fauntleroy” with “La-Z-Boy.” These songs have been performed in coffeehouses and at festivals, on a cruise ship and at the Grammys pre-show, where Fullbright‘s studio debut competed against Mumford & Sons, Bonnie Raitt and others. Their descendants date to the 1970s, when singer-songwriters ruled the pop charts, and also the 1930s, when timeless tunes came from an Oklahoma troubadour named Woody Guthrie.

One of the most anticipated awards ceremonies in Asia, MAMA attracts some of the top names in the K-pop and Korean entertainment industry; however, officials at CJ E&M have stated that it is continuing its attempts to turn the awards ceremony into a more internationally recognized event. “As Stevie Wonder’s appearance this year demonstrates, 2013 MAMA is much more than a simple music awards show, but a true festival uniting Asia through music and culture, and promoting a message of hope throughout the world,” said Mnet production director Shin Hyung-kwan in a press release. The awards show recognizes the year’s most popular music acts and gives fans the opportunity to vote for their favorite nominated artists. Some of this year’s nominees include G-Dragon, Psy, Cho Yong-pil, Lee Seung-ki and Lee Seung-chul battling it out for male artist of the year. Meanwhile, Baek Ji-young, Sunmi of Wonder Girls, IU, Ailee and Lee Hyori are contending for the title of this year’s best female artist.   Other nominees of the night include 2NE1, Girls’ Generation, Sistar, 4minute, f(x), EXO, SHINee, Shinhwa, Infinite, Lee Hi and Crayon Pop.

IU, however, said, “I felt I could do both.” “I was into the second week of activities for my new album when I received the synopsis, and it was great fun to read,” the 20-year-old singer-actress explained as to why she could not turn down the opportunity despite its overlap with her singing schedule. IU’s latest role, which she describes as a mash-up of her “Dream High” character and her “You’re the Best!” heroine, is a left-of-center, near-geek girl who pines for a handsome ladies’ man-in-the-making, played by hallyu star Jang Keun-suk. In the drama ― which is based on a comic book series ― Jang’s hero, Dokgo Mate, makes his way up the social ladder with the aid of 10 well-heeled women who are enamored with his striking good looks and charm. One can only guess that as he dates a string of wealthy socialites, Dokgo will eventually see the true swan in Bo-tong’s ugly duckling. Jang, himself, already sees the real thespian in IU. “She is like a veteran actress who has been honing her craft for years,” Jang, 26, said of working with her at the drama’s press conference on Monday. Since IU made her debut in 2008, she has proven herself well-steeled for all the fame and success that has come her way, displaying an even-keeled ability to intercept most any question with earnest, sometimes unexpected, answers. At the press event, IU answered questions regarding what kind of men she finds charming with ease, saying, “A man of many talents, and I do not mean someone who can carve out a lucrative career for himself, per se.” After a pause, she added, out of left field, “Like a guy who is exceptionally gifted at playing a short bamboo flute?” Amidst all the fun and laughter, IU shed some light on how she has kept it together throughout her rise to stardom. “After debuting I think it was smart to use a stage name,” said IU. “I can separate my personal from my public life.” The starlet, who turned 20 this year, elaborated that as IU, she has grown wiser and increasingly thoughtful about her work life. Conversely, as Lee Ji-eun, IU said she has been able to increasingly simplify her private life, dwell less on matters and stay true to her emotions and her personal relationships. “I think that is good,” she said. “Bel Ami” starts airing Nov. 20 Wednesday and Thursday nights on KBS 2 TV at 10 p.m. By Jean Oh ()",iu,5.0,"This article is highly relevant to IU as it directly focuses on her dual career as both a singer and actress.

Many are now questioning how these accusations will impact the future of the industry. Thanks to the infinite capabilities of the Internet, netizens have been exposing supposed plagiarism. “As bad as an accusation of plagiarism can be, the resolution of plagiarism in Korea might actually be far worse,” said one industry insider. “A false claim can seriously damage a person‘s career while a true claim can be very difficult to collect any sort of financial damages for.” The single “I Got C” was produced by Primary along with comedian Park Myung-soo for the newly released album “Jayuro Music Festival” by the members of popular MBC variety program “Infinite Challenge.” The single became a big hit, topping the local real time music charts. However, soon after the song’s release, netizens revealed that Primary’s track, along with several other tracks previously produced by the artist, bore striking resemblances to songs produced by David Schreurs. Schreurs produced Dutch singer Caro Emerald’s “Liquid Lunch,” from which the Korean hip-hop artist is accused of lifting the melody. “These days, there are more and more overseas producers, composers and songwriters expressing interest working with Korean music artists,” said the industry insider. “Although such international collaborations are becoming more commonplace in the industry, any time a high profile plagiarism case emerges, it never looks good.” The K-pop industry is no stranger to copyright infringement allegations, with some of the most notorious cases involving some of the nation’s biggest acts, including Big Bang leader G-Dragon and solo diva Lee Hyori. This year alone Primary is merely joining a list of other stars such as IU and Roy Kim, whom netizens have accused of having tracks that sound far too similar to other artists’ work. Netizens have raised plagiarism allegations against K-pop star IU’s lead track “The Red Shoes” from her recently released third studio album “Modern Times.” They claim the track sounds strikingly similar to German duo Nekta’s “Here’s Us,” an electro-jazz pop track released in 2009. Some netizens went as far as to compile a YouTube comparison clip of the two songs played back to back, with others even overlapping the tracks so listeners could hear them simultaneously, highlighting the similarities. Earlier this year Superstar K4 winner Roy Kim also found himself swept in a sea of plagiarism controversy surrounding his debut single “Spring Spring Spring,” which spent three weeks at the top of the Billboard K-Pop Hot 100. Online communities began posting comments after the single was released in April, accusing Kim of plagiarizing indie singer Acoustic Rain’s ukulele version of the song “Love is Canon.” After the news came to light, representatives of CJ E&M made a counter claim stating that it was Kim, in fact, whose work was being plagiarized. It was later revealed that the version of “Love is Canon” was in fact registered with the Korea Copyright Commission nearly one month after Kim’s “Spring Spring Spring” was released. There is also the issue of sampling, a common practice in hip-hop music, and how it differs from plagiarism. “When you sample something, you’re giving credit and getting permission from the original artist before the song is released,” said producer Bryan Park with company AMP Media. “Plagiarism is copying someone’s song and hoping no one notices or changing the song so that no one will notice.

Title track “The Red Shoes” showcases IU’s vocals in a cabaret-style setting, complete with blaring horns and lively percussion. Like many of the tracks on the album, vintage sounds and modern effects are put together artfully, forming a fresh but familiar compilation of songs. “Modern Times” has a distinct carefree feel that is reminiscent of jazz during the Roaring Twenties. “Everyone has Secrets” features Brown Eyed Girls member Ga-in and is a bossa nova number that mixes the two singers’ voices well. “Walk with Me, Girl” features veteran singer Choi Baek-ho and provides an interesting traditional Korean-sounding vocal into the mix. “A Gloomy Clock” features SHINee’s Jong-hyun and is one of the most modern-sounding tracks in the whole album. The track provides listeners with an interesting array of bubbling, ticking, whistling and xylophone sounds, making for a playful song. By Cha Yo-rim (yorimcha@heraldcorp.com) Miley Cyrus‘s new album shows promise   Miley Cyrus,   “Bangerz”  (RCA) Cyrus’ “Bangerz,” her fourth album, is a collection that marks the 20-year-old‘s musical breakthrough. The former “Hannah Montana” star kicks off the 13-track set with “Adore You,” a downbeat song about love. Other tracks that follow with that energy -- “Wrecking Ball,” “My Darlin” and “Somewhere Else” -- capture a more mature, nuanced side of Cyrus that we haven’t seen much of -- and that‘s a welcome change. When she explores the different emotions of her character and doesn’t play the caricature that she‘s become, you’re able to appreciate Cyrus as an artist. The Britney Spears-assisted “SMS (Bangerz)” and the Pharrell-produced “(hash)GETITRIGHT” are addictive, feel-good, up-tempo pop tunes; “FU” -- guess what it stands for -- has Cyrus semi-angry over a dramatic beat, and it makes for an overall punchy and amazing track; and “4x4,” featuring Nelly, is a pop-twang adventure. Even “Do My Thang” -- where Cyrus isn‘t too convincing as a rapper -- sounds good thanks to the groovy hook that she sings, and will.i.am’s Southern hip-hop-flavored beat. (AP) McCartney stays fresh, familiar on ‘New’ Paul McCartney   “New”   (Hear Music) For his 16th solo record, and first of original material in six years, Paul McCartney turned to a team of four hot producers to come up with something “New.” The result is both fresh and comfortably familiar. McCartney, a master of the catchy three-minute pop song, isn‘t reinventing himself here as the title may suggest. Just try listening to “On My Way to Work” or “Queenie Eye” without bobbing your head along to the beat. Really, love him or hate him, few can pump out these types of ditties quite like McCartney. Still, he’s no Bob Dylan. There are flirtations with material with some gravitas here, but it‘s just that -- a flirtation. Much of the credit for the success of “New” goes to McCartney’s four producers -- especially Paul Epworth (Adele) and Mark Ronson (Amy Winehouse). The other two, Giles Martin and Ethan Johns, are the sons of famous Beatles producers George Martin and Glyn Johns. While the multi-producer approach could have resulted in a hot mess, the end result is surprisingly cohesive, modern-sounding and, most of all, fun to listen to.

Some of next month’s highly anticipated releases include K-pop idols IU, T-ara, Nine Muses and Kim Jae-joong of JYJ. However, the list doesn’t end there: Other scheduled K-pop releases include new beats from groups such as Block B, Boys Republic, Monday Kids and others. Superstar rapper Psy previously stated that his upcoming studio album was to be released sometime this month, but no new updates have been announced regarding its status.  IU “Modern Times”   Twenty-year-old K-pop starlet IU will be shifting gears to a more mature and sophisticated sound and image with her upcoming third full album “Modern Times,” which will drop on Oct. 7. The soon-to-be-released 13-track album (which includes one bonus track) is said to feature songs of a wide variety of genres including swing, folk, bossa nova, Latin pop and more. “Modern Times” also contains two of the singer’s self-composed singles, titled “Voice Mail” and “A Day I Hate.” IU recently released a teaser clip of one of the singles from the new album titled “Between the Lips (50 cm).” The track has a European-style burlesque jazz sound to it, which is a big shift from the young singer’s K-pop roots.  T-ara “T-ara’s Effect” Despite the controversy that surrounded the K-pop idol group T-ara over the past year regarding member Hwa-young’s decision to leave the group because she was allegedly bullied by the other members, the remaining members are returning to the scene with the upcoming album “T-ara’s Effect.” Although rumors circulated that newest group member Dani would make her official debut with T-ara through the new album, the group’s agency Core Contents Media announced that this will not happen quite yet and that T-ara will be promoted as a six-member band for the time being. “T-ara’s Effects” is slated to be released on Oct. 10.  Nine Muses More than three years since their debut, the ladies of Nine Muses are finally gearing up to release the group’s first full studio album. The yet-to-be-titled album is scheduled to be released sometime next month. The women of Nine Muses made their debut back in 2010 with the track “No Playboy” from the group’s first single “Let’s Have a Party.” Since its debut, the group has released a string of singles but was oftentimes overshadowed by other more popular releases. In January, Nine Muses released its comeback single “Dolls” and landed a spot on the top 10 list of several local real-time charts, marking the group’s first strong release. The girls later released the sexy, electro-pop follow-up single “Wild,” along with the accompanying EP in May.  Kim Jae-joong   Idol star Kim Jae-joong of the JYJ trio is making his return as a soloist with the announcement that he is planning to release his first solo studio album at the end of October, according to a representative at C-JeS Entertainment. In January, Kim transformed himself into a rocker for the release of his solo debut EP album “I.” The five-track album topped the weekly charts in Korea as well as breaking the record for preorders in Japan. It has been reported that the artist’s first full studio album will be another rock-type album and Kim will be going on tour after its release. Although the star’s agency did not reveal the locations of the tour, it was announced that tour would not be exclusive to Korea.

'강남스타일'과 '젠틀맨'으로 역시 음원 강자로 우뚝 선 싸이도 연내 새 음반을 예고했다. 당초 이달 발매를 목표로 했으나 음반 작업 상황으로 인해 다소 미뤄진 상태다. 소속사인 YG엔터테인먼트 관계자는 ""지난여름부터 작곡가 유건형 씨와 함께 미국에서 음반 작업에 매진하고 있다""며 ""신곡 작업이 완성되는 시점에 맞춰 10월, 11월 등 글로벌한 출시 일정을 잡을 계획""이라고 전했다. 전속 계약 분쟁을 마치고 1년 만에 컴백하는 그룹 블락비가 오는 10월 2일 세 번째 미니앨범을 선보인다. 지난 23일 온라인에 먼저 공개한 수록곡 '빛이 되어줘'는 리더 지코가 만든 노래로 이날 일부 음원차트 1위 등 주요 차트 10위권에 진입했다. 뒤를 이어 10월 10일 걸그룹 티아라가 새 앨범으로 컴백한다. 팀멤버들의 탈퇴로 각종 구설에 올랐지만 그간 중독성 강한 노래로 음원차트 정상을 찍은 저력이 있고 새롭게 6인조로 컴백하는 만큼 화제성은 여전하다. JYJ의 김재중도 10월 말 솔로로 첫 번째 정규 앨범을 선보인다. 지난 1월 발표한 미니앨범 '마인(MINE)'이 록 장르임에도 리패키지 앨범을 포함해 20만 장의 판매량을 기록하며 탄탄한 팬덤을 자랑했다. 이번 앨범에는 한층 대중적인 록을 선보일 예정이어서 음원 차트 선전도 기대해볼 만하다. 이들은 앞서 후배들보다 음원 차트에서 다소 약세였지만 올해는 상반기 조용필, 이승철 등 중견 가수들의 앨범이 대중적으로 재조명 받은 해여서 새로운 돌풍이 기대된다. 계절적으로도 이들의 감성적인 음악이 맞아떨어지는 시기다. 신승훈은 10월 중순 미니앨범 '그레이트 웨이브(Great Wave)'를 낸다. 지난 2008년부터 시작한 3연 작 미니앨범 시리즈 '쓰리 웨이브스 오브 언익스펙티드 트위스트(3 waves of unexpected twist)'의 완결판이다. 소속사인 도로시컴퍼니 관계자는 ""녹음 막바지 단계로 믹싱, 마스터링 작업을 남겨뒀다""며 ""많은 시도와 변화, 다양성을 강조한 앨범""이라고 설명했다. 11월이 되면 이적이 5집을 낸다. 지난 2010년 4집 '사랑'을 발표한 이후 3년 만의 새 앨범이다. 이적은 최근 자신의 홈페이지와 트위터를 통해 앨범 작업 상황을 공개하고, 뮤직비디오 제작 현장 사진을 올려 궁금증을 유발했다. '토이'란 이름으로 앨범을 내는 유희열의 7집도 11-12월 중 출시된다. 지난 2007년 발표한 6집 '땡큐' 이후 6년 만에 발표하는 정규 앨범인 만큼 심혈을 기울여 작업 중으로 여느 때처럼 다양한 객원 보컬을 기용할 예정이다.   <관련 영문 기사>  Stellar lineup set to rock Korean music scene  South Korean singers, from idol groups to veteran singer-songwriters, are set to liven up the music scene here with a slew of new albums set for release before the end of the year. Indie band Busker Busker made a comeback with its much-anticipated second album Wednesday. All nine tracks swept the major music charts on the day of release. The group was unearthed by an audition program and enjoyed great success with its first album, filled with unique acoustic sounds and an analog aesthetic. Rap sensation Psy, who surprised the world with megahits “Gangnam Style” and “Gentleman,” is poised to return to the music scene with new album set for this fall. YG Entertainment, Psy’s agency, raised fans’ expectations, saying: “Many top world class artists participated in the new album.” Singer and actress IU has become a fixture on the charts with an array of hits. She will release her third album “Modern Times” on Oct. 3. The 20-year-old singer distinguished herself from other pop stars by bringing older generation musicians, such as Choi Baek-ho and Yang Hee-eun, to feature for the album. The competition among idol stars is expected to heat up throughout the autumn as well. With mini-album “Number 9,” girl group T-ara is out for a chance to bounce back from a bullying scandal, which has brought it much controversy and criticism. The group has been ranked fairly high on the local music charts with hooks and the new title song reportedly has a catchy melody. Block B, another idol band with a tough year, comes back to the stage on Oct. 2. The boy band has ended a year of legal battles over an exclusive contract with its former agency and unveiled “Be the Light,” one of the tracks, prior to the release of its third EP album, on Monday. The song is composed and written by the team’s leader Zico and it instantly topped some music charts on the day. Hallyu star and member of JYJ, Kim Jae-Joong, will release his first full album as a solo artist at the end of October. About 200,000 copies of his first solo EP, released in January, were sold, showing the power of his wide fan support across the Asia. The album will be a pop rock effort, according to his agency. Masters of sentimental ballads which are suited for the fall and winter season also joined the lineup. Shin Seung-hun, nicknamed “the prince of ballads.” returns with EP “Great Wave” in October. The 45-year-old veteran signer highlighted diversity and new approaches to music through the album, according to Shin’s agency Dorothy Company. Fans of the project group Toy have waited six years for new songs after its sixth album “Thank you” in 2007. You Hee-yeol who leads the group is said to be working with various guest vocalists as usual. The musician has not yet elaborated on details, but it is only known that the album will be released within this year.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/13375,'연기하는 아이돌' 랭킹 탑 7,2013-06-12,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2013/06/12/20130612000784_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"스크린에서 맹활약하는 아이돌들을 보는 것은 이젠 놀랄 일도 아니다. 그들에 대한 대중의 시선은 곱지 않았고, ‘연기자’ 보다는 ‘연기돌’ 이라는 수식어가 줄곧 따라다녔다. 그런 편견과 시선을 극복하고 ‘가수’와 ‘연기자’로써의 입지를 굳히고 있는 아이돌을 만나보자.  1. 박유천(JYJ) 2010년, 박유천이 처음 연기를 하겠다고 선언했을 때 사실 많은 사람들이 큰 기대를 갖고 있지 않았다. 하지만 그는 KBS2 드라마 “성균관 스캔들”로 브라운스크린에 첫발을 들이는 순간부터 이선준역을 훌륭하게 소화해냈다는 평을 들었다. 대중성을 지니면서도 너무 뻔하지 않은 캐릭터를 표현할 수 있는 퓨전 사극이라는 장르를 선택한 것은 어찌 보면 그에게는 최선의 선택이지 않았나 싶다. 차기 작품은 로멘틱 코미디 같은 말랑말랑한 소재로 안정적인 길을 선택했을 수도 있지만, 박유천은 기대와는 달리 정통 멜로 드라마를 택했다. 이다해와 호흡을 맞췄던 MBC 드라마 “미스 리플리”에서 진정한 연기자로 인정받을 수 있는 기회를 얻었고, 작년에 출연했던 SBS 드라마 “옥탑방 왕세자”와 올해 초 종영된 MBC 드라마 “보고싶다” 또한 그의 무한한 잠재력을 입증할 수 있는 작품이었다. 그는 연기 데뷔를 한지 3년만에 완벽한 연기로 호평을 받으며 KBS 연기대상, 백상예술대상, MBC 연기대상, SBS 연기대상까지 4관왕을 차지했다.  2. 이정신(CNBLUE) KBS2 주말드라마 “내 딸 서영이”가 처음 방영됐을 때, 이정신의 표정과 몸짓 하나 하나에서 그가 아무 경험 없이 처음 연기한다는 티가 조금씩 묻어 났다. 그는 잃을 것이 없었기에 남들보다 더 열심히 했고, 초반에 보였던 어색함을 뒤로한 채 50부작이 진행되는 동안 몰라보게 발전한 연기실력을 보여줬다. 발전보다 진화했다는 표현이 더 어울릴지도 모르겠다. 게다가 천호진, 김혜옥 같은 베테랑 연기자들을 옆에 두었으니 그 또한 시작하는 연기자에게 얼마나 좋은 환경인가. 이정신이 속한 CNBLUE의 나머지 멤버 3명이 먼저 연기를 시작했었던 것 또한 큰 자극이 됐을 것이라 생각된다. 그룹 리더 정용화는 이미 SBS 드라마 “미남이시네요”와 MBC “넌 내게 반했어”로 연기 호평을 받아왔기에 팀에서 마지막으로 연기 출사표를 던진 그에겐 부담이 더 컸을 것이다. 결과적으로 “내 딸 서영이”는 이정신에게 다양한 연령층의 팬을 확보함과 동시에 그룹 내에서 베이시스트로써의 존재감을 더 부각시킬 수 있는 계기를 마련해 주었다.  3. 아이유 2011년 KBS2 “드림하이” 방영 이후로 아이돌들의 스크린 진입이 그 절정을 달했다. 드림하이에서 이미 2PM 택연, 우영, 티아라 은정, 미쓰에이 수지까지 아이돌들이 대거 출동 했고, “드림하이2”에서는 티아라 지연, 씨스타 효린, 가희, 에일리등이 연기에 도전하게 됐다. 드림하이 시리즈가 배출한 가장 성공적인 스타는 단연 아이유와 수지다. 아이유의 비중이 많지는 않았지만 “드림하이""는 아이유의 연기 생활에 초석이 되어줬다. 현재 방영되고 있는 KBS2 주말 드라마 “최고다 이순신”에서는 ’캔디'같은 캐릭터로 많은 사랑을 받고 있다. 연기력에 대한 평은 엇갈리고 있지만, 아직도 20회나 넘게 남았기에 그녀의 발전하는 연기실력을 지켜보는 재미도 쏠쏠할 것 같다. 앞으로의 스크린 행보가 더욱더 기대되는 아이돌이다.  4. 서인국 서인국이 오디션 프로그램을 떠나 가수로써 무대에 섰을 땐 그닥 많은 주목을 받지 못했다. ”남자의 자격” 같은 예능에 출연하는 노력에도 불구하고 “슈퍼스타K에 나온 걔”라는 수식어가 꽤 오래 갔다. 데뷔한지 3년 뒤에 정은지와 함께 tvN “응답하라 1997”에 출연하면서 서인국의 운명은 바뀌기 시작했다. 드라마로 생긴 90년대 열풍을 타고 비로서 “슈퍼스타K에 걔”가 아닌 서인국이란 이름을 찾으며, MBC 주말드라마 “아들 녀석들”에서 연기자로써의 명성을 다지고 1년만에 가수의 자리로 돌아왔다.  5. 배수지(미쓰에이) “첫사랑” 아이콘으로 우뚝 선 수지. “드림하이”에서 연기에 발을 들였을 때만 해도 그녀가 2012년 ‘박스오피스 퀸’이 되리라고 누가 예상 했을까. 이용주 감독의 “건축학개론”은 411만명이 넘는 관객을 몰고 수지를 스타덤에 올려놓았다. 아직도 수지를 볼 때마다 영화 OST인 “다시 사랑한다 말할까”가 흘러나오는 것만 같은 기분이 든다. 그녀는 데뷔작의 영향을 아직도 받고 있긴 하지만 첫 결과가 너무 성공적이었던 탓일까? 작년에 방영됐던 KBS2 “빅”과 MBC “구가의 서”에서는 기대했던 만큼의 성과는 못보이고 있다. 그래도 당분간 다른 여배우들과 아이돌들이 수지의 “첫사랑 아이콘”을 넘보기는 힘들 것 같다.  6. 최시원 최시원은 슈퍼주니어로 데뷔하기 전 KBS2 “부모님 전상서”에 출연하면서 연기자로써 먼저 얼굴을 알렸다. SBS 드라마 “천일의 약속”과 KBS2 드라마 “엄마가 뿔났다” 같은 수많은 히트작을 배출했던 김수현 작가의 드라마에서 연기의 첫발을 들인 그는 스크린과 TV를 오가며 필모그래피를 쌓았다. 그러던 그는 작년 11월부터 방영했던 SBS “드라마의 제왕”에서 제대로 빛을 내기 시작했다. 4차원적인 한류 스타 캐릭터를 소화해내면서 연기자로써도 전혀 손색없는 모습을 보여줬다. 연기에 지속적인 관심을 보여온 최시원이 진정한 “드라마의 제왕”이 될지는 지켜볼 일이다.  7. 김동완 김동완 또한 신화로 데뷔하기 전 MBC 드라마 ”산""에서 연기를 시작했다. 신화로 활동하는 와중에도 지속적으로 스크린에 얼굴을 비추며 경험을 탄탄히 쌓았다. 특유의 ‘스마일 페이스’로 2002년에는 KBS2 “천국의 아이들”에서 주인공 기호태 역을 맡았고 그로부터 4년 뒤엔 박선영과 함께 KBS2 “슬픔이여 안녕”에서도 주연으로 출연했다. ’1세대 아이돌‘인 그는 오랜 노력 끝에 비로소 2011년 MBC 광복절 특집 2부작 “절정”이라는 작품에서 이육사 역을 연기하게 됐고 이 드라마는 휴스턴국제영화제(WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival) 특집극 부문에서 대상을 받았다. “절정”이 김동완에게 기존 연기 스타일을 더 다듬고, 연기자의 타이틀을 거머쥘 수 있는 하나의 전환점이 되어주지 않았나 싶다. 석지현 기자   (monicasuk@heraldcorp.com)     <관련 영문 기사>  Top 7 idol-turned-actors  There was a time when critics were not so generous in apprasing idol stars who took to acting on the big or small screen. While that prejudice is still alive, many of them have successfully overcome criticism to grow into full-fledged actors. 1. Park Yu-chun Not many people had high expectations for Park Yu-chun in 2010 when the singer said he would start acting. Park made his first appearance on the small screen with “Sungkyunkwan Scandal” and excelled at portraying Lee Sun-joon in the fusion historical drama. The selection of genre for his acting debut was perhaps an ideal one, as fusion historical dramas have historically had mass appeal. Park could have chosen the safe path of acting by choosing a romantic comedy as his follow-up project. Against his fans’ expectations, he decided to go for melodrama. With “Miss Ripley” costarring Lee Da-hae, he built his reputation as an actor. The last two dramas he starred in -- “Rooftop Prince” and “Missing You” -- also confirmed his talent for acting. Just three years into his acting career, the JYJ member garnered four major acting awards, in the KBS Drama Acting Awards in 2010, Paeksang Arts Awards and MBC Drama Awards in 2011, and SBS Drama Awards in 2012. 2. Lee Jung-shin It was evident at the beginning of “My Daughter Seo-young” that Lee Jung-shin was starting from scratch. Beginning from zero, he had nothing to lose, and he had veteran actors such as Chun Ho-jin and Kim Hye-ok as mentors. Leaving all the awkward reactions and facial expressions in the earlier part of the story, his acting skills remarkably improved through the 50-part series. Competition between the CNBLUE members could have been the strongest motivation for the bassist. All four band mates have experience in acting including leader Jung Yong-hwa, who played in “You’re Beautiful” and “Heartstrings.” With “My Daughter Seo-young,” the musician gained wider recognition as an actor as well. 3. IU The influx of idols in the K-drama sphere reached its peak in 2011 when “Dream High” first hit the airwaves. TV screens were brimming with young artists such as Taecyeon and Wooyoung of 2PM, Eunjung of Tiara and Bae Suzy of MissA. IU did not have many scenes in her debut drama but she made a stepping stone of it and landed her first lead role in “You’re the Best, Lee Soon-shin.” Already a successful singer, IU’s acting success is likely to be judged by her current drama and the next role. 4. Seo In-guk The winner of Mnet’s audition program “Superstar K” did not have much luck when he first made his debut as a singer. Seo In-guk had also tried appearing on variety shows to make himself known, but he was always tagged as “the guy from Superstar K.” His fate began to change forever when he starred in “Respond 1997” with Jung Eun-ji of girl group A Pink. Riding the waves of ’90s sensation the drama made, Seo finally kicked the label of “the guy from Superstar K” and found his real name. After making his appearance in the weekend series “Rascal Sons,” Seo came back to where he belongs and gained further popularity through a new album. 5. Bae Suzy Without a doubt, Bae Suzy is the most successful actress among idol singers. She gave acting a try in “Dream High” but no one had expected that she would become the queen of local box office last year. “Architecture 101,” Lee Yong-joo’s megahit film that lured 4.1 million moviegoers last year, launched Bae into stardom and gave her the nickname of “everyone’s first crush.” Although she still has that reputation from her debut flick, Bae has not been able to meet her fans’ expectations in “Big” and “Gu Family Book.” 6. Choi Si-won Choi Si-won made his name known as an actor before making his debut K-pop group Super Junior. His first drama “Precious Family” was written by popular script writer Kim Soo-hyun, who also wrote “A Thousand Days’ Promise” and “Mom’s Dead Upset.” After playing several minor and main roles both on the small and big screens he made a breakthrough in his acting career last year with “The King of Dramas.” Choi received positive reviews for depicting his character Kang Hyun-min, a handsome but short-tempered and egoistic actor. Proving himself a real heartthrob, he made a smooth start to become the king of dramas. 7. Kim Dong-wan Kim Dong-wan was an actor at the age of 17 before becoming a member of boy band Shinhwa. The “Hey Come On” singer kept his dream as an actor while pursuing singing activities. With his trademark smiley face he landed more roles in popular dramas such as “Children of Heaven” in 2002 and “A Farewell to Sorrow” in 2005. In 2011, Kim played the male lead in “The Peak,” set during the Japanese colonial rule. The two-part series was recognized by the WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival and took the grand prize in the TV Special-Dramatic segment. Critics say the award-winning drama provided Kim a chance to go beyond his former style of acting and helped him mature as an actor.

The organization, made up of some 30 Korean students studying abroad, filed a complaint with the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office against KBS for distorting the image of the famous Joseon-era general. The drama’s title contains the name of the heroic Korean figure, but the actual main character is a struggling female jobseeker whose name is also Lee Sun-shin. “Admiral Yi Sun-shin’s image of victory and courage is misleading as the female actress playing the role of Lee Sun-shin is portrayed to be clumsy and fragile,” said a member of DN.

HONG KONG (AFP) ― Thousands of fans flocked to a major K-pop concert in Hong Kong on Saturday, cheering an array of South Korean stars in the latest sign of the pop music phenomenon’s rising popularity.
Music Bank featured eight popular South Korean artists and was the largest K-pop concert to be held in the southern Chinese city.

상큼한 아이유의 미소! 홍콩도 접수
아시아 한류 열풍의 중심지 중 한 곳인 홍콩에서 23일 케이팝(K-POP) 그룹 8개 팀이 참가한 대규모 콘서트가 열렸다.
KBS 가요프로그램인 뮤직뱅크의 해외 녹화로 진행된 이날 공연에는 동방신기를 비롯해 원더걸스와 엠블랙, 비스트, 인피니트, 에프엑스, 아이유, 씨엔블루가 참가해 각자 3~4곡씩 히트곡을 홍콩 케이팝 팬들에게 선사했다.
공연은 7천500석 규모의 공연장인 아시아 월드 아레나에서 진행됐으며 스탠딩 관람객까지 모두 1만여명이 3시간가량 이어진 공연을 관람했다.
이날 공연에서는 특히 지난 1월 홍콩에서 단독 콘서트를 연 씨엔블루는 물론, 처음으로 홍콩에서 공연을 펼친 비스트와 인피니트가 관객의 큰 함성을 이끌어냈다.
이번 공연 입장권은 780~1천280홍콩달러(약 11만~19만원)로 비교적 고가였으나 KBS 측은 ""가장 비싼 표가 가장 먼저 매진됐다""고 밝혔다.
뮤직뱅크의 해외 녹화는 지난해 7월 일본 도쿄와 올해 2월 프랑스 파리 공연에 이어 이번이 세 번째다. 이날 공연은 다음달 6일 한국에 방송된다.
김인규 KBS 사장은 ""홍콩에 이어 다음 뮤직뱅크 해외 공연지로 브라질 상파울루 와 아랍에미리트(UAE) 두바이 등을 검토 중""이라면서 ""이와는 별도로 8월에 중국 네
이멍구(內蒙古) 자치구의 오르도스(鄂爾多斯)에서 케이팝 콘서트를 열 계획""이라고 말했다.
한류가 일찍 확산한 홍콩에서는 케이팝 공연이 자주 열린다. 올해는 상반기에 씨엔블루를 비롯해 소녀시대와 2PM이 홍콩에서 단독 콘서트를 열었으며 하반기에는 빅뱅의 콘서트가 예정돼 있다. 지난해 8월에도 인기 아이돌 그룹 8개팀이 참여한 대 규모 케이팝 콘서트가 열려 성황을 이뤘다.",iu,4.0,"The article directly mentions IU (아이유) multiple times and discusses her participation in a major K-pop concert ""Music Bank"" in Hong Kong.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10357723,KBS drama ‘Dream High’ nominated for European award,2012-02-29,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2012/02/29/20120229000924_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"S. Korean drama gets international attention for creativity, K-pop power
KUALA LUMPUR ― “Dream High,” a Korean musical drama co-produced and distributed by KBS was nominated on Tuesday in the youth category of Rose d’Or, a global television festival in Switzerland.
The Korean drama was the only Asian program out of 36 nominated for one of 12 different categories at the festival in Lucerne, which runs from May 7-10.
The drama that portrays the passion and agony of teens dreaming about becoming stars will compete in the festival against BBC’s “Leonardo, Wing and a Prayer,” and “You’re Not a Werewolf” by West German Broadcasting.
The BBC show is an action-packed mystery and drama series about a teenage Leonardo da Vinci, while the German program follows a problem-solving Wolfman who gives advice to struggling teens. More than 400 programs from around the world were submitted for nominations.
“Recently, Korean dramas as well as K-pop are getting popular not only in Asia but also in Europe and the Americas. I think the jury gave higher marks because the program effectively combined the two power factors,” Cho Dae-hyun, president of KBS Media, told The Korea Herald at the Nominees Night in Kuala Lumpur.
Cast of “Dream High” (KBS)
KBS programs have been nominated for the Golden Rose Awards since 2006. In 2010, two programs by KBS ― “My Too Perfect Sons” and “The Golden Bell Challenge” ― were nominated. However, none have ever won a prize.
Cho said this year will be different because of the growing interest in K-pop all over the world, as well as the quality and creativity of South Korean dramas, which have matured over the years.
“The Korean entertainment industry is the one of the most competitive markets in the world. We train actors and singers for many years to create quality dramas as well as entertainment programs. And also we collaborate with world-renowned experts,” Cho said.
“I know the Rose d’Or festival is putting more focus on programs from Europe and the Americas and hopefully it also will be the place where more Asian works can be introduced,” he added.
“Dream High,” aired in early 2011, was produced by Bae Yong-jun, an actor who achieved pan-Asian fame with hit drama “Winter Sonata.” Bae also starred in the series.
The drama features K-pop stars including Taecyeon and Wooyoung from boyband 2PM, Ham Eun-jeong from girl group T-ara and singer IU. It was also partly produced by Park Jin-young, singer and producer for JYP Entertainment.
“Dream High,” gained a viewers’ rating of over 20 percent in Korea, and was exported to more than 20 countries in Asia and in Europe, said Cho of KBS Media, a KBS affiliate in charge of both domestic and overseas sales of the broadcaster’s content.
The drama drew attention from many Asian TV producers and managers who attended the Rose d’Or’s Nominees Night event in Kuala Lumpur, its first official event in Asia. The Swiss-based festival aims to bring more Asian programs to its annual event.
“The answer is simple: Asia’s television market is the second largest in the world and it is growing fast,” said Marc Walder, CEO of Ringier Switzerland and Germany. Ringier Switzerland is the largest media company in the country and the parent company of the Rose d’Or.
Founded in 1961 in Montreux, the Rose d’Or Festival is now held in Lucerne, Switzerland, and is one of the world’s most prestigious entertainment television festivals. It has become a platform and a marketplace for TV professionals, producers, managers of private and public TV stations and production companies from all over the world.
An international jury of 50 experts selects three nominees in each category. The winners in the 12 categories ― including comedy, sitcom, game show, live event show and TV movie ― and the Best of 2012 will be selected by a final, 10-member jury.

IU, 18, introduced her first composition in the official soundtrack of hit TV drama “The Greatest Love.” The song, “Hold My Hand,” was released through an online digital music site on Wednesday.
IU
IU plans to further show off her talents as a singer-songwriter in her future albums. “IU has been practicing and learning how to write her own songs from the beginning of her debut. She’s very ambitious about it,” a person from IU’s agency said.
“We have a compilation of the songs she wrote with the help of composers and arrangers. We plan to distribute them through digital sources or include them on IU’s future albums.”
The new song, “Hold My Hand,” has a cheerful modern rock sound based on acoustic guitar with a band pitch-in. The song ranked first in the TOP 10 of popular music on the site it was released on.
IU’s new song is receiving attention amid the fervor for “I am a Singer,” a popular TV program where singers compete with other singers. Songs from the program have dominated the online charts.
IU debuted in 2008 with a mini album “Lost and Found.” She quickly rose to stardom through her appearances in hit entertainment shows and a teen TV drama. Her cute looks and powerful voice have gained her the nickname “the nation’s little sis.”
