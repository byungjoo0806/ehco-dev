For the eighth consecutive year, K-pop has been named the most prominent image associated with South Korea according to a global survey.
The 2025 Global Hallyu Survey, released Monday by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Korean Foundation for International Cultural Exchange, showed 17.8 percent of respondents said K-pop was the first thing that came to mind when they thought of Korea.
The survey was conducted across 28 countries from Nov. 29 to Dec. 27, 2024, targeting 26,400 people aged 15 to 59 who had experienced Korean cultural content. The Philippines and Hong Kong were included in the survey for the first time.
The second most common answer was Korean cuisine, which came to mind for 11.8 percent, followed by Korean dramas (8.7 percent), beauty products (6.4 percent) and Korean films (5.6 percent). For the first time since 2012, IT products and brands fell out of the top five with only 5.1 percent.
Among K-pop artists, 24.6 percent of respondents rated BTS as the most popular act, securing the band's spot at the top for a seventh consecutive year. Blackpink followed with 12.3 percent, marking its sixth consecutive year in second place. IU, Psy and Twice rounded out the top five, with 3.1 percent, 2.2 percent, and 1.8 percent, respectively.
The overall favorability rating for Korean content stood at 70.3 percent, up 1.5 percentage points from the previous year. The newly added category of Korean language recorded a favorability rating of 75.4 percent.
For the fourth year in a row, the Netflix original series ""Squid Game"" was named the most popular Korean drama, chosen by 9.7 percent of respondents. ""Queen of Tears"" followed with 6.5 percent, and ""Crash Landing on You"" came in third with 2.2 percent.
In the film category, ""Parasite"" directed by Bong Joon-ho maintained its top position for the fifth consecutive year with 8.3 percent. ""Train to Busan"" ranked second with 6.5 percent, and ""Exhuma"" came third with 4.1 percent.
Actor Lee Min-ho remained the most popular Korean actor for 12 consecutive years, chosen by 7 percent of the respondents. Actors Gong Yoo, Song Hye-kyo followed in second and third place, while the scandal-ridden actor Kim Soo-hyun secured fourth place.
The survey also highlighted the growing economic impact of Korean culture.
Among those who had experienced Korean content, 58.9 percent said they were likely to purchase Korean products or services in the future. This marks an increase of 8.2 percentage points compared to the previous year.
Furthermore, 22.1 percent said their reason for purchase was the product’s appearance in Korean movies or television shows, a 5 percentage point rise from the year before.
However, the survey also noted a rise in negative perceptions of Hallyu as its global influence expands. A total of 37.5 percent of respondents said they agreed with negative views about Korean pop culture, the highest figure in the past five years and a 4.9 percentage point increase from last year. The most cited reasons included excessive commercialization, concerns about North Korea’s international presence, and the desire to protect local content in their own countries.",kimsoohyun,3.0,"The article briefly mentions Kim Soo-hyun as the fourth most popular Korean actor, which directly relates to his occupation as an actor.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10456419,Kim Soo-hyun's 'Real' rides new wave of infamy amid scandal,2025-04-02,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/news/cms/2025/04/02/news-p.v1.20250402.586133405bb34e09a76d34feb07189c6_T1.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Korean cinema's notorious box-office bomb finds new viewership as questions about on-set conduct crop up
In a memorable scene from the 2017 film ""Real,"" for some time social media meme fodder here, Kim Soo-hyun, dressed in a garish red suit and mask, spins at hyperspeed like a malfunctioning wind-up toy. Glittering, iridescent water cascades across the screen as his enemies inexplicably collapse without him laying a finger on them.
This bizarre sequence epitomizes a film now catching a second wind amid an endless barrage of controversies surrounding its embattled star. As of Tuesday, ""Real"" -- a surrealist noir thriller starring Kim opposite late K-pop star and actor Sulli --ranked second on Netflix's Top 10 films in South Korea and broke into trending charts on local streaming platforms Tving and Coupang Play, an ironic comeback for a film once written off as among Korean cinema's greatest disasters.
This renewed interest comes as Kim finds himself mired in allegations that he dated the late actor Kim Sae-ron when she was a minor. With the controversy ongoing, Sulli's family members have stepped forward with their own grievances. On Friday, they put out a statement to local media seeking answers about troubling aspects of Sulli's intimate scenes in the film, claiming these sequences weren't included in the original script and that a body double, though present on set, wasn't used as planned.
The situation heated up when Lee Jung-seob, the film's original director who got replaced during production, broke his silence on social media, stating he ""had absolutely zero responsibility for how that film turned out."" Kim's agency, Gold Medalist, has only briefly mentioned that they are ""currently looking into the situation.""
A Troubled Production
From its inception, ""Real"" was a project plagued by complications.
The film drummed up substantial buzz even before hitting screens, reportedly working with an impressive 11.5 billion won ($8.6 million) budget with investment flowing in from China's Alibaba Pictures. The film marked Kim Soo-hyun's return after a two-year break following his star-making turns in television hits ""My Love from the Star"" (2014) and ""The Producer"" (2015).
The project also turned heads as Sulli's first major film role after leaving K-pop group f(x) in 2015 to focus on acting. Marketing materials put her participation in intimate scenes front and center, with promotional interviews openly stressing the absence of a body double in certain scenes -- a level of emphasis industry watchers found unusual for mainstream Korean cinema. Meanwhile, cameos from big names, including Suzy, Park Seo-junand Ahn So-hee further stoked anticipation.
Behind the scenes, however, roadblocks kept popping up. Originally set for simultaneous release in Korea and China, overseas distribution plans fell apart following economic retaliation from the Chinese government against South Korean firms after the deployment of a US missile system here. More troublingly, director Lee Jung-seob was abruptly shown the door mid-production due to alleged ""creative differences."" His replacement was Lee Sa-rang (now Lee Ro-be), Kim Soo-hyun's cousin and now head of his management firm, Gold Medalist. He reportedly had no prior directing experience.
Critical and commercial disaster
The resulting film bombed spectacularly upon release. Critics and audiences panned it, handing it a measly 39 percent rating on multiplex chain CGV's website and just 4.44 out of 10 from viewers on Naver. The film quickly earned its place as a modern classic of bad movies in contemporary Korean cinema, with clips of its most bewildering action sequences making the rounds on social media as objects of ridicule.
At its core, ""Real"" stumbles through fundamental narrative confusion. The convoluted plot about a casino owner's psychological struggle with his doppelganger never comes together into something ordinary viewers can remotely grasp. Visually, the film throws in neon-drenched settings and disorienting camera work that feels more like a skincare commercial than cinema. The action sequences laugh in the face of physics, while the dialogue often bears no relation to the scenes before or after it.
Viewers particularly took issue with the film's problematic portrayal of women. Many pointed to how female characters appear primarily as decorative elements, with little agency or purpose beyond serving as objects of sexual desire before meeting untimely ends. The explicit scenes, particularly those involving Sulli, kicked up immediate controversy upon release, with public criticism falling as much on the actor as on the production itself.
Broader industry concerns
The rekindled controversy may point to structural issues within Korean cinema regarding actor protections during intimate scenes.
Han Ji-eun, another actor who appeared in ""Real,"" opened up in a 2018 interview about her significant emotional distress during filming. Despite beating out 4,300 candidates after spotting a casting notice from Kim Soo-hyun himself, Han pointed out she had no one to turn to during difficult scenes. Most of her footage wound up strpped from the final film, leaving primarily her explicit scenes on screen -- an experience she described as causing ""serious after-effects.""
Unlike the US, where actors' union guidelines set clear protocols for filming intimate content, South Korea lacks formal industry standards protecting performers.
The country's main legal framework for film industry regulation, the Promotion of the Motion Pictures and Video Products Act, states in Article 3 that ""when concluding contracts with film workers, specific details regarding wages, working hours and other working conditions must be disclosed."" However, the catch-all term ""working conditions"" doesn't address the specific concerns of actors performing intimate scenes and often leaves them unknowing of how their footage will be used.
In 2018, former Democratic Party lawmaker In Jae-keun put forward an amendment to specify ""matters related to body exposure scenes, including exposed body parts, scene intentions and filming methods"" under the clause. This amendment, however, never passed, and the legislation remains in place without these protections.",kimsoohyun,5.0,"The article specifically mentions Kim Soo-hyun (김수현) multiple times, focusing on his role as an actor in the film ""Real.""

Calling the amendment to be coined the “Kim Soo-hyun Prevention Act,” the petitioner urged lawmakers to make an amendment to statutory rape laws to include ages 13 to 19. Currently, statutory rape laws in South Korea only protect those aged 13 to 16.
“The grooming sexual abuse committed by Hallyu star Kim Soo-hyun against then-child actor Kim Sae-ron has outraged the entire country,” wrote the petitioner. “Unfortunately, the current law only protects children aged between 13 and 16, meaning Kim Soo-hyun cannot be legally prosecuted.”
In addition to calling for the age threshold for statutory rape to be raised, the petition further calls for stricter penalties on sexual offenses against minors, including jail time of a minimum of two years for indecent acts and five years for cases related to rape.
As of 2 p.m. on Wednesday, the petition had gathered 33,643 signatures in support, after the petition was made on Monday.
Petitions on the National Assembly’s public petition system are available for the public to read and sign digitally for 30 days. If a petition receives over 50,000 signatures within the 30-day period, it is referred to the relevant National Assembly committee for review. Once the committee adopts the petition, it is presented to a National Assembly plenary session.
Meanwhile, Kim Soo-hyun has come under intense scrutiny following allegations of romantic involvement with the late actor Kim Sae-ron while she was underage. During Monday’s press conference, Kim denied all allegations of being in a romantic relationship with the late actor when she was underage, asserting that their yearlong relationship began in 2019 -- when she was 19 and he was 31 years old.

Actor Kim Soo-hyun is facing widespread backlash following his tear-filled press conference Monday held to explain his relationship with the late actor Kim Sae-ron, with a petition started to expand South Korea’s statutory rape protections.
Criticism from global fans flooded social media platforms such as X and online forums, including Reddit in the aftermath of the press conference. As of Tuesday, trending keywords on X included phrases like ""fake tears"" and ""King of Tears,"" a pointed play on the title of Kim's hit drama series, ""Queen of Tears.""
Domestic audiences also strongly criticized the actor for failing to clarify when his relationship with Kim Sae-ron began, not taking questions from reporters at the press conference, and newly surfaced evidence allegedly showing him at her house in 2018 during his military leave, when she was still a minor.
Some supporters argue that the public should wait for the outcome of Kim Soo-hyun's lawsuit against Kim Sae-ron's bereaved family and a YouTube channel that accused him of being involved with the actress when she was a minor. However, widespread skepticism persists, with many believing he is ""acting"" and failing to address the truth.
Amid mounting public outcry, a petition was submitted to the National Assembly Monday, urging lawmakers to amend statutory rape laws to include ages 13-19. The petitioner pointed to a legal gap, as the current law only protects minors aged 13 to 16, leaving older teenagers vulnerable.
The petitioner stated, ""The grooming sexual abuse committed by Hallyu star Kim Soo-hyun against the child actress Kim Sae-ron, who was a minor at the time, has outraged the entire nation. Unfortunately, the current law only protects children aged 13 to under 16, which means Kim Soo-hyun cannot be legally prosecuted.""
The proposal further called for stricter penalties for sexual offenses against minors, including jail sentences of a minimum two years for indecent acts and five years for rape.
The petition collected more than 10,000 signatures as of Tuesday. If more than 50,000 signatures are collected between Monday and April 30, the petition will be forwarded to the relevant parliamentary committee. Following a review of the proposed law, it could be presented at a plenary session of the National Assembly.
During Monday’s press conference, Kim Soo-hyun denied allegations that he was romantically involved with Kim Sae-ron while she was underaged, asserting that their relationship only began in 2019 when she was 19 and he was 31.

Kim Soo-hyun, the 37-year-old Hallyu star at the center of swirling rumors about his alleged relationship with Kim Sae-ron, held a press conference on Monday to emphatically state that he did not date her when she was a minor and that he had no involvement in her death.
At a press conference on Monday at a hotel in Sangam-dong, Seoul, Kim entered with a stiff walk and a tense expression.
""I think of myself as a coward. I always seemed to be too focused on protecting what I had,"" Kim said, his voice taut. ""I couldn't even trust the goodwill directed toward me. Always afraid of losing something or being hurt, it took me a long time to stand here.""
Kim went on to acknowledge that he dated Kim Sae-ron, who was born in July 2000, in 2019 for about a year.
Asked why he had denied their relationship a year ago in March 2024 after dating rumors surfaced following Kim Sae-ron's social media post featuring a photo of them together, the actor explained that with ""Queen of Tears"" airing at the time, he wanted to protect those around him.
""After becoming an actor, I received an overwhelming amount of love. I was someone who didn’t have much, but suddenly, I became someone with too much to protect,"" Kim said.
""Even while 'Queen of Tears' was airing, as a lead actor, there were so many things I had to protect. I kept wondering: What would happen if I admitted to having been in a relationship with someone years ago? How would it affect the actors performing alongside me, the staff staying up all night on set, the production company putting everything on the line for this project and the colleagues at my agency?
""Every time I faced a conflict between being Kim Soo-hyun the person and Kim Soo-hyun the star, I always ended up making choices as Kim Soo-hyun the star.""
The actor stated that even if given the chance again, he would make the same choice, as he believed he should not make a choice simply to ease his own heart.
Kim Soo-hyun further clarified that he did not date Kim Sae-ron when she was a minor. He also emphasized that her death in February was not a result of his turning away from her or his agency pressuring her over debts she had incurred.
""I am being pressured to confess to things I never did. They say, ‘You manipulated the deceased since she was a minor.’ ‘You pressured her with money and drove her to her death.’ ‘So, you are a murderer,'"" Kim Soo-hyun said through sobs, denying the allegations against him.
He refuted KakaoTalk messages that that had been presented by Kim Sae-ron's bereaved family as evidence, referring to a ""scientific analysis"" of KakaoTalk conversations purportedly from 2016 and 2018.
Kim Soo-hyun contended that the bereaved family of Kim Sae-ron fabricated the KakaoTalk conversations, and that the individual involved in the exchanges in 2016 and 2018 was not him. He said this was confirmed through a verification institution that had scientifically analyzed the KakaoTalk statements at his request.
Immediately after the press conference, Kim Jong-bok, an attorney from LKB & Partners and Kim’s legal representative, announced that Kim Soo-hyun and Gold Medalist, his agency, had filed a defamation suit against the bereaved family of Kim Sae-ron, along with a woman who has claimed to be Kim Sae-ron's aunt and the operator of HoverLab, a far-right YouTube channel.
""We have also submitted a lawsuit against the bereaved family of Kim Sae-ron, Kim Sae-ron's alleged 'aunt' and the operator of HoverLab seeking approximately 12 billion won ($8.1 million) in damages with the Seoul Central District Court,"" he said.
The press conference came in the wake of recent claims from HoverLab that allege that Kim Soo-hyun dated Kim Sae-ron for six years, starting in 2015 when he was 27 and she was 15. HoverLab has also accused Kim and his agency of driving Kim Sae-ron to her death, claiming they pressured her to repay a debt of 700 million won owed to the company.
Meanwhile, outside the hotel where the press conference was taking place, a parked truck displayed messages of support from Kim's fans in Brazil.

The bereaved family of Kim Sae-ron Monday sued a YouTuber for spreading false rumors about Kim Sae-ron while she was alive.
On Monday, attorney Bu Ji-seok of the law firm Buyou, representing Kim Sae-ron’s family, appeared at the Seoul Metropolitan Police to submit a complaint against YouTuber Lee Jin-ho for allegedly spreading false rumors about her.
Bu was accompanied by Kwon Young-chan, head of the Korea Association for Suicide Prevention, and Kim Say, head of HoverLab, the far-right YouTube channel that claimed Kim Soo-hyun and Kim Sae-ron had been allegedly dating for six years, starting in 2015 when she was 15.
At a press conference, Bu said Kim Sae-ron’s family is suing Lee for spreading a number of false claims since 2022, including that she staged a “self-made romance” by posting a photo of herself with Kim Soo-hyun in March 2024.
According to Bu, Kim Sae-ron uploaded the picture in a desperate attempt to have Kim Soo-hyun contact her after receiving a notice from Gold Medalist, his agency, urging her to repay a 700 million won ($483,000) debt. Gold Medalist was also Kim Sae-ron's agency until she left in December 2022 after her drunk-driving incident earlier in May.
""Kim Sae-ron suffered extreme distress after receiving the first certified notice (from her agency) and sent a message to Kim Soo-hyun, saying, 'Please save me.' When she did not get a response, she thought that posting on social media a photo taken while they were in a relationship might prompt a reply, which led her to upload the picture,"" said Bu. The photo was uploaded March 24, 2024.
Bu claimed YouTuber Lee had demeaned Kim by calling the photo a ""staged act"" and spread falsehoods. Thus, filing a complaint was unavoidable. ""After Kim Sae-ron's passing, Lee Jin-ho deleted (his) past videos, which is a clear attempt to destroy evidence,"" he added.
Bu said that the recently released photos of Kim Soo-hyun and Kim Sae-ron by HoverLab were aimed at disproving Lee’s claims. The photos were obtained from Kim Sae-ron's family.
“The bereaved family asks for understanding that they had no choice but to disclose the relationship (between Kim Sae-ron) and Kim Soo-hyun in order to prove that YouTuber Lee Jin-ho's claims were false and that they had to release photos of their romantic relationship in order to do so,” said Bu.
According to Bu, Kim Sae-ron received a second certified notice from Gold Medalist on March 25, 2024, again urging her to repay the debt.
""While (Gold Medalist) claims that it had no choice but to send the letter due to a breach of trust issue, in reality, it was essentially a demand for the deceased to repay the debt within a given period,"" stated Bu.
Bu also claimed the letter warned Kim Sae-ron not to contact Kim Soo-hyun or other agency actors and threatened legal action over the photo.
Kim Sae-ron’s family stated through Bu, ""It is impossible to even begin to imagine the psychological distress the deceased must have suffered after receiving such notices.""

The ""Queen of Tears"" star has been under intense scrutiny since March 10, when a YouTube channel first raised the allegations that he dated late actress Kim Sae-ron when she was a minor.
""We are well aware of the seriousness of the controversy and have been closely monitoring viewer responses"" it said, adding it will cut out Kim's screens ""as much as possible.""
The network said the decision was aimed at preventing any misunderstanding regarding the program's intent and to maintain audience trust.
Kim is a cast member of the music production show hosted by K-pop icon G-Dragon. Despite the ongoing scandal, Kim is said to have participated in filming last Thursday. MBC said it was awaiting an official response from his agency before making any further decisions on the matter.
On Friday, Kim's agency, Gold Medalist, acknowledged the two were in a romantic relationship for about a year but claimed that she was already an adult at that time.

The actor visited Bangkok for “2014 Kim Soo Hyun Asia Tour 1st Memories in Thailand” held at Siam Paragon on March 30, 2014.
“It is true that Kim played badminton then, but there was no coercive request by Kim to install a badminton court,” a former official at KCA Thailand told The Korea Herald through a source familiar with the matter on Sunday. “We would also like to clarify that other information circulating online regarding the badminton video and photos is not true.”
The incident in Bangkok has resurfaced following recent dating rumors involving the late actor Kim Sae-ron.
On March 11, a Thai X user claiming to have been an on-site staff member at Kim’s fan meeting 11 years ago, posted that he and his colleagues were forced to set up a badminton court inside Siam Paragon, an upscale shopping center in Bangkok, late at night on March 29 and 30, 2014. He alleged that staff had to clear the entire hall at the shopping mall to accommodate Kim’s request, reinstalling the seats after he finished playing.
According to the post, when Kim made the same request the following day, the staff suggested renting an outdoor badminton court, but Kim insisted on playing inside the shopping mall, citing privacy concerns.
“Staffers were watching with their eyes almost closed (falling asleep),” the user wrote on X. “From that day until today, I’ve waited so long for everyone to open their eyes. I still remember he said, ‘The net is not tight enough, can’t play, put up the net again.’”
The post was deleted shortly after it went viral.
However, the claim gained traction when an old video on YouTube showing four unidentified men playing badminton in a hall that appears to be inside Siam Paragon went viral.
On Sunday, the former KCA Thailand official acknowledged that Kim Soo-hyun was one of the men in the video.
Kim has enjoyed immense popularity in Thailand for his roles in hit TV dramas including “My Love from the Star,” “The Producers” and the recent “Queen of Tears.”
Meanwhile, Kim has been mired in controversy over allegations of a past relationship with the late actress Kim Sae-ron, rumored to have started in 2015 when she was 15.

Kim Soo-hyun’s agency, Gold Medalist, stated Friday in a press release that the actor began dating late actor Kim Sae-ron when she was an adult and was never personally involved in her financial matters.
The agency's statement came in response to allegations surrounding Kim Soo-hyun made by far-right YouTube channel, HoverLab. In a video uploaded Monday, HoverLab claimed that Kim Soo-hyun and Kim Sae-ron had been dating for six years, starting in 2015 when Kim Sae-ron was 15 and Kim Soo-hyun was 27.
Though the company had announced it would address the claims next week, it decided to release its official stance early due to concerns over Kim Soo-hyun’s psychological distress caused by the allegations.
""Gold Medalist has announced that it would release an official statement based on verifiable evidence, next week, to refute the claims made by HoverLab,"" the press statement read.
“However, early this morning, Kim Soo-hyun showed symptoms of significant psychological distress and the company took steps to ensure his absolute rest. After HoverLab's report, Kim Soo-hyun has been going through extreme stress due to claims that he is responsible for the sudden death of the deceased,"" it added.
The statement also detailed incidents of surveillance.
“Also, on Wednesday night after HoverLab's broadcast ended, a car with people holding cameras stood parked across from the company’s main entrance and in the parking lot until dawn, and by Thursday lunchtime, people with cameras were seen circling around the building, increasing the psychological pressure on Kim Soo-hyun.""
The agency cited this as a key reason for the agency's decision to release an early response.
According to Gold Medalist, Kim Soo-hyun and Kim Sae-ron dated from the summer of 2019 to the fall of 2020, after Kim Sae-ron became an adult. Kim Sae-ron was born in 2000, while Kim Soo-hyun was born in 1988.
They added that the photos of the two released by HoverLab were taken in 2019 and 2020.
The agency addressed the letter released by HoverLab was allegedly sent from Kim Soo-hyun to Kim Sae-ron while the actor completed his mandatory military service. In the letter, Kim Soo-hyun allegedly called Kim Sae-ron by the affectionate nickname ""Saero-naero"" and told her he missed her. The letters were dated 2018.
The agency emphasized that the letters were among those Kim Soo-hyun sent to close acquaintances during his military service and not letters sent between lovers.
The agency also denied claims that Kim Soo-hyun and Gold Medalist pressured Kim Sae-ron to repay a debt of 700 million won ($482,000), by sending her a certified notice demanding repayment.
HoverLab on Tuesday released a screenshot of a message Kim Sae-ron sent to Kim Soo-hyun, in which she pleaded for more time to gather money to repay a debt. This fueled speculation that financial pressure contributed to Kim Sae-ron’s passing on Feb. 16.
Gold Medalist denied the allegations, stating that the certified notice was not an attempt to pressure Kim Sae-ron but a necessary step to comply with legal and accounting regulations.
""If the company were to voluntarily cover the penalty fees (for Kim Sae-ron), there was a risk that the executives who made the decision could be charged with breach of trust, and the expenses might not be recognized as deductible business costs,"" the agency explained.
The agency strongly rejected claims linking the debt issue to Kim Sae-ron’s death, stating, ""Linking the cause of death to this incident a year later is difficult to accept.""
Gold Medalist also stressed that Kim Soo-hyun was never personally involved.

The agency of Kim Soo-hyun, the star of numerous hit K-dramas such as ""Queen of Tears"" and ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"" announced that it will issue an official statement regarding allegations that he was in a relationship with the late actor Kim Sae-ron since she was 15.
Kim Soo-hyun’s agency, Gold Medalist, stated on Thursday, ""To clarify the facts and address baseless rumors, we will present our stance next week, supported by clear evidence.""
The agency did not disclose specifics about the method or the timing of the statement.
The statement comes in the wake of claims from a YouTube channel that Kim Soo-hyun dated Kim Sae-ron for six years, starting in 2015.
Kim Sae-ron, born in 2000, was 15 years old when she allegedly began dating Kim Soo-hyun. At that time, Kim Soo-hyun, 12 years her senior, was 27. The report cited Kim Sae-ron’s family as its source.
On Monday, Gold Medalist strongly rejected the dating claims made by the YouTube channel HoverLab, a far-right outlet with a history of spreading malicious and baseless rumors.
The claims, first made Monday, were accompanied by the release of a photo on Tuesday showing Kim Soo-hyun kissing Kim Sae-ron on the cheek, as well as text messages that Kim Sae-ron supposedly sent Kim Soo-hyun, asking him to drop his lawsuit over the 700 million won ($481,541) she owed him.
These reports were followed by the release of letters on Wednesday that are believed to have been sent by Kim Soo-hyun to Kim Sae-ron in 2018 and 2019.
The letters reportedly include affectionate nicknames, with Kim Soo-hyun allegedly referring to Kim Sae-ron as “Saero-naero” and expressing affection toward her.
Amid the allegations, public sentiment toward Kim Soo-hyun has been souring in Korea. Scrutiny has intensified over the fact that Kim Sae-ron, who was found dead in her home on Feb. 16, died on Kim Soo-hyun's birthday.
In response to the public discontent, several retailers are debating whether to distance themselves from Kim Soo-hyun. Currently, Kim is a model for a slew of Korean brands, including Homeplus, Tous les Jours, K2, Dinto, Shinhan Bank, Prada, Jo Malone and Cuckoo.
Homeplus stated that it is reviewing whether to continue his modeling contract, while Tous les Jours, a bakery chain operated by CJ Foodville, said Kim's modeling contract will terminate this month. Tous les Jours added that the termination of Kim Soo-hyun's modeling contract with the brand is not the result of the growing allegations related to Kim Sae-ron.
LG Household & Health Care, a Korean retailer of beauty and household items, has set advertisement videos featuring Kim Soo-hyun to private on its YouTube channel. Kim was the model for the company’s ""Beyond"" beauty brand from 2012 to 2015.
Meanwhile, audiences of the shows on which Kim is currently appearing are demanding his removal.
On the viewer board for the MBC variety show ""Good Day,"" which features Kim Soo-hyun, posts are calling for his departure.
Some viewers have written comments such as, ""Please make him leave,"" ""I demand his departure"" and ""I signed up just to ask for his departure."" On the other hand, some viewers are defending him, commenting, ""I oppose his departure,"" and ""Let's stop this.""
""Good Day"" is an MBC variety show where K-pop star G-Dragon collaborates with various figures to complete the ""Song of the Year."" MBC said it is currently reviewing the requests to have the actor removed from the show.
Meanwhile, Disney+ is also anticipating the release of ""Knock Off,"" a series starring Kim Soo-hyun as the lead, in the first half of 2025. Amid the growing controversies, Disney+ has stated it has no updates to share at this time.
Seo Ye-ji, who was rumored to have dated Kim Soo-hyun in 2020, revealed that she is struggling with malicious comments.
On Thursday, Seo Ye-ji posted on her fan cafe, ""I am human, so I feel overwhelmed, exhausted, tired, sad and suffocated. I keep enduring, over and over.""
She shared a screenshot of a comment on the post. The comment in the photo accuses Seo of ""cheating"" if Kim indeed had been dating Kim Sae-ron for six years.

'clearly false and baseless'
""Queen of Tears"" star Kim Soo-hyun denided recent allegations linking him romantically to the late actress Kim Sae-ron.
On Monday, Gold Medalist, Kim Soo-hyun's agency, strongly refuted claims made by YouTube channel HoverLab Inc. (Garosero Yeonguso in Korean). The far-right Youtube Channel earlier that day published a video featuring alleged testimony from Kim Sae-ron's family, claiming the actors had carried on a six-year relationship beginning when she was 15 and he was 27.
The accusations immediately sparked heated reactions across social media platforms worldwide. Many users came down hard on the 37-year-old actor, with comments pointing to inappropriate conduct with a minor.
In a statement, the agency called the allegations ""clearly false and baseless"" and vowed to pursue ""the strongest possible legal actions"" against the YouTube channel for ""spreading falsehoods.""
HoverLab claimed to have verifed the allegations with Kim Sae-ron's parents and shared unfiltered audio from an interview with a relative. The actress took her own life last month at age 24.
The YouTube broadcast brought up additional claims about Kim's financial matters. According to allegations in the video, Gold Medalist, which represented Kim Sae-ron from 2019 to 2022 and was co-founded by Kim Soo-hyun's relative, initially picked up the tab for a 700 million won compensation related to the actress's 2022 drunk driving incident but later went after repayment through legal action.
On Tuesday, the channel revealed what it claimed was a desperate text message from Kim Sae-ron to Kim Soo-hyun pleading for more time to repay the debt, which allegedly went unanswered. The channel also hinted that more accusations would follow in upcoming videos.
Following HoverLab's second video, the agency on Wednesday stood firm in its denial of all allegations.
HoverLab has a checkered history of publishing content later ruled false or defamatory by courts. The channel, which started out as far-right political commentary, has lost a number of legal battles over its broadcasting practices in recent years.
In January, South Korea's Supreme Court ordered the channel to shell out 45 million won ($31,000) in damages to former Justice Minister Cho Kuk and his family.
Making a debut as an infant model in 2001, Kim Sae-ron began her acting career at the age of 9 with ""A Brand New Life"" (2009), which was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. She earned acclaim for her performances in ""The Man From Nowhere"" (2010) and ""A Girl at My Door"" (2014). Her television work included the period fantasy ""Mirror of the Witch"" (2016).
Kim's career took a hit in May 2022 after a drunk driving incident in Gangnam, southern Seoul. She crashed her car into a guardrail and transformer, cutting off electricity to dozens of businesses. Following public backlash, she withdrew from drama series ""Trolley"" and had most of her scenes edited out of Netflix's ""Bloodhounds.""
After the incident, Kim largely retreated from public life, though local media reported she had been attempting to return to acting through small-budget projects and stage plays. Her then agency Gold Medalist did not renew her contract following the incident.
The actress drew fresh attention in March 2024 when she briefly posted a photo with Kim Soo-hyun on social media before quickly taking it down. At that time, Kim Soo-hyun's representatives brushed off dating speculation as ""entirely without factual basis.""

Each episode offers a distinct mood, combining entertainment with purpose,” she added.
""Low Life,"" featuring Ryu Seung-ryong and Lim Soo-jung, delves into the tale of men vying to recover a newly unearthed treasure. The series has drawn attention under the direction of Kang Yoon-sung, renowned for his work on acclaimed projects like ""Roundup"" and Disney+ original ""Casino.""

Kang highlighted the “living, breathing characters” as the heart of the series. “Our drama features a diverse cast of characters with unique stories. They assert themselves and move as if they’re alive. The actors worked hard to interpret and bring these roles to life, and I made sure not to overlook any of their efforts,” Kang said.
In ""Hyper Knife,"" Park Eun-bin, acclaimed for her role in ""Extraordinary Attorney Woo,"" takes on the role of a rogue neurosurgeon performing illegal surgeries.

The series features a magical romance between Do Min-joon (Kim Soo-hyun), an alien pretending to be a human for hundreds of years after accidentally falling on Earth, and Chun Song-yi (Jun Ji-hyun, also known as Gianna Jun), a top actress who is spirited yet lonely. With its touching romance and well-timed comic scenes, the series garnered die-hard fans beyond Korea, reaching China, Japan, and many other countries. The drama, after its conclusion, was broadcast on the Japanese pay channel DATV, while in China, the Korean foods featured in the show gained huge popularity. Beside the storyline and the acting, the soundtrack was a key part of the series' charm. Every episode featured songs performed by cherished singers across generations, including tracks sung by the male lead, Kim Soo-hyun, himself. Sung Si-kyung, whose unforgettable timbre has made him one of Korea's most beloved ballad singers, composed and sang “Every Moment of You” for the soundtrack. With Sung’s soothing voice and heartwarming melody, the song remains popular even to this day. The lyrics, written by hitmaker Shim Hyun-bo, depict how Do Min-joon fell in love with Chun Song-yi: “And then, the moment I recognized you at a glance / Everything was clearly changing / My world divides into before and after knowing you” The song continues: “I hope I was present in every moment of yours / Just thinking about it makes my heart swell, I'm filled with you” Former Sistar member Hyolyn took part in the soundtrack as well. Although she is known for her powerful voice, she showcased a more tender and tearful voice in ""Good Bye."" The song begins gently, whistling the melody, gradually building up to a climax. The simple, repetitive melody captures the protagonists' fear of an impending separation against their will: “Love has come, but you say you're leaving, I've been waiting, but now I can't see you anymore.” ""My Love from the Star"" features the iconic track ""My Destiny"" by singer Lyn. Even after the drama ended, the song continued to be performed at award ceremonies and at special year-end stages. Lyn won the best soundtrack award for this song at the 50th Baeksang Arts Awards in 2014, a category that was newly established that year. Heartfelt declaration of love, delivered with Lyn’s deep voice, portrays the unbreakable bond between the two main characters despite ongoing trials – even transcending species: “You're the one my love, You are / You're my delight of all / You’re my everlasting love.” The lead actor Kim Soo-hyun sang two songs for the series, ""Promise"" and ""In Front of Your House."" Both songs are arranged to focus on Kim's voice. Especially notable is ""Promise,"" a remake of Lim Byeong-soo's 1984 song. Reinterpreted with acoustic guitar and Kim's gentle voice, the song reflects the situation of the two characters facing separation in episode 19: “On this night when the stars shine unusually bright / It makes me sad that you’re saying you’ll leave after this moment.”",kimsoohyun,5.0,"The article specifically mentions Kim Soo-hyun (김수현) multiple times, highlighting his role as the male lead in ""My Love from the Star"" and his contributions as a singer to the drama's soundtrack.

""Queen of Tears,"" a love story about an estranged couple who once deeply cared for each other, set a new record as the most-watched tvN drama series of all time, with the show's final episode recording a local viewership rating of 24.9 percent. Baek Hyun-woo (Kim Soo-hyun), who grew up in an ordinary household in the countryside, fell in love with Hong Hae-in (Kim Ji-won), the daughter of the owner of top conglomerate Queens Group. Amid Hae-in's battle with untreatable brain tumors and a conspiracy targeting Queens Group, they rekindle their love for one another. Although the series contained several K-drama cliches, including a love story involving a conglomerate and terminal illness, it managed to maintain a sense of novelty with well-timed twists and humor. And, while the latter part of the series may have faced some criticism due to unrealistic plot developments, its soundtrack and high-caliber acting performances still enchanted viewers, transporting them into the story. Crush's ""Love You With All My Heart"" delicately encapsulates the emotional journey of the two protagonists as they navigate misunderstandings and feelings of resentment, ultimately rediscovering their love for each other. The warm, lyrical melody suits Crush's gentle vocals, and the lyrics imply that the two protagonists had always longed for each other, despite having drifted apart: ""Still want you all the time/ I am still waiting for you/ Filling a room in the corner of my heart with longing."" Upon hearing the news of her illness, Hae-in goes to the place she and Hyun-woo visited during their honeymoon. Hyun-woo appears before her, and the two embrace, sincerely expressing their feelings for each other. Tears stream down their faces with the fear of losing each other, accompanied by the lyrics: ""Feelings that I have forgotten and my belated sincerity/ I'm sorry for being so late.” The song ""Fallin’,"" performed by Hong Isaac, winner of the third season of JTBC's “Sing Again,” is poignant, contributing to the story with its dramatic melody. Hong's solemn voice, combined with the strings and escalating chorus, creates the perfect ambiance. ""Fallin’"" was used in a key scene in episode 14, where Hyun-woo smashes the window of a burning car with his bare hands, mistakenly thinking Hae-in had been in an accident. As Hyun-woo sheds tears and tells Hae-in that he was so afraid thinking he had lost her, Hae-in embraces him and promises to survive for him. Here, the lyrics of the soundtrack resonate strongly with the audience: ""Without you, I am nothing/ I won't save any days left without expressing my heart/ I will give them all to you."" Kim Soo-hyun immerses viewers in the story through his outstanding performance in the lead role, as well as his voice. ""Way Home"" brings the series to a beautiful end, complementing the story of the two protagonists whose love survives through all odds. Featuring the acoustic guitar and the actor’s gentle voice, it is the first song on such a soundtrack performed by Kim Soo-hyun since 2013 hit series ""My Love From the Star."" As Hyun-woo and Hae-in smile and hold hands in a vast lavender field, the song's lyrics flawlessly express, ""The only miracle in my life was the time we shared.""

Aired in 2020, tvN TV series ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" depicts the story of lonely characters who pretend to be average adults despite their vulnerabilities. Ko Moon-young (Seo Ye-ji) is a children’s book writer whose mother -- also a writer --treated her as nothing more than a piece of art. While Moon-young's books are for children, they contain brutally honest emotions. Moon Gang-tae (Kim Soo-hyun), a caregiver at a psychiatric ward, is someone who has devoted his whole life to taking care of his autistic older brother. Moon-young and Gang-tae confront their trauma and wounds deep inside their hearts. The fairy tale is one of the main keywords of this drama. Not only because the female protagonist is a fairy tale writer, but it is her stories where the characters discover their wounds and later get healed. ""My Tale"" is the drama's original soundtrack, sung by Park Won. This song plays the gentle piano melody and the singer's warm voice comforts characters as they explore their hurtful childhood. Through Moon-young's book, ""Zombie Child,"" she implies she truly needed sincere love from their parents. Her mother never loved her back and her father even tried to kill her. Gang-tae also yearned for his mother’s love as she was always preoccupied herself with taking care of her eldest son with autism. Gang-tae sheds tears as he reads Moon-young’s book, recalling his lonely childhood and realizing that he and Moon-young may share the same sorrow. The lyrics show how Gang-tae begins to understand Moon-young: ""The closer I place you and the closer I look at you, we are alike. I know you too well, so I dare not get closer to you. I just watch you from this distance."" As the song progresses, the dramatic string sounds express Gang-tae's love getting intense: ""I want to read you again and again even though I read you every night, my tale."" AKMU vocalist Lee Su-hyun's ""In Your Time,"" another original soundtrack song from the drama, also tells the story of the two lonely children. With a gentle and tranquil piano melody, combined with Lee's crystal-clear voice, the song adorns several scenes with fairy-tale-like mise-en-scene. ""In Your Time"" is played in the fifth episode, when Gang-tae revisits Moon-young's home, which he visited as a child. As the two protagonists, once children, become adults, this episode depicts the years-long bond between them and their still somewhat unresolved wounds. ""I meet you again and find the one I once erased. After those painful days, I hold onto you. I am still living in your time,"" the lyrics go on as two imperfect adults face each other. This song is played again when their tragic past comes to light: Moon-young locks herself in the room after figuring out that her mother is related to a murder case involving Gang-tae's mother. In the finale, the two leave on a trip for the first time in their lives, along with Gang-tae's brother Sang-tae, who also makes his personal growth. The song ""Little by Little"" by singer-songwriter Cheeze plays as the characters find their peace and happiness. As Moon-young, a woman with a defensive attitude, and Gang-tae, who has lived his whole life only caring for his brother, smile at each other with sparkling eyes, the song goes on to say: ""At the end of my dark times I met you, I'm truly thankful because it was you.""

However, this notion is rapidly becoming a thing of the past, as local TV channels like SBS, MBC and KBS now compete with a slew of streaming platforms and changed viewing habits. Weekly television program schedules, typically filled with multiple drama series up until a number of years ago, is now filled with reality shows and pilot programs. Among local braodcasters, SBS has arguably seen the biggest shift in its programming. In the early 2010s, SBS built up a reputation as a ""drama kingdom"" with a slew of megahit original series including “That Winter, The Wind Blows,” “Your Voice,” “Master’s Sun,” “The Heirs” and “My Love from the Star” -- many of them recording more than 20 percent average viewership ratings. Rising stars Kim Woo-bin and Kim Ji-won gained massive popularity with “The Heirs"" in Korea and beyond. In addition, the 21-part romantic comedy “My Love from the Star,” starring top actors Gianna Jun and Kim Soo-hyun, saw major international success in China and the US. Remakes of the show also enjoyed huge popularity. In 2019, the broadcaster released a total of 15 drama series that aired six days a week -- four on Mondays and Tuesdays, five on Wednesdays and Thursdays and six on Fridays and Saturdays. Among them, “Hot Stove League,” “Nokdu Flower” and “The Last Empress” became local hits and brought multiple awards to the starring actors. However, SBS’ drama schedule changed drastically after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Wednesday-Thursday time slot for dramas was removed in 2020, and has not been reinstated since. Though the broadcaster continued to air Monday-Tuesday series with short breaks, SBS has not aired a drama series in the time slot since “The Secret Romantic Guesthouse,” which came to an end in May. The broadcaster announced that it would air an episode of its original 12-part suspense thriller series “The Killing Vote” once a week on Thursdays, adding that the decision was made to bring powerful stories and focus on creating high-quality content. The change was made in response to the fast-changing environment of the content industry. SBS currently airs only three new episodes of two drama series per week -- one for ""The Killing Vote"" on Thursdays, and two new episodes of another series on Fridays and Saturdays. Meanwhile, local broadcaster MBC followed a path similar to that taken by SBS. MBC, which had released five to six Wednesday-Thursday series since the early 2000s, cut down its number of TV dramas to three in 2021. With “On the Verge of Insanity,” which came to an end in August 2021, the broadcaster stopped servicing Wednesday-Thursday series. In 2020, MBC removed its Monday-Tuesday drama series time slot for the first time in 40 years, with the conclusion of the 16-part fantasy thriller “Kairos."" Currently, only Friday-Saturday dramas remain. However, the terrestrial broadcaster will air “A Good Day to Be a Dog” starting in October -- the first ever Wednesday drama in its 62-year history. While cable channels tvN and JTBC have released 17 and nine late-night series this year as of September, respectively, public broadcaster KBS has only aired five projects. “With many TV dramas’ viewership ratings plummeting to a single digit, broadcasters may experience budgetary pressures against offering as many drama series as they did several years ago,” an industry insider who wished to remain anonymous told The Korea Herald. Higher budgets, changing viewership patterns Others in the entertainment business explained that viewership ratings -- one of the crucial factors in raising advertising revenue, is not the only reason for the disappearance of dramas from local television channels. “The total number of dramas -- including those from both local broadcasters, cable channels and streaming services -- have increased from some 100 series in 2021 to almost 120 projects in 2022. This year, the Korean creative content business released more than 120 series,” the insider said. “More projects mean a wider range of options for top stars. This raises the amount paid to actors taking lead roles in these series,"" he added. In addition, the value of actors who usually play supporting roles has also risen over the past several years -- resulting in record-high budgets for drama projects. “However, if a megahit series is made, the broadcaster can expand the drama's intellectual property for possible foreign remakes or musical and film adaptations, among others. This is one of the many reasons why broadcasters cannot completely exclude large-budget contents from their TV lineups,” another insider said, sharing the broadcasters’ dilemma. Culture critic Jeong Deok-hyun said that local broadcasters are struggling because they are having difficulties in analyzing the fast-changing environment of the drama content business. “Many local TV dramas are planned and produced to a target audience of almost all age groups. However, local consumers' viewing habits have changed greatly,” the critic said. He said viewers have now moved to platforms which offer content that suit their tastes. A drama series that aims to satisfy viewers of all ages may not be strong enough to survive the fierce competition in the current market. Jeong added that many local broadcasters have decided to showcase more trot-themed TV shows to hold on to existing, older TV viewers. Trot is the longest-running pop genre in Korean music history. “Trot-themed programs can be seen as a survival strategy for TV channels to retain older viewers. Such tactic can be a way to maintain the status quo, but I don’t think it is a future-oriented solution,” Jeong said.",kimsoohyun,3.0,"The article mentions Kim Soo-hyun in the context of his role in the internationally successful drama ""My Love from the Star,"" which aligns with his work as an actor.

Musical ""Dream High"" is based on the TV series and used some songs from the original soundtrack, but the story shows the story of the main characters 10 years later. Song Sam-song (played by Kim in the TV series) returns to Kiran Arts High School to find his teacher after his career as a K-pop star ends due to buzzing in his ears. ""While Song Sam-dong may appear successful, he is filled with inner fears. I wanted to convey the message to the audience, 'Life may be unstable, but it is going well.'"" The musical version focuses on dance performances. “We have seen many musicals that work through songs. However, in our work, we are striving to find resolutions for the fears and desires of the characters in our story through primal gestures, which are even more fundamental than singing,” director Lee Jong-seok told reporters on Thursday.

Starring big-name stars Kim Soo-hyun and Cha Seung-won, ""One Ordinary Day,"" an original by local stream service Coupang Play, is based on BBC's popular crime drama ""Criminal Justice."" The eight-part series delves into the criminal justice system through the story of two men connected to woman's murder. Since its premier on Nov. 27, it has received rave reviews at home and abroad, playing a role in helping the latecoming streamer become the fifth biggest player in the Netflix-led market. Cable channel TV Chosun's ""Uncle"" is a TV adaptation of the British sitcom of the same name, first broadcast in December last year. The comedy is about an uncle who struggles to protect his nephew after his sister's divorce. The Korean show's viewership rose to 9.3 percent for its 14th episode and received critical acclaim for its well-rounded storytelling of social and educational discrimination and domestic violence. Netflix, which has been enjoying boom times in the country for a series of megahits, including ""Squid Game"" and ""All of Us Are Dead,"" will come up with a Korean edition of ""Money Heist,"" a hit Netflix original made in Spain, later this year. Starring ""Squid Game"" star Park Hae-soo, ""Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area"" will feature a group of a genius and thieves who team up to carry out a heist on the Korean Peninsula. The Korean version of the British drama series ""Cleaning Up"" is also up for broadcast in the coming months on local cable channel JTBC. It revolves around three female cleaners at financial companies who are accidentally involved in insider trading. Studio Dragon, a leading TV series production company under the wing of CJ ENM, has confirmed that it will adapt the French comedy ""Call My Agent!"" into Korean, while the American romantic comedy ""Jane the Virgin"" will be also remade into a Korean TV series. Experts said Korean productions are making various efforts to meet rising demand from viewers around the world through borderless platforms.

In the summer, when the country was struggling with a resurgence in novel coronavirus infections, TV studios and broadcasters halted productions of dramas and shows. Entertainment giant CJ ENM and its drama production affiliate Studio Dragon suspended drama filming for a week in August, with several shows on tvN and OCN affected by the stoppage. Other networks, including KBS and SBS, followed them. Subsequent temporary suspensions and delays stemming from tightened social distancing have slowed down scheduled productions for this year and struck a blow to the industry as a whole. As a result, public broadcasters, like KBS and MBC, which do not have their own studios, are projected to come up with fewer than 10 dramas for next year. In 2019, an average 12 dramas were aired on 10 South Korean TV channels, according to industry data. Only a few series on the 2020 lineup are under spotlight, including tvN's ""Jirisan,"" starring Jun Ji-hyun, and ""Vincenzo,"" starring Song Joong-ki, and Netflix's ""Kingdom: Ashin of the North."" ""Due partly to the lingering virus pandemic, it's become too hard and expensive to produce a TV drama,"" culture critic Kim Heon-shik said. ""But the unprecedented coronavirus epidemic is not the only reason that the TV channels have been reducing drama productions."" A paradigm shift to online multi-channel platforms, such as YouTube or Netflix, is also behind the trend, he added. An increasing number of young people do not watch TV and prefer short-form web-based series available anywhere and anytime on their smartphones. ""Expensive TV series starring big-name stars no longer guarantee higher viewership ratings,"" the expert said. ""Those stars also turn their eyes to other platforms that provide the content to more than 100 countries."" Star-studded blockbuster dramas failed to catch the eyes of viewers this year, putting financially-troubled broadcasters into a corner. The romance, ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"" logged an audience share in the 4-6 percent range throughout its 16-episode run. It was a disappointing number considering that the series was highly anticipated as star actor Kim Soo-hyun's first appearance on the small screen in about five years.

The broadcast censorship body on Wednesday held a subcommittee and decided to issue a legal sanction to the television series for several breaches against the broadcast deliberation regulations, including Article 27 on duties of integrity and Article 30 on gender equality. “Even considering the fact that they were meant to exaggeratedly express a character’s personality, (the scenes in question) show how insensitive the drama’s producers are to gender equality in broadcasting content that may belittle a certain gender and hold the possibility to justify sexual harassment and molestation,” the subcommission said, adding the use of excessive abusive language in the series also contributed to the decision. In the third episode of the series that aired June 27, female lead Mun-young, a figure with a personality disorder, overtly stares and touches male lead Gang-tae’s body as he gets dressed. The drama series was also slammed by internet users for scenes where another male character, who suffers from manic depression and exhibitionism, reveals parts of his bare body, with his genitals covered by a drawing of an elephant. A “warning” as a legal sanction is considered a heavy penalty here, as it affects the broadcaster unfavorably during the KCSC’s annual broadcast evaluation for license renewal.

In the currently airing tvN drama “It’s Okay to Not Be Okay,” starring Seo Ye-ji and Kim Soo-hyun, Volvo’s premium sports utility vehicle XC90 and S90, a mid-sized luxury sedan, are heavily featured, gliding along the coastal roads of Goseong, Gangwon Province. The Volvo cars have also stood out on other TV programs, with popular celebrities takingthe cars for a ride, such as SSak 3, a trio of entertainer Yoo Jae-suk, singers Lee Hyo-ri and Rain, which was formed on MBC’s entertainment program “Hangout With You.” Volvo Korea said it started putting efforts into TV tie-in after it witnessed the power of the marketing method when its XC90 appeared in JTBC reality show “Hyori’s Bed & Breakfast” and went viral in 2017. “We previously made decisions to work with celebrities who already owned Volvo cars. We also look for actors and television personalities who match with the brand’s image,” a Volvo Korea official told The Korea Herald. Lee’s husband singer-songwriter Lee Sang-soon had already owned Volvo’s V60, a five-door wagon, and the company decided to lend the XC90 to the couple -- which they ended up buying after the show ended. While the increased exposure of its products on TV appears to have had positive effects on overall sales, it has also attracted younger customers, according to the company.

The romance thriller ""The World of the Married,"" the South Korean adaptation of BBC's ""Doctor Foster,"" was the biggest hit TV series during the period, with its viewership reaching as high as 28.4 percent. It is the highest-ever rating by a drama on a non-terrestrial TV channel. The 16-episode drama, which features the revenge of a dedicated wife, played by Kim Hee-ae, coupled with intense suspense and unpredictable storytelling, also won director Mo Wan-il the best TV director award at this year's Baeksang Arts Awards. JTBC's ""Itaewon Class,"" starring star actor Park Seo-joon, was the No. 2 drama of the first half with viewership of 16.5 percent, the seventh-highest viewership rating in cable television history. In a bid to maintain the competitive edge in the second half of the year, the broadcaster has launched the mystery ""Graceful Friend,"" portraying close friends who face a murder in their town, and the crime drama ""The Good Detective,"" a battle between detectives who reveal the truth and cover it up. On the other hand, tvN, a cable channel run by entertainment giant CJ ENM, suffered a worse-than-expected first-half performance, except for the romantic comedy ""Crash Landing On You,"" which started its 16-episode run in December last year. Its prime-time series including the romantic comedy ""Oh My Baby,"" starring Jang Na-ra, and the romance drama ""It's OK to Not Be OK,"" starring Kim Soo-hyun, failed to impress South Korean viewers. ""Oh My Baby,"" about a workaholic single woman, recorded 2.9 percent in viewership rating at best and quietly finished its 16th episode on July 2.

During the show’s fifth episode that aired Friday, a man who introduces himself as Nigerian encounters a Korean man with a similar dreadlocked hairstyle to his own in a convenience store and the two suddenly embrace each other as they “belong to the same Jamaican family.” Singing incomprehensible melodies, the two dance together to instrumental music. The scene sparked a outrage from the drama’s foreign viewers. Comments on social media included, “Tell me why this is on a popular K-drama in this day and age. As much as I love Ji Chang-wook, this drama has got to go” and “This is so stereotyping. They really think every African person is the same. I’m so disgusted by the fact this drama is made in 2020.” The SBS drama, starring Kim You-jung and Ji Chang-wook, was in hot water even before its first episode aired because the web comic series it is based on had a lot of sexually suggestive scenes. The web comic of the same title contained sexual objectification of an underage female, as the story depicts a romance between an underage employee and a grown-up male manager of a convenience store. In response to outcries of concern, the series’ director Lee Myung-woo explained that the series is a show that the whole family can watch together, “Only taking the positive energy of the two lead characters in the original comic.” As the show hit the air, however, the series instantly received criticism from viewers due to several scenes, including one showing a high-school girl flirting with a grown-up man and kissing him on the lips and another portraying prostitution -- not depicted in the original web comic -- which is prohibited by law in Korea. A few days after the first episode aired, more than 6,000 complaints were made on the webpage of the Korea Communication Standards Commission, some even calling for the show to be halted, while others took it to the broadcaster’s website and social media to lash out at the drama’s controversial scenes. According to the explanation made by an official from the KCSC on Wednesday, a subcommittee is expected to deliberate the episodes in relation to Article 27 (duties of integrity) and Article 51 (use of broadcasting language) of the body’s review regulation. “It seems the producer believed he could sublimate such problematic elements of the original web comic -- whether it be the sexual or the discriminatory aspects -- through exaggerated black comedy, which was also shown in the producer’s previous series ‘The Fiery Priest,’” TV drama critic Yun Suk-jin told The Korea Herald. “The thought that he could adapt the original content to drama overlooking such elements was a mistake.” Meanwhile, post-military comeback piece for heartthrob Kim Soo-hyun, tvN’s “It’s Okay to Not Be Okay” also received over 50 complaints on KCSC website regarding its scenes depicting sexual harassment.　 In the show’s third episode, which aired on June 27, the lead female character Mun-young, played by Seo Ye-ji, makes her way into the men’s dressing room and gazes overtly at Gang-tae, played by Kim, as he gets changed, touching his bare body against his will and making sexually offensive remarks to him. Mun-young, who is depicted as having a personality disorder, continues to make judgmental comments about Gang-tae’s appearance, calling him “pretty,” and treating him like her possession. The KCSC official added the deliberation on “It’s Okay to Not Be Okay” has not been decided yet. Yun, also a professor of Korean literature at Chungnam University, explained the discordance between the TV producers and the younger viewers in their sensitivity to gender issues may be the fundamental reason behind the continuing controversies. “The expression ‘gender-sensitivity’ itself is unfamiliar to many in our society, and although ideas about gender equality have been evolving fast recently, this is not portrayed in television drama productions. These idle attitudes (toward gender) held by producers, pushed by their battle for viewership ratings, ends up to the creation of such inappropriate scenes.” By Choi Ji-won ()",kimsoohyun,3.0,"The article briefly mentions Kim Soo-hyun in the context of his drama ""It’s Okay to Not Be Okay"" and its controversial scenes, which relates to his work as an actor.

But their new dramas were performing far below expectations, and even the stars with large followings abroad were unable to give them a badly needed boost. Lee Min-ho, who soared to stardom with the 2009 drama series ""Boys Over Flowers,"" starred in the fantasy romance ""The King: Eternal Monarch"" on SBS this spring. It was the first TV project after completing his two-year military duty in April last year. He took the title role of Lee Gon, emperor of the Korean Empire in the past, who goes over to the present-day Republic of Korea after a time portal opens due to unknown reasons. But the show fizzled out despite its all-star cast of Lee and actress Kim Go-eun and star screenwriter Kim Eun-sook, who has created smash hit series, such as the fantasy ""Guardian: The Lonely and Great God"" (2016) and the periodical drama ""Mr. Sunshine"" (2018). Its viewership ratings have hovered around 7 percent, far lower than expected, since its first episode aired on April 17. Its final episode on June 12 reached 8.1 percent. Last week, star actor Kim Soo-hyun made a comeback to the entertainment scene in three years with tvN's weekend series ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay."" It is about a romance between a caretaker and a novelist. Kim, regarded as one of the biggest Korean Wave, or ""hallyu,"" stars with selling power across Asia, temporarily left show business to serve in the military after his last silver screen project, ""Real,"" was a box office flop in 2017.

The upcoming weekend series is the first television role for the 31-year-old since he was discharged from the military last July. His most recent TV credits include “The Producers” in 2015 and “My Love From the Star” in 2013. “I’ve been waiting for so long, I’m really nervous but also excited to come back,” Kim said Wednesday during a promotional media event. The event was livestreamed due to concerns over COVID-19. In the series about people living with mental illness, Kim plays Gang-tae, who works as a caretaker in the psychiatric ward of a hospital. Gang-tae, who also cares for his autistic brother at home, is reluctant to pursue any romantic relationships. Actress Seo Ye-ji plays Mun-young, a bestselling children’s book author who has a personality disorder. While Mun-young is apparently unable to love anyone, Gang-tae seems to be able to melt her cold heart as the two become a source of healing for each other. “(Mun-young) pursues a unique style. It’s not to show off herself but it’s like a defense mechanism. She’s telling people to not to approach her or talk to her,” Seo said. Actor Oh Jeong-sae, who recently won best supporting actor on television at the Baeksang Arts Awards for his role in the KBS drama “When the Camellia Blooms,” stars as Gang-tae’s older brother Sang-tae. Rookie actress Park Gyu-young stars as a nurse who falls for Gang-tae. “I think the title says it all. I feel everyone, including myself, in this world is a little bit mad in some ways and I wanted to take the chance to think about whether this is actually bad or not,” the series’ director, Park Sin-woo, said. Park previously produced the 2018 series “Encounter,” featuring Song Hye-kyo and Park Bo-gum, and SBS’ “Don’t Dare to Dream,” starring Gong Hyo-jin and Cho Jung-seok. Quoting screenwriter Jo Yong, Park said the drama was “an apology to people with disabilities.” “We often judge other people and hurt them, and the writer says she wrote the script based on her own experiences, wanting to face those people properly,” the director said. “I hope that, after watching the 16 episodes, people will want to befriend disabled people rather than trying to help them,” Oh said. “I wanted to show how Gang-tae is healed of his inner wounds,” Kim said. “There are many different stories and forms of love in the drama, and I hope the viewers can also heal their own wounds following them,” Kim said.

K-pop juggernaut S.M. Entertainment has ramped up efforts to equip itself with TV series production capacities and stronger actor and actress lineups in response to a growing demand for South Korean TV content in the global market. On Wednesday, the firm confirmed two planned acquisition deals worth a combined 80 billion won ($74.9 million). Along with anticipation for improvement in the relationship between Korea and China, the deals will extend the Kosdaq-listed firm’s growth that it has sustained for a year, analysts noted. On Friday, S.M. Entertainment’s share price came to 42,800 won at the market’s close, up 2.4 percent from Thursday’s close. A day prior, S.M. Entertainment recorded a 52-week high of 47,050 won. The firm recorded a 52-week low a year ago on March 21, 2017, at 22,150 won. The firm became the 45th-largest firm on the second-tier market and the biggest among all listed entertainment firms, with 931.1 billion won in market cap. Foreign investors held 20.3 percent of stocks trading on the market as of Friday. S.M. Entertainment is a talent management agency that houses K-pop groups such as EXO, Red Velvet, NCT, f(x) and Girls’ Generation. Veteran boy bands like TVXQ and Super Junior are gearing up for new releases after their members ended their military service late last year. The K-pop powerhouse’s announcement on Wednesday heralded its expansion into the TV content business, as it is set to become major shareholders of agencies that produce TV series. According to regulatory filings, S.M. Entertainment in May will not only own 25.1 percent of Keyeast shares at the cost of 50 billion won, but also 30.5 percent of shares in FNC Add Culture worth 30 billion won. Bae Yong-joon, an actor-turned-entrepreneur who holds 25.12 percent of Keyeast shares, will sell all his Keyeast shares to S.M. Entertainment, which would make the company the largest shareholder of Keyeast. Bae, who rose to stardom with his lead role in “Winter Sonata” will in return be given 920,000 newly issued shares of S.M. Entertainment worth some 35 billion won. S.M. Entertainment will also buy Keyeast shares worth 15 billion won and FNC Add Culture shares worth 20 billion won. Both Keyeast and FNC Add Culture are listed on the Kosdaq. Another 10 billion won of FNC Add Culture, one of the key subsidiaries of FNC Entertainment, will be raised through a recapitalization. Through the deals, S.M. Entertainment would become the largest shareholders of Keyeast and FNC Add Culture, in addition to SM Culture & Contents, in which S.M. Entertainment currently owns 38.21 percent of shares. The three content producers aired a total of five TV series in 2017. Analysts projected that S.M. Entertainment would emerge as a mainstream TV series producer, along with powerhouses in the TV production industry Studio Dragon and Jcontentree. Jay Park, an analyst at Mirae Asset Daewoo, wrote in a note that S.M. Entertainment’s deals would “increase TV content’s market presence,” as subsidiaries under the entertainment giant will interoperate, maximizing “synergy effects.” “Management agencies and content production agencies (under S.M. Entertainment) have mutual benefits within the content value chain,” wrote Park. While pinning hopes on S.M. Entertainment’s momentum driven by new business opportunities, Park wrote that the content production arms are “unlikely to make immediate profits,” citing their disadvantage against rivals like Studio Dragon and Jcontentree when it comes to TV channels that air its series, intellectual property issues and creator know-how, among other factors. If a thaw in the relationship between Korea and China materializes, momentum will be achieved sooner than expected, he added. Another analyst, Kwon Yoon-goo from DB Financial Investment, wrote that the acquisition deals would push S.M. Entertainment to become a top-tier actors’ agency, with the addition of 41 actors and actresses including Park Seo-joon, Ju Ji-hoon and Ahn So-hee, as well as Kim Soo-hyun who is now serving his military service. Meanwhile, the stock price did not instantly respond to the news of stock purchases. On Wednesday, S.M. Entertainment shed 2.4 percent from the previous trading day, while Keyeast dipped 6.1 percent. The prices of both shares on Thursday sharply jumped early in the morning, but the gains evaporated later in the morning. Meanwhile, the Financial Supervisory Service has begun a probe into allegations of insider trading of shares of S.M. Entertainment, Keyeast and FNC Add Culture. Immediately before the announcement, Keyeast surged over 20 percent on Tuesday alone, while S.M. Entertainment and FNC Add Culture jumped 18.5 percent and 15 percent, respectively, for three trading days until Tuesday.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1543920,Best Korean movies of 2017,2017-12-26,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2017/12/26/20171226000968_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Another year has come to a wrap in the Korean film industry. Genres continue to be limited to political thrillers and crime flicks, and the scarcity of female roles persists. Despite the relative lack of diversity, however, 2017 turned out to be a year that offered several pleasant, unexpected surprises for moviegoers. Quieter, more pensive films excelled this year, offering insight into humanity and the everyday.  Okja  Adventure, fantasy   Directed by Bong Joon-ho   Distributed by Netflix, Next Entertainment World “Okja” is a film full of heart, an optimistic story that also peers into some of the most twisted aspects of a social order mankind has created for themselves. 　 Vegetarians and environmentalists hailed the film as an effective campaign tool against the mass-production of meat, and though it makes an excellent case, the film is much more than an advocate for green eating. It speaks of universal issues such as the need for empathy, the inevitable pang of growing up and facing a vicious world, the inhumane order of capitalism and the terrible consequences that one person’s envy can cause. 　 At once a coming-of-age tale, satire and good old-fashioned adventure ride, led by the indefatigable young heroine Mija (Ahn Seo-hyun), “Okja” once again proves director Bong’s unique sensitivity and intellect. It includes picturesque Korean landscapes, large-scale yet detailed chase scenes, a richly layered story and an equally diverse cast.  The Fortress  Historical drama  Directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk   Distributed by CJ Entertainment    In Korea, dozens of period pieces are made every year for both film and television, but “The Fortress” is that rare example of a historical drama that appreciates history in all its complexity. 　 It also invites viewers to ponder philosophical issues through characters who seem to adhere to a higher moral standard than the modern bureaucrat. The year is 1636. The location, Namhansanseong, a mountain fortress southeast of Seoul. Joseon’s King Injo (Park Hae-il), his advisers and people are trapped within its walls in the freezing winter, unable to escape from or fight against a Chinese invasion. 　 At the center of the film lies the ideological struggle that ensues as the king’s two highest advisors -- Choi Myung-gil (Lee Byung-hun) and Kim Sang-hun (Kim Yoon-seok) -- fiercely debate on the course of action to take. Choi opts to surrender, arguing that life and survival precede lofty ideals, while Kim, staunchly believing that the only meaningful life is one with honor and dignity, argues Joseon should fight even if it means death. 　 The film’s debate mirrors the philosophical tension that was pervasive throughout the Joseon era; some scholars today argue that it was Joseon’s excessive emphasis on form and formality that led to its demise. In the film, both arguments, meanwhile, pale when compared to the brutal reality of people dying from frostbite and starvation.  The Running Actress  Drama, comedy  Directed by Moon So-ri   Distributed by Metaplay Humorous, intelligent and reflective, this is a gem of a film and the directorial feature debut of acclaimed actress Moon So-ri, known for films such as “Oasis.” Moon, who penned, directed and starred in the film, tells a semi-autobiographical three-part story about the daily life of an actress, which usually begins and ends in a breakdown in her van. 　 Moon struggles with the gap between the cachet people place on actresses -- “You must not eat (cheap) food like this!” -- and the painfully menial, often demeaning, details of her actual daily routine. With a livelihood that relies so heavily on “personal charm” and “beauty,” the actress perennially wavers between confidence in her skills, the courage to ask for better roles and intense insecurity. The film ends with a stirring contemplation on art and life.  The First Lap  Drama  Directed by Kim Dae-hwan   Distributed by Indieplug    With his sophomore feature, Kim Dae-hwan proves once again that he has a keen eye for capturing the real Korean family. His debut work “End of Winter” observed how deep-seated resentments begin manifesting themselves after a family is snowed in in their hometown. 　 “The First Lap” focuses on a young couple as they attempt to navigate adult life, meet each other’s families and evade, for as long as possible, that daunting institution of marriage for fear of turning out like their respective parents. In two achingly naturalistic performances that were in large part adlibbed, according to director Kim, Jo Hyun-chul and Kim Sae-byuk bring to life a thoroughly average millennial Korean couple and all their blunders.  The Merciless  Crime, action  Directed by Byun Sung-hyun  Distributed by CJ Entertainment Director Byun made an explosive debut with the stylish noir “The Merciless,” which was invited to Cannes Film Festival’s midnight screenings in May. 　 The value of this film lies in its style -- its bold, vintage colors, the meticulous arrangement of the buildings and people -- and how it follows the emotions of its two lead characters, the seemingly hardened gangster Han Jae-ho (Sol Kyung-gu) and reckless young delinquent Jo Hyun-soo (Im Si-wan). Their relationship evolves to become deeper than a bromance and more calculated than a romance. The film’s box office numbers, meanwhile, received a blow due to public outrage at director Byun’s sexual tweets about his actors, for which the director subsequently apologized. Distinctly ‘Korean’ films that soothed the souls of Koreans  “A Taxi Driver,” directed by Jang Hoon, became the 11th most-viewed Korean film of all time. Through the movie, we see that through the efforts of one taxi driver -- played by the always enjoyable Song Kang-ho -- and a relentless German journalist, Korea’s May 18 Democratic Uprising, where hundreds were killed while protesting the military government, became known to the world. “I Can Speak,” directed by Kim Hyeon-suk, also deals with Korea’s lingering pain from history. The elderly Na Ok-boon (Na Moon-hee) is a neighborhood busybody who pesters civil servant Park Min-jae (Lee Je-hoon) for English lessons. It turns out that Na was forced into military sexual slavery in her youth by the Japanese. By learning English, she exposes Japan’s crimes on the international stage. Spectacular computer graphics   Ryoo Seung-wan’s “The Battleship Island” recreated almost in its entirety Japan’s Hashima Island, where Korean people were forced into slave labor by the Japanese, both using a set and through computer graphics. The film shows large-scale explosions in the narrow underground coal mines, Korean laborers’ decrepit living conditions and a rebellion that breaks out among the workers. 　 Kim Yong-hwa’s “Along with the Gods: The Two Worlds” offered another example of sheer scale and spectacle. It created a vast fantasy world of the afterlife, from the burning hell of lava to sprawling deserts and towering waterfalls. The graphics were undertaken by Kim’s Dexter Studios, one of Asia’s leading motion picture production studios. Daring films that attempted to transcend genre   Director Lee Sa-rang’s “Real,” starring Kim Soo-hyun, caused a small sensation when it was released in June. With blaring electronic visuals (so much red lighting), a plot that attempted to intertwine the present, the past, the psyche, and reality, and explicit sex scenes, the film was incomprehensible and utterly new -- though perhaps not in the best way. It is worth noting for its courage to break all rules. Shin Su-won’s “Glass Garden” features a scientist (Moon Geun-young) who isolates herself in the forest to research blood. She discovers a way to create “green blood” by infusing blood with chloroplasts, and dreams of one day turning into a tree. The novelty of the premise led the film to open this year’s Busan International Film Festival.

Its pop songs, dramas and movies flooded into the once banned communist country, which has become the springboard for ""hallyu,"" or the growing popularity of South Korean popular culture. But they have recently emerged as a victim of politics. Korean showbiz faces the hardest time since entering China 25 years ago amid a raging anti-Korean sentiment and state restrictions sparked by ongoing diplomatic feuds over the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea. The two Cold War foes established diplomatic ties on Aug. 24, 1992, opening the way for cultural exchanges between the two countries. China had its first taste of Korean pop culture in 1993, when the South Korean drama ""Jealousy"" was bought and aired by China's state-run CCTV. Since then, over 100 Korean TV series were broadcast in China, mostly to positive reaction. Hallyu, or the Korean Wave, hit its stride in China through TV shows during the early-to-mid 2000s with hit series such as ""Autumn Tale"" (2000) and ""Daejanggeum"" (2005). But the presence of Korean television shows later waned in China after Beijing imposed a cap on foreign TV dramas aired in the country. It wasn't until ""The Heirs,"" starring Lee Min-ho and Park Shin-hye, was made available via the online streaming platform iQiyi in 2013, that hallyu entered a renaissance phase. Lee became one of the most sought-out celebrities, appearing on ""New Year's Gala,"" one of China's premier television events on CCTV. Demand for Korean TV shows soared with the airing of ""My Love from the Star,"" a time-travel alien fantasy series starring Kim Soo-hyun and Jun Ji-hyun, and later skyrocketed with last year's ""Descendants of the Sun,"" featuring Song Joong-ki and Song Hye-kyo. ""In my view, Korea has relatively more appealing and talented actors. Also the Korean production industry's tight screenplays and films seem to have attracted demand from Chinese viewers,"" said a South Korean producer who is currently working for a Chinese satellite TV network. Han Jae-hyuk, head of the Korean Cultural Center in China, pointed out how the term hallyu was first coined in China. ""Hallyu first emerged from China after H.O.T was showcased in the country in 2000. After establishing diplomatic relations, the two sides have had a wide range of exchanges, to the degree that there is almost no Chinese person who hasn't watched a Korean drama,"" said Han. But for the past year or so it's become impossible to see Korean TV shows in China. China virtually banned South Korean cultural and entertainment products in protest of Seoul's decision to set up a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery on its soil. Seoul says it is to better protect itself from the ever-rising military threats posed by North Korea, but Beijing believes the THAAD system can be used to monitor its own military activities, thereby hampering regional peace and stability. Partnerships and joint projects in areas such as TV shows, games and music between the two countries were abruptly suspended, seriously hurting South Korean companies that had made hefty financial commitments. SBS TV's ""Saimdang, Memoir of Colors,"" for example, was intended to be aired in South Korea and China simultaneously, but Beijing's broadcast regulator is still sitting on its approval. TV footage of Korean stars was edited out, and scheduled concerts and fan meet-and-greets for K-pop stars, such as EXO and BIGBANG, were banned without explanation. But the ban doesn't necessarily mean the Chinese aren't consuming Korean products. Piracy over the Internet has allowed unfettered access to even the most up-to-date Korean TV shows. News stories on ""Legend of the Blue Sea"" and ""Guardian: The Lonely and Great God"" have racked up billions of views on Chinese portals, suggesting that Korean shows are being widely pirated. In the past, most of the Chinese networks had paid for licenses to adopt South Korean programs, but intellectual property theft is becoming more common after the culture ban, with copycat shows of ""Three Meals a Day,"" ""Fantastic Duo"" and Youn's Kitchen"" having been introduced. On the music record front, K-pop is still going strong. G-Dragon of boy band BIGBANG sold 762,000 copies of his latest solo album ""Kwon Ji Yong"" in June on release day alone, while groups EXO and EXID are also among the top-tier artists on major music streaming charts. Experts say that in order to better appease China in general, creators must prioritize the quality of their content.

In 2014, “My Love From the Star,” featuring Kim Soo-hyun as a charming extraterrestrial and Jun Ji-hyun as a loveable actress, caused a sensation throughout Asia. In 2016, military romance “Descendants of the Sun,” starring Song Joong-ki and Song Hye-kyo, swept fans in the region off their feet. Earlier this year, “Guardian: The Lonely and Great God” propelled its lead Gong Yoo to global fame, despite a de facto ban in China on entertainment from Korea. The Korea Herald asked experts for their forecasts for the K-drama industry in the coming years. The consensus is that the scale of production will inevitably become larger and storylines more diverse. Family drama, romantic comedies here to stay  In terms of content, K-dramas originally rose to fame for their detailed descriptions of family life and ideal love stories. Though topics are becoming increasingly diverse, experts predict these staples will remain fixtures of K-drama in the years to come.　 “Even if family structures are changing these days, the fantasy that family dramas offer will not wane,” said culture critic Jung Deok-hyun. “It’s like how we thirst for the analog as we evolve deeper into the digital age.”　 The family dramas to come in the future will, however, have to accommodate the changes in the average Korean household, Jung added.　 Currently, TV dramas boasting the highest ratings in Korea continue to be weekend series aimed at middle-aged and elderly women, such as “My Father Is Strange” (27.9 percent) and “Band of Sisters” (17.6 percent), which focus on the dynamics of marriage and multigenerational households. 　 Outside of Korea, romantic comedies such as “The Heirs” (2013), featuring billionaire high schoolers’ entangled love lives, continue to draw in the bulk of younger viewers in their 20s and below.　 “Viewers are becoming more sophisticated,” said Park Hyun, CEO of global K-drama streaming site DramaFever. “The younger viewers who were with us nine years ago have now aged. They’re savvy about Korean culture and access information quickly.” 　 The streaming site, acquired by Warner Bros. last year, was the sole global platform to stream “Guardian: The Lonely and Great God.” 　 Though the show is darker than a typical romantic comedy, intricately mixing drama and fantasy, it drew in fans. 　 “It became our most-watched and re-watched Korean series,” Park said. Several recent K-dramas have been genre series, such as gripping investigative thrillers and time-traveling science-fiction. Thrillers such as “Signal,” “Tunnel” and most recently, “Stranger” have received rave reviews among viewers and critics alike. 　 “‘Stranger’ is the most outstanding result that inherits only the best of the Korean genre drama, which has undergone a long trial and error period,” drama critic and TV personality Heo Ji-woong wrote in a column this month, citing the history of past acclaimed genre dramas such as “Sign” (2011) and “Nine: Nine Time Travels” (2013). 　 Starring Bae Doo-na and Jo Seung-woo, “Stranger” tells a well-constructed story of an unfeeling prosecutor and passionate police investigator. Heo went on to comment that the subtle tonal balance the drama achieves is “almost like a performance.” “It is not predictable, but it also appeals to the general public.” 　 The show was the debut work of scriptwriter Lee Soo-yeon, spotlighted as a promising talent.　 The Korean brand of genre dramas is beginning to be recognized abroad as well. Scriptwriter Kim Eun-hee, who penned “Signal,” is writing a new drama series called “Kingdom,” to be produced by global streaming giant Netflix. Based on webtoon series “Land of the Gods,” “Kingdom” will combine a Joseon era setting and modern concept of zombies. The series is to be helmed by director Kim Sung-hoon (“Tunnel,” 2016).   From film to drama The boundaries between film and drama are increasingly becoming blurred in Korea, reflecting global trends. TvN series “Criminal Minds,” a remake of the American police procedural crime drama of the same name, kicked off last month with film director Yang Yoon-ho at the helm. 　 Other filmmakers such as Jang Hang-joon, Hwang Ji-seung and Kwak Kyung-taeg have also jumped into the TV landscape in the last several years.　 “There is a demand for more epic, film-like scenes in Korean dramas,” said Jung Tae-won, CEO of Taewon Entertainment and a producer of “Criminal Minds.” 　 In 2014, film distributor Next Entertainment World participated in the production of “Descendants of the Sun.” 　 “Overseas shooting know-how and making scenes on a larger, film-like scale created synergy,” a KBS official said. 　 As K-dramas evolve in both cinematography and audience reach, viewers are thirsting for greater spectacles and higher quality scenes, experts say. 　 By Rumy Doo ()",kimsoohyun,4.0,"The article specifically mentions Kim Soo-hyun in the context of his role in the 2014 drama ""My Love From the Star,"" which aligns with his work as an actor.

His last film was the 2013 “Secretly, Greatly.” The script of “Real” had made a deep imprint in his mind, Kim said. “I couldn’t get it out of my head. I couldn’t sleep. I said to myself, ‘a frightening script has come my way.’” In the film, Kim plays the dual role of casino gang boss Jang Tae-young who is suffering from a multiple personality disorder, and his alter ego, a freelance reporter. Kim gives vigorous performances as the dangerous drug-addicted mobster engaged in a turf war with a rival gang, his eerie doppelganger and a meek reporter investigating the effects of a powerful new drug. Lee Sung-min plays the ghoulish doctor who psychoanalyzes Jang. Former K-pop singer Sulli, credited with her real name Choi Jin-ri, makes her acting debut as Song Yoo-hwa, a physical therapy expert and Jang’s lover. The film is the directorial debut of Lee Sa-rang (Love Lee), who said he had wanted to create “a new type of story.” Lee is also Kim‘s cousin and the head of a film production company. “I wanted to go beyond our everyday feelings and logic. I thought that this type of movie should also exist.” The film boasts a futuristic setting complete with blazing red neon lights and towering cityscapes, matched with deep, reverberating electronic music and scenes that jumble memories and the subconscious. The alter egos that Kim plays are “wannabes” of each other, Lee said. 　 “They both want to be the real thing. But if you ask them what ‘real’ is, I don’t think either of them know. “When we talk about what is ‘real,’ if felt like faith. Belief that something is real. I didn’t want to pinpoint one correct answer and explain it to viewers.” Kim, meanwhile, has yet to fulfill his mandatory military obligations. “The exact timing hasn’t been decided,” he said on his upcoming enlistment and future plans. “It would be great if I could do one more film or drama before going (to the military).” Singer-turned-actress Choi said that shooting “Real” has awakened in her a yearning for acting. “I felt a sense of accomplishment. I wonder if I have ever wanted to do something as much as act,” she said.

Following is the first article in a three-part series that examines the impact of the unofficial hallyu ban on the Korean entertainment industry. --Ed. While Beijing has reportedly been banning Korean content within China since last August, the unstoppable flow of the Korean Wave, or Hallyu, seems to be seeping into the country through online channels. On a greater scale, drama production companies and Korean celebrities have incurred considerable losses due to China’s restrictions. Approval to air the much-anticipated TV series “Saimdang, Memoir of Colors” in China is still pending, while the series has already begun airing in Korea. Actor Song Joong-ki’s voice was removed from a TV advertisement in China, while actress Yoo In-na left the cast of Chinese drama series “Love Through a Millennium 2.” But it seems the unofficial circulation of content has proven less easy to control. Though unable to air on Chinese television, pirated files of the hit series “Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,” which aired only on Korean television from Dec. 2, 2016 to Jan. 21, complete with Chinese subtitles, are circulating the internet, according to reports. Clips of “The Legend of the Blue Sea,” another popular TV drama that aired only in Korea after the reported ban, are also being shared, while illegal streaming sites bearing the shows have popped up. No numbers are available on the views or downloads via these underground channels, but other visible figures attest to the unrelenting spread of Korean content. Gong Yoo, who starred in “Guardian,” became the most searched personality on Chinese social media network Weibo on Jan. 22 and 23. The series also ranked among the most searched terms on Chinese search engine Baidu. Over 420 million posts bearing the hashtag for Gong Yoo have been uploaded on Weibo, while songs from the series’ original soundtrack have reached over 8.8 million downloads on China’s largest music platform QQ Music. Taiwan’s United Daily News reported last Wednesday that “Guardian” had been the most watched drama series during the Chinese New Year holidays. “There’s a need to probe various channels, and not simply rely on the existing mainstream channels,” said Kim Hyun-kyung, head of the China Contents Lab. Kim also pointed out that regulation of content -- both local and foreign -- is nothing new in China. Though the stars are not able to monetize their success in China while the ban is still in place, their popularity has led to a surge in tourism of areas featured in the hit drama series. Chinese tourists have been flooding to Duksung Women’s University and to Incheon’s Jumunjin Beach, where “Guardian” was filmed, reports say. Korean celebrities’ continued popularity also showed through in “Power Star,” a list ranking the popularity of foreign celebrities within China. In January’s list, Sehun and Baekhyun of EXO and actors Kim Soo-hyun, Lee Jong-suk and Song Joong-ki ranked as the top five most popular male stars. As for female celebrities, f(x)’s Krystal, Girls’ Generation’s Yoona, solo singer IU and actresses Song Hye-kyo and Song Ji-hyo took the top spots. The reported ban additionally seems to be loosening on films coproduced by Korean and Chinese companies. “Beautiful Accident,” jointly produced by Chinese Studio Huayi Brothers and South Korean company Showbox, has been confirmed to open in Chinese theaters on March 17. Though Korean actors are not included among the cast, which features Chinese stars Chen Kun and Wang Jingchun and Taiwanese actress Gwei Lun-mei, Korean boy band EXO performs the theme song.

And when the K-pop wave went global, foreign language classes were added into the already harsh training regimes.　 　Now, in an age when K-pop stars’ every word and action are prone to scrutiny worldwide, agencies have started to focus on “character education,” which involves giving the singers comprehensive education in subjects ranging from basic etiquette to history and international politics. 　Minding manners 　 DSP Entertainment, which manages girls groups Kara and Rainbow, conducts internal education on what it calls “character development and basic etiquette.” 　“We teach our trainees how to greet people properly and how to address audiences and behave on TV shows,” said an official from the company. 　At Starship Entertainment, home to K-pop groups Sistar and Monsta X, trainees are taught how to speak politely and eloquently. 　“Our trainees have to follow rules like not swearing, not slurring speech and greeting people with loud, clear voices,” said an official there. “Before each team debuts, we offer specialized courses on giving interviews, which includes speaking coherently and responding to unexpected questions.” 　The agency also tends to their entertainers’ mental well-being and offers regular counseling.　 　JYP Entertainment, the K-pop powerhouse that represents groups like Twice, 2PM and Wonder Girls, has strict policies concerning schoolwork and “moral character.” 　“Our head producer Park Jin-young really values school and good morals,” said an official there. “Our trainees are not allowed to miss school unless absolutely necessary,” he said, while most other companies tend to prioritize training over school attendance. 　Bigger issues -- history, politics 　In areas that require more expertise, agencies invite university professors to give lectures or require entertainers to attend classes at the Korea Creative Content Agency’s Popular Culture and Arts Center, which began offering a “character education” program for K-pop singers and actors last year. 　The program includes classes on historical issues and cultural sensitivities, which are becoming increasingly important for K-pop celebrities to understand, according to the center’s director Jung Tae-sung. 　“In Islamic countries, for example, it’s taboo to hug fans or come into physical contact with them,” said Jung. “K-pop stars are branching out into more countries than ever now. They’re representing Korea abroad, which is why we felt it was necessary to offer a proper educational program.” 　For the Korean audience, history is a particularly delicate subject. Just last week, members Sulhyun and Jimin of girl group AOA drew flak when they were unable to identify a picture of An Jung-geun, a famous Korean independence activist. 　In 2014, actors Kim Soo-hyun and Jun Ji-hyun, stars of the hit drama series “My Love from the Star,” were heatedly criticized by local fans when they appeared on an ad for a Chinese mineral water brand that bears the Chinese name of Mt. Baekdusan, which lies on the border between Korea and China. 　Celebrities who show that they’re aware of historical issues, on the other hand, gain a huge boost in their public image. Last month, when actress Song Hye-kyo announced that she had refused to appear in an ad for Mitsubishi Motors, a company that had used Korean slave labor during World War II, local fans and media heaped praise on her. 　Knowledge of diplomatic relations is also important for K-pop groups, especially those that have members of different nationalities, Jung noted. 　In January, for example, when girl group Twice’s Taiwanese member Tzuyu held up a Republic of China flag on a television show, she was met with outrage from fans in China who condemned it as a gesture promoting the independence of Taiwan. The scandal prompted Tzuyu to upload a video apology, in which she stated “China and Taiwan are one.”　 　The Popular Culture and Arts Center also offers classes on subjects like social media usage and managing stress, essential for celebrities who are exposed to public opinion that is often negative, said Jung. Also available are activities involving crafts and personal storytelling to “enhance artistic creativity.” By Rumy Doo ()",kimsoohyun,3.0,"The article mentions Kim Soo-hyun briefly in the context of a historical controversy involving a Chinese ad, which relates to his work as an actor.

Experts have reportedly warned that the cliff face was unstable and could result in deadly rock falls due to having been previously used as a quarry up to 1994.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/907353,Could 'Descendants of the Sun' dethrone 'Moon Embracing the Sun'?,2016-03-24,,"Anticipation is growing after the South Korean drama ""Descendants of the Sun"" achieved what has been perceived as near impossible here with the rise of cable channels recently: a terrestrial drama garnering more than 30 percent of viewers nationwide. For those living under a rock, ""Descendants of the Sun"" is a popular KBS 2TV series that portrays the unlikely romance that develops between a South Korean special forces captain, Yoo Si-jin, and Dr. Kang Mo-yeon, who volunteers for a medical non-profit organization. They first meet in South Korea and then coincide again in the fictional war-ravaged country of Uruk. For the first time since premiering on Feb. 24 in both South Korea and China -- which made it the first South Korean show to do so -- the show was watched by more than 30 percent of viewers across South Korea on its ninth episode Wednesday. In Seoul, the figure passed that milestone two weeks ago, so it had been widely considered a matter of time for the nationwide figure to follow. The last terrestrial TV series to have reached that sacred territory was ""Moon Embracing the Sun,"" an MBC period drama from 2012. Considering that there has been a tectonic shift of sorts in the local TV scene in the past four years -- most notably, with the rapid ascent of cable channel tvN -- the feat by KBS 2TV is hoped to breathe life back into the terrestrial drama game, which has been in the doldrums for as long as one can remember. The ""Descendants of the Sun"" syndrome is also noteworthy in that the show was entirely pre-produced with no additional episodes to be made. The South Korean tradition has been to adjust the plot and characters on a real-time basis depending on the viewer response -- a practice that resulted in part due to producers' lack of confidence in their material. But while pre-production has remained something of a taboo here, producers at the Yeouido district in Seoul invested 13 billion won (US$11.1 million) in the project that they couldn't even say with certainty would take off. Combine that entrepreneurial spirit with the star-studded cast of actor Song Joong-ki and actress Song Hye-kyo, and pop writer Kim Eun-sook of ""Lovers in Paris"" and ""The Heirs,"" and we get the Asiawide sensation that is ""Descendants of the Sun."" There remains one more peak to scale for this Wednesday-Thursday night soap -- turning that first digit of viewership figure to 4. ""Moon Embracing the Sun"" is the last show to have broken the 40 percent mark in the past five years. That show, which marked actor Kim Soo-hyun's big TV break, surpassed 40 percent on its 16th episode, with the finale concluding with 42.2 percent. ""Descendants of the Sun"" -- which has been following more or less the same, early trajectory of the MBC classic -- might have a shot at similar success. And even if it doesn't, KBS insiders say, they are happy with a viewership greater than 20 percent. What ""Descendants of the Sun"" has also shown to South Korean TV producers is that a human interest, disaster-themed story -- and not always the typical romantic comedy between a rich man and an average woman or vice versa -- can be popular among viewers too. That such experimentation is appreciated by viewers has already been proven by tvN, the prolific cable network behind several drama successes, including the web cartoon-based office drama ""Misaeng,"" nostalgia-inducing coming-of-age story ""Reply 1988"" and time-travel crime thriller ""Signal."" It had remained to be seen, however, whether terrestrial channels would ever break away from their cookie-cutter style, risk-averse storytelling. ""Descendants of the Sun"" has done just that and is bound to open a new chapter for rival channels MBC and SBS. In China, by the way, the response has been explosive, too. On iQiyi, the local video streaming website that holds the broadcasting rights for ""Descendants of the Sun,"" a combined 1 billion searches for episodes, press releases and other posts related to the show have been noted. A college student reportedly contracted glaucoma after watching too many episodes in one sitting. Media reports also say a couple divorced because the show made the husband jealous. Another man is said to have undergone plastic surgery to please his Song Joong-ki-obsessed wife. Chinese security authorities have also warned their people on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, of the ""legal risks"" that may result from being too infatuated with actor Song. South Korean producers have long feared that ""My Love from the Star,"" an SBS sci-fi romantic comedy popular in late 2014 to early 2015, might have spelled the end of ""hallyu,"" or the Asiawide popularity of Korean pop culture, in China. But ""Descendants of the Sun"" seems to have disproved such concerns, as actor Song's manager attests. ""I've been getting a phone call every three minutes asking for business deals with Song Joong-ki,"" Kim Jung-yong said, adding he will exercise discretion in choosing which deals to pursue and which not to. ""I think we're going to have a lot of work to do in China.""

""Stairway to Heaven"" starring Kwon Sang-woo and Choi Ji-woo has recently been hovering around fifth in the local viewership ranking, according to the Korean Cultural Center in the South American country, with the SBS drama first hitting the air on Argentina's largest private television network Telefe on Feb. 10. Hallyu, or the Korean Wave, refers to the popularity of Korean television shows and pop songs around the world. Boosted by the drama's success, Telefe will soon broadcast two more Korean TV series -- ""My Love from the Star"" and ""Angel Eyes"" -- the center said in a release Thursday. ""My Love from the Star,"" starring actor Kim Soo-hyun and actress Jun Ji-hyun, became a huge sensation across Asia in 2014. The SBS drama tells the story of an alien from outer space who falls in love with a top actress. ""Angel Eyes,"" broadcast in 2014 on the same channel, is about two former lovers, who were forced to separate due to painful family issues, meeting each other again 12 years later. The center said another SBS series, ""Secret Garden,"" also captivated Argentine viewers when it was shown on the country's cable channel Magazine last year. It was the first Korean drama to be shown in Argentina. Reflecting this trend, the country's most influential daily Clarin on Wednesday allocated two pages to cover the recent wind of Korean TV dramas blowing into the country. The newspaper said the overseas success of Korean dramas is in large part attributable to Seoul's aggressive cultural policy, and this has generated a synergy effect in various fields of pop culture, such as films, K-pop and dramas, according to the center.

PandaKorea.com, the company’s website, has garnered 2 million members from China since its launch on Oct. 7, 2014. 　It has partnered with TMall, run by Alibaba, Union Pay mall, as well as Chinese cosmetics website meilishou to sell Korean products made by mostly local small- and midsize companies. 　Panda Korea now aims to sell 100,000 kinds of goods by Nov. 11 and hopes to generate 100 billion won in sales by the end of 2016 through two offline stores in Seoul and six more scheduled to open next year in China. The company is also pushing for initial public offerings in Korea and China around the same time. 　But perhaps what makes the company unique is its marketing strategy of mixing entertainment with retail. 　In December 2014, the company teamed up with entertainment agency Keyeast -- which became the second largest shareholder of Panda Korea – and started selling K-pop stars’ souvenirs. Pan-Asia celebrity Kim Soo-hyun, who has signed up with Keyeast, invested 2 billion won in the company, while Keyeast founder and top screen actor Bae Yong-joon invested 1 billion. 　“Panda Korea has a unique business model of being an enter-commerce company,” said the company CEO Lee Jong-sik during his interview with The Korea Herald on Tuesday. 　“Combined with our goal of becoming a global ‘B2B2C’ operator, we are confident that we will secure our position as the No. 1 Korean (goods) seller in China,” the journalist-turned-politician-turned-businessmen said. 　For instance, the company invested in the production of KBS TV drama, “The Producers,” which featured Kim Soo-hyun, who had attracted billions of won in product placement deals in the show, which has gained wide popularity in China. Merchandise such as Kim Soo-hyun calendars, mugs and notebooks are sold exclusively at PandaKorea.com. 　The company also has secured 100 seats for TV pop chart shows as well as K-pop concerts in order to promote its package tours to Korea. 　Moreover, Keyeast will produce promotional videos for some of the items sold at PandaKorea.com. These video clips will also be distributed via major Chinese online media platforms, including Sohu TV, QI, Yuku, Tencent TV and others. 　“Video clips are widely used in Chinese e-commerce sites because they give you more precise information about the product by showing the goods from 360 degree angles. We are also planning to make it fancier by adding the scenery of Myeong-dong in central Seoul where the products are also sold at our offline Panda Korea Shop,” Lee said. 　The glitzy-glamor of showbiz is just a part of what Panda Korea has to offer, Lee said. In order to contain consumers’ anxiety over whether they are buying fabricated items, Lee established the Korea Original Product Certificate Authority, which certifies the authenticity of the origin of products sold at not only Pandakorea.com but others. 　The company has also teamed up with local governments and businessmen to guarantee swift delivery, right from Korea to China. 　“It takes a day or two for the customs process and an extra day for delivery to megalopolises. For the second- or third-tier cities it takes 2-3 more days.

With an airtight plot about a group of grifters and hustlers who steal from the Bank of Korea with realistic and savvy dialogues, the heist film was not only critically acclaimed but also was a commercial hit, bringing in over 2 million moviegoers according to KOBIS, the Korean Film Council’s box office tracking service.As it turns out, that was just the warm-up. Choi’s sophomore film “Tazza: The High Rollers” in 2006 made him a household name with its colorful and dynamic portrayal of Korea’s card gambling underworld. With nearly 6 million seats filled, it was an unequivocal hit. The movie won him top honors at the prestigious Baeksang Arts Awards that year.The 2010 fantasy action movie “Woochi” took Choi’s filmography to a new direction. Starring the wide-eyed Kang Dong-won as a mythical hero chasing down goblins, the film was lauded as Korea’s answers to superhero blockbusters. “Woochi” brought in over 6 million viewers, marking another milestone for Choi.In 2012 came “Thieves,” the star-studded caper film that left Choi’s mark on the Korean cinema history. With its cast including Jun Ji-hyun, Kim Hye-soo, Kim Yun-seok, Lee Jung-jae and Kim Soo-hyun, Choi spun a tale of the masters of the underworld teaming up to steal a precious diamond in Macau. Choi’s strong characters, crisp dialogues and well-planned action sequences made the film the must-see of the year, eventually attracting nearly 13 million people to theaters.Although many people compare “Assassination” to “The Thieves” because of its strong ensemble (including Jun Ji-hyun and Lee Jung-jae from “The Thieves”) and grand-scheme storyline, Choi told the press ahead of the film’s release that “Assassination” was a new stylistic attempt. “I wanted it to be different from ‘The Thieves,’” he said. “I wanted to take out the cheerful, lively and skill-focused aspects and make it more classic.”Although “Assassination” has strong dialogues, he said the characters were designed to be more reserved. “While the personality of each character was revealed quickly in ‘The Thieves,’ in (“Assassination”) I wanted it to be slower, to make the audience understand the characters bit by bit.” “Assassination” ― about a group of freedom fighters targeting Japanese and pro-Japanese officials in the 1930s during Japan’s imperial rule of the Korean peninsula ― hit the 10 million mark in ticket sales on the 70th anniversary of Liberation Day on Aug. 15. It became the 12th Korean movie to hit the milestone, according to KOBIS.

The French wax museum’s first Asian branch presents 80 life-size wax models of world-renowned figures and celebrities, including 30 Koreans.   “We decided Seoul to be our first destination for Grevin Museum in Asia because the city has rich history and strong cultural content. From here, the Hallyu boom has spread throughout Asia,” said Dominique Marcel, CEO of the Compagnie des Alpes, which operates the museum, at a press conference Wednesday at the Grevin Museum in Seoul. The French firm also runs ski resorts and leisure facilities around the world. The Seoul museum, located near Myeong-dong, Seoul‘s hottest shopping district, presents wax figures of movie stars, celebrities, historic figures and politicians in the four-story building from the Japanese colonial era in the early 1900s. The wax figures are on display in different themed rooms. Popular Korean actors, such as Bae Yong-joon, Jang Dong-gun, Kwon Sang-woo and Song Seung-heon, greet visitors to a movie awards red carpet scene.   The television studio titled “Hallyuwood” features popular Korean actors and actresses, such as Kim Soo-hyun, Park Shin-hye, Lee Min-ho, Jang Keun-suk and Hyun Bin, filming shows and movies. “This is the world’s biggest exhibition featuring Hallyu stars ranging from the first generation stars to the latest ones,” said Kim Yong-gwan, president of Grevin Korea. Hollywood movie stars are also on view in interactive settings. Brad Pitt and George Clooney stand side by side, watching visitors play roulette. Robert De Niro welcomes visitors to a dimly lit bar. U.S. President Barack Obama, Queen Elizabeth II and secretary-general of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon are gathered in the same aircraft, accompanied by the noise and tremor felt in an actual flying aircraft.   The museum also attempts to impress visitors with a state-of-the-art audio and light system that helps them be fully immersed in the viewing experience and take quality selfies and photos. It expects to receive 450,000 visitors per year, including foreign tourists from other Asian countries, including China and Japan. “We found a great potential in Seoul for attracting many other Asian tourists. We hope the Grevin Seoul is one of the tourist attractions that tourists don’t want to miss,” said Marcel. The museum plans to add four to five new models each year in addition to the current list of figures. At the end of the museum tour, visitors can learn the steps of making wax figures and make their own wax figure with the special software that scans one’s face and turns it into a three-dimensional image. Compagnie des Alpes runs Grevin wax museums in Paris, Montreal and Prague. The first museum opened in 1882 in Paris. Tickets to the Seoul museum cost 23,000 won ($20) for adults, 18,000 won for teenagers and 15,000 won for younger children. For more information, call (02) 777-4700.

Dubbed “the most anticipated show of 2015” by industry insiders, the new KBS drama will take us behind the scenes, revealing all the craze of overnight editing and endless meetings that go into producing variety shows, and promises light-hearted fun and laughter on the way. The drama marks actor Kim Soo-hyun’s return to television after a one-year hiatus since the mega-hit drama “My Love from the Star.” In complete contrast to his role as charismatic alien Do Min-joon, this time, Kim will play a principled, book-smart rookie producer named Baek Seung-chan, who is painfully inarticulate, clumsy and not at all street-smart. “Everybody was a rookie at some point in their lives,” said Kim in a press conference in Seoul on Monday. “So my goal is to let people relate to my character and remember that time.” “He’s entirely clueless,” said Kim on his endearingly awkward role. “But he tries so earnestly not to be clueless, but that ends up irritating his superiors even more.” In the show, Baek is constantly berated by Tak Ye-jin, the temperamental producer of popular music program “Music Bank.” Played by actress Gong Hyo-jin, Tak gives rookie employees a hard time with her straightforwardness, but is ultimately “human,” said Gong, and does her fair share of comical blundering. “It’s the most aggravated, neurotic role I’ve ever taken on,” said the actress famed for sparking romantic chemistry in dramas like “Pasta” and “It’s Okay, That’s Love.” “In the first episode, there are almost no scenes of (Ye-jin) smiling. She’s dissatisfied with everything, always telling people what to do ... but she’s imperfect and human, and writer Park Ji-eun makes her so charming.” Alongside Gong’s character will be the hot-headed but soft-hearted variety show producer Ra Joon-mo, played by actor Cha Tae-hyun, who is well-loved for comic roles in box-office hits such as “My Sassy Girl” (2001). It was easy for the seasoned actor to imagine himself on the other side of the scene. “I’ve done so many things during the course of my career in the entertainment industry ― I’ve been a singer, an emcee, I’ve done radio and variety shows. I realized I’ve absorbed so much from all these experiences without even thinking about it,” said Cha. Completing the star-studded cast will be singer-actress IU, who will play the haughty pop diva Cindy ― nicknamed “ice princess” for her complete emotional command and icy demeanor. The singer said she observed and took tips from fellow singers to prepare for the role, but was also surprised at how similar the character was to her real-life self. “Everyone has that irritated, touchy side to them,” she said, explaining that she was able to relate to the character’s biting attitude. “But Cindy is not all mean. The more I study her, the more I learn that she’s an innocent soul.” IU added that she is writing a song based on the character. The drama has numerous references to real producer-directors like Na Young-seok and celebrity cameo appearances, including singer-producer and chief of JYP Entertainment Park Jin-young. Helmed by comedy and variety show producer Seo Soo-min and penned by “My Love from the Stars” writer Park Ji-eun, “The Producers” will air Fridays and Saturdays at 9:15 p.m. starting May 15 and continue for 12 episodes, with each episode lasting 70 minutes.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/471044,Soul and Seoul in the ‘Age of Ultron’,2015-04-22,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2015/04/22/20150422000924_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Director Joss Whedon dispenses with all introductions and jumps straight into the action in the hotly anticipated “Avengers: Age of Ultron.” The opening sequence kicks off with the Avengers raiding a HYDRA stronghold in the snowy mountains of Sokovia, kicking, punching and blasting their way to capture Loki’s powerful scepter. From there, the action never slows down throughout the 140-minute film screened for the media at CGV Wangsimni on Tuesday. But between the heavy gunfire and scorched metal, the “Age of Ultron” slips in an element that the first “Avengers” lacked: a look into the hearts and minds of Marvel’s most beloved heroes.  The story of an artificial intelligence peacekeeping program that takes on a twisted view of its mission and turns against humanity is sparked by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr). The jesting Iron Man turns somber at memorable points, offering glimpses into his most sincere ambitions. Stark’s ideas stir up the inner dilemmas of Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), who eventually aids Stark in building Ultron. The film also highlights the Hulk’s oscillations between his desire to help the Avengers and his fear of hurting civilians, made more complex and agonizing by a budding romance with Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson). The minds of the rest of the Avengers are opened up thanks to the introduction of an “enhanced” Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), the Scarlet Witch who can manipulate minds and tap into the characters’ innermost fears thanks to experiments run by Baron von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann). The audience gets a firsthand look at what those dark fears look like, with significant time devoted to the hallucinations of Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the Black Widow. A particularly notable effort in “Age of Ultron” is the attention paid to developing the personal stories of the Black Widow and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). The inner turmoil of the Avengers as well as those of the emotionally scarred Maximoff twins (Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson), the chillingly humanoid Ultron (Jeremy Spade) and mysterious Vision (Paul Bettany) unfold in carefully timed stages between the larger action scenes, breathing soul into the comic-book action. The movie will be a particular treat for fans in Korea to see roughly 20 minutes featuring the sights of Seoul. Ever since the cast arrived last year to shoot parts of the film, Korean fans have been eager to see what parts of the nation’s capital will be seen on the screen. The laboratories of Dr. Helen Cho (Kim Soo-hyun, also known as Claudia Kim) are pictured on Sebitseom floating on the Hangang River, the huge statues at the MBC headquarters in Digital Media City fill the screen as the superheroes fly by in the Quinjet, and Seoul’s skyline is caught across the glittering Hangang River as the Avengers fight atop Mapo Bridge. But the highlight is the clash between Ultron’s army of robots and the Avengers in downtown Seoul. Moviegoers see not only the alleys of Gangnam as Black Widow whizzes through on her motorcycle, but also the familiar sights of a Korean train and Korean police. As a bonus, there are snippets of untranslated Korean being spoken in the film by Kim and other extras, which can only be understood by Korean speakers. As of Wednesday morning, over 740,000 tickets in Korea have been booked for “Age of Ultron,” making up 94 percent of all movie ticket reservations, according to the Korean Film Council. With action scenes of immense scale, interesting characters both old and new, and storyline setups that hint at what is to come in future sequels, viewers have good reason to look forward to the film. However, there is a sense that the movie’s storyline buckles a bit under the weight of its numerous characters and stories, without a clean conclusion. It would be best to watch the film prepared to enjoy it fully, but conscious that it is ultimately a spectacular warm-up for the next big Avengers adventure. “Avengers: Age of Ultron” opens in local theaters Thursday, more than a week before its U.S. release.

The cast and crew of Marvel’s blockbuster “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” including director Joss Whedon, Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans, came to Seoul to promote the film ahead of its official opening. They were joined by Mark Ruffalo and Kim Soo-hyun at a press conference at the Conrad Hotel in Yeouido on Friday. “We really started the movie by coming here, and this is actually the hotel where Claudia auditioned for a role,” director Joss Whedon told a crowd of reporters. “To come back here at the end of what was quite a long, extraordinary process is a perfect circle.” The hype over the movie has been building since last year when part of the movie’s action scenes were shot in Seoul between March 30 and April 14. Scenes were filmed in areas near the Mapo Bridge, Gangnam, and the Hangang River. One fight scene involving the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) whizzing around on a motorcycle on the streets of Gangnam was noticeable in a clip shown at the press conference. “It’s overwhelming. It’s a beautiful city and you’re very welcoming at the airport,” said Chris Evans (who plays Captain America) about his third experience in Seoul. “Anytime you have to shoot abroad and you disrupt the rhythm of the city, you feel responsible. But you were so welcoming and we felt so at home here. Like one of the Beatles.” Robert Downey Jr., who seemed at most ease in front of the Korean press, offered his ideas on what his on-screen persona Iron Man would do if he were in the city of Seoul. “I’ve given this some consideration, and I’m down to several finalists,” he said. “First, I would like to offer a shuttle service from downtown to the airport. I think I can take three passengers at a time,” he joked. “That (also) tied with Tony’s BBQ, where you put small bits of meat and poultry on my chest and I fry it.” Mark Ruffalo, who plays the Hulk, was in Korea for the first time ― and had high expectations. “I quite expect to be dragged into the crowd and taken off into a wild night of fun and adventure, and to be placed back in my bed in my hotel room tonight swaddled in Korean silk,” he said, laughing. The sequel to the 2012 megahit has special meaning for Whedon ― the film is his last in the “Avengers” series. “I don’t know whether I’ll be continuing to work for Marvel in some other capacity,” he said. “I’ll probably just show up now and again to tell everyone what to do.” The film also holds significance for Korea. Some of the cast included Korean stars, including actress and model Kim Soo-hyun, who played Dr. Helen Cho, a world-renowned geneticist who aids the Avengers in their endeavors. “I didn’t hear a lot about the character of Helen Cho when I was first cast,” she said. “I did a lot of research on Amadeus Cho, and I completely trusted (Whedon). He carefully crafted each character to fit them to the cast.” The film was also shot in several other locations around the world, including Italy and South Africa. “The Avengers: Age of Ultron” brings Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Thor, and the rest of the Avengers crew together to protect humanity against a villainous Ultron. The film opens in Korea on April 23.

From technology to real estate, the newly emerging Chinese superrich have been eyeing the Korean market, looking for ways to expand their businesses. Ma Huateng, founder of Internet service company Tencent, recently joined forces with Hana Financial Group with the aim of introducing the mobile payment system Tenpay in Korea. Tenpay holds the second-largest market share for online payments in China, followed by Alibaba Group’s Alipay.  Ma also invested 72 billion won ($65 million) in KakaoTalk in 2012, becoming the third-largest shareholder for Daum Kakao, which holds Korea’s largest mobile gaming platform. He is also the third-largest shareholder in game company Netmarble, which may give him some influence over the Korean game industry in the near future. Chinese superrich are also stepping into the entertainment industry. Fu Meicheng, president of Huace Film & TV, is one of the most influential media moguls in China and ranks as the country’s 71st-richest man. Forbes estimated his total assets to be $1.6 billion. Fu recently invested 53.5 billion won in the film company NEW (which produced the 2013 film “The Attorney”), becoming its second-largest shareholder. Huace Media also recently coproduced the popular drama “Kill Me, Heal Me” with Korea’s Pan Entertainment. Another person involved in the entertainment industry is Charles Zhang, founder of Internet company Sohu. Zhang, one of China’s “New Rich” and selected by Forbes as one of China’s richest in 2010 with assets of $700 million at the time, invested 15 billion won and become the second-largest shareholder in entertainment agency KEYEAST, home to Hallyu stars Bae Yong-joon and Kim Soo-hyun.  The Chinese superrich have also turned their attention to Korean real estate. Zhang Yuliang, president of Greenland Holding Group, has been developing a 1 trillion won health care town in Seogwipo City, Jejudo Island, since November 2011. Zhang also took over the multicomplex Dream Tower project in Nohyeong-dong, Jeju City ― which had been stalled for over 30 years ― and announced an additional $600 million investment on the island. Last July, around 250 Chinese millionaires visited Korea along with Chinese President Xi Jinping, showing clear interest in the Korean market. Multiple Chinese business tycoons have also said they hope to make their businesses as influential worldwide as Samsung and other Korean companies. With the Korea-China FTA, it appears that Chinese superrich will enter the Korean market to test their luck at a greater speed with their immense capital and experience serving a domestic market of 1.3 billion people.

As he mulls a comeback after last year’s insanely popular TV series “My Love from the Star,” the actor lands on top of The Korea Herald’s list of stars to watch in 2015.   In the K-pop scene, the formidable popularity of EXO, the brainchild of K-pop mogul and SM Entertainment chairman Lee Soo-man, is expected to grow, earning the boys another spot on the list. Based on a survey of 80 experts, observers and entertainment industry insiders, conducted by The Herald Business, the sister paper of The Korea Herald, here are the four stars whose name you will be hearing a lot throughout the year. What’s next for Kim Soo-hyun? After a flurry of leading roles in hit TV dramas “Dream High,” “Moon Embracing the Sun,” and the wildly successful “My Love from the Star,” Kim has established himself as arguably the most sought-after actor under 30 in South Korea.   His most recent role as the charmingly cynical undercover alien Do Min-joon alongside Jun Ji-hyun, who plays the bewitching actress Chun Song-yi, cemented his celebrity status not only nationwide but also overseas. Following the show’s explosive success abroad, Kim spent a large part of 2014 touring Asia to meet fans. The actor wrapped up his lucrative year by winning Best Actor at the SBS Drama Awards. Ten months after his last role, however, Kim is yet to announce his next big project. Though considered for upcoming TV shows “A Scholar Walks the Night” and “Doctor Frankenstein,” he ended up declining both parts. Observers say that 2015 will be a pivotal year in shaping the remainder of the actor’s career. Kim’s next move will be to follow up on his meteoric rise and carefully select what may be his last work before his mandatory military service. Yim Si-wan: from K-pop idol to actor Originally a member of 9-member boy band Z:EA, Yim Si-wan first demonstrated his flair for acting in a supporting role in “Moon Embracing the Sun.” In 2014, however, Yim fully came into his own and enjoyed massive popularity when he took up the lead in the critically and publically acclaimed tvN drama “Misaeng (Incomplete Life).” Portraying the struggles of Jang Geu-rae, a meek but hardworking employee in a fiercely competitive work environment, Yim won over the sympathies of the typical office worker in modern Korea. Amid a flood of offers, Yim, too, is said to be reviewing his options before deciding on his next role. EXO readies for comeback Setting themselves apart in the thick of idol bands that flood the K-pop scene in ever greater numbers, group EXO enjoyed outstanding popularity both in Korea and overseas. According to German music ranking company Media Traffic, EXO’s single “Overdose” sold more than 447,000 copies across the globe, a significant achievement in today’s grim record market. While EXO did go through a rough patch last year with two Chinese members, Kris and Luhan, leaving the group, the remaining 10 were able to dispel fans’ worries by delivering an immaculate performance and announcing their comeback for 2015 in December. No further details of the comeback have been released.

The periodic action flick “Roaring Currents” drew 17.6 million viewers becoming the most-watched film of all time, while three other films joined the coveted 10 million viewer’s club, including “The Attorney,” “Frozen,” and “Interstellar.” This year is also marked with a stellar lineup of new films from local heavyweight directors to Hollywood blockbusters ― some starring Korean actors. Here’s what we have to look forward to in 2015. Return of star directors “Gangnam 1970” is the final installment of director Yoo Ha’s trilogy of “street series,” dubbed after his first two films that depicted street gangsters ― “Once Upon a Time in High School” (2004) and “A Dirty Carnival” (2006).   The noir action film is set against the backdrop of an exploding real estate market in Seoul’s Gangnam district in the 1970s, a turbulent era under the dictatorship of military strongman Park Chung-hee. Two childhood friends find themselves forced to become enemies, mired with misunderstanding, revenge and conspiracy. The film marks heartthrob Lee Min-ho's first leading role in a film as he joins actor Kim Rae-won. The film opens in theaters on Jan. 21. Following 2012’s box-office hit “The Thieves”― which garnered 12.98 million viewers ― director Choi Dong-hoon is back with another star-studded flick “The Assassination.” Actress Jun Ji-hyun and actor Lee Jung-jae from “The Thieves” star with actors Ha Jung-woo and Cho Jin-woong. The film tells the story of assassins taking out a pro-Japanese group set in Shanghai and Seoul in 1930s. The film is slated for release in July. Renowned director Im Kwon-taek’s 102nd film “Revivre” will be released here in March, following the critically acclaimed premiere at last year’s Venice Film Festival. Based on Korean author Kim Hoon’s award-winning novel “Hwajang” (Korean word with two meanings: makeup and cremation), the film centers on a top marketing executive at a major cosmetic company (played by veteran actor Ahn Sung-ki) who falls in love with a young woman when his wife is dying of a brain tumor. It is Ahn’s seventh film with the director. More Hollywood glory days? Riding on the success of last year’s Hollywood flicks, including “Frozen” and “Interstellar,” this year also brings a lineup of imported blockbusters, peppered with Korean actors, vying to win over the hearts of cinemagoers here. “The Avengers: Age of Ultron,” a highly anticipated superhero sequel to the 2012 box office hit, will arrive in the theaters in April. The viewers will finally be able to see the superheroes fighting their battles in different venues in Seoul, including Mapo Bridge, Saebit Dungdungseom and Gangnam district, as the flick was filmed here last March. Marvel Comics’ favorite heroes, including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), assemble again to battle their new nemesis Ultron (James Spader). Newcomers for this edition feature Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Dr. Cho, a friend of Iron Man played by Korean actress Kim Soo-hyun. The Wachowski brothers, credited with the hit movies “The Matrix” and “Cloud Atlas,” are delivering another mind-boggling sci-fi thriller “Jupiter Ascending” in February. Korean actress Bae Doo-na will appear in her second Wachowski film ― after “Cloud Atlas” in 2012 ― alongside Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum and Eddie Redmayne. Actor Lee Byung-hun stars in “Terminator Genisys,” the fifth installment in the “Terminator” series which is said to serve as a sequel, prequel and reboot to the series. Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns to his Terminator role after a hiatus from the fourth installment.

Jun, 35, won the Grand Prix with “My Love from the Star,” one of the greatest hits for her and the television broadcaster alike. The SAF recognized the hallyu actress for her outstanding acting and the drama’s stunning ratings and popularity at home and overseas. Prior to the award ceremony, some drama critics had suggested that Jun and Kim might share the top accolade. The results were more or less undisputed largely due to the public sentiment that the Grand Prix must take into account not just the actors’ role but their acting career and experience. “Thank you, it is refreshing to stand here because the drama (‘My Love from the Star’) was being broadcast around this time a year ago,” Jun said during her acceptance speech. The actress also acknowledged the drama’s producer Jang Tae-yoo and scriptwriter Park Ji-eun, her fellow actors and production crew, her husband and, above all, Kim Soo-hyun. She said, “My amazing costar, Kim Soo-hyun, thank you so much. I wouldn’t have won the award without you. Thank you.” She also shook up the Coex convention hall with her thank-you comment to her husband. She said in an ingratiating nasal voice, “Honey, don’t you ever fall asleep tonight.” Jun’s award was announced after Kim, winner of the Best Actor Award in the mid-length drama category, was called to the stage. Kim, 28, stood at the podium and thanked his family, his agency and the production crew. Sobbing, the actor said, “Thank you so much, my beloved mother, elder aunt, younger aunt and father, I love you always.” “My thanks also goes to producer Jang Tae-yoo and scriptwriter Park Ji-eun of ‘My Love from the Star.’ I also owe the whole staff who worked for the drama. My dearest Chun Song-yi, Ji-hyun nuna (older sister), Kim Chang-wan, Shin Sung-rok, Park Hae-jin, Yoo In-na, Ahn Jae-hyun and other colleagues, senior and junior actors, I owe you all.” Kim also mentioned the enormous pressure he feels whenever he plays a new character. “I get scared when I set out on a new project, because I still lack in experience. I was scared about playing Do Min-jun (in ‘My Love from the Star’) because he was such a fresh character. But I will march on with more projects in the future. I am still a half-baked actor, but I ask for your support in the days to come.” The SAF gave various drama awards to other actors from “My Love from the Star.” In the mid-length drama section, the festival conferred the Special Acting Award to Kim Chang-wan, the Excellent Actor Award to Shin Sung-rok and the New Star Award to Ahn Jae-hyun. In the full-length drama category, the Best Actor Award went to Lee Je-hoon of “Secret Door” and the Best Actress Award to Hwang Jung-eum of “Endless Love.” In the short drama section, the Best Actress Award went to Park Shin-hye of “Pinocchio.” In the mini series section, the Best Actor Award went to JYJ’s Park Yoo-chun of “Three Days” and the Best Actress Award to Gong Hyo-jin of “It’s Okay, That’s Love.” The Teen Star Award went to several hallyu stars, including JYJ’s Park Yoo-chun, Kim Soo-hyun, Jun Ji-hyun, Han Ye-sul, Park Shin-hye, Lee Jong-suk, Lee Je-hoon, Joo Sang-wook, Hwang Jung-eum and Jo In-sung.

The 10 categories range from books and movies to cars and imported beer, to big gainers on the stock market and top local brands ― a wide array of fields that offer an intriguing glimpse into Koreans’ preferences this year. There’s no question that a host of cultural milestones were set this year. Period flick “Roaring Currents” broke every record on its path to becoming the most-watched movie here, attracting a whopping 17.6 million viewers. SBS TV drama “My Love from the Star” was a phenomenal hit not only in Korea, but throughout Asia, catapulting actor Kim Soo-hyun into stardom. Outside of the entertainment field, Koreans continued to favor Samsung Electronics, the maker of Galaxy smartphones, as their favorite brand. On the stock market, however, the star was indisputably the cosmetics-maker AmorePacific.

The Korea Tourism Organization (KTO) and Baidu signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly collect and analyze big data derived from China's No. 1 search engine to more accurately gauge market trends and introduce customized tour programs.    South Korea has become one of the most popular destinations among Chinese travelers with the Korean pop culture boom in recent years. Some 4.68 million Chinese tourists came here in the first nine months of this year, nearly triple the number of Japanese tourists who used to be the biggest group of foreign visitors, according to the Korea Culture and Tourism Institute.    ""We will analyze Baidu's big data to use it to better target Chinese tourists from next year,"" Lee Jae-sung, KTO's international tour marketing director, said during a signing ceremony in Seoul. ""We will also share useful data with related industries to support their businesses.""   ""Baidu will provide tour-related data in China to help (the KTO) establish marketing strategies based on the scientific analysis of demand,"" said Anne Xu, general manager of the user product marketing department at Baidu.    The Beijing-based company said it will place a direct link to the KTO's Chinese webpage on Baidu Zhidao, a Chinese language encyclopedia similar to Wikipedia.    According to KTO-Baidu joint data, 55 percent of netizens who typed ""Korea tour"" into the search engine were female, with women in their 20s and 30s most interested in traveling to South Korea.    Chinese from the capital city Beijing generated the highest mobile traffic related to Korea tours, followed by big cities on the east coast, including Shanghai, Zheziang and Guangdong, data showed. People in western China searched less about Korea.    Searches on group tours to South Korea nearly tripled over the past four years, while those in their 30s were more interested in individual tour programs, data indicated.    Kim Soo-hyun, a Korean actor who starred in the hit drama ""My Love from the Star,"" topped the list of favorite celebrities.

Minutes before the start of the pan-continental sports festival, South Korean boy band EXO entered the stage amid a boisterous crowd. Dedicated fans packed one side of the stadium and screamed as the group performed its 2013 hits ""Wolf"" and ""Growl."" In Part One of the opening ceremony, actor Jang Dong-gun walked on stage to pick up a hoop that slipped out of a girl's hand. He reappeared later in the ceremony with more South Korean celebrities. In Part Two, opera singer Jo Sumi picked up where Jang had left off with a stirring performance of ""The Song of Asiad,"" a musical rendition of a poem written by renowned poet Ko Un, and ""Arirang,"" a popular Korean folk song. A video featuring actor Kim Soo-hyun, who has huge followings in China, was screened next. The ""My Love from the Star"" actor was seen on a boat next to the girl holding the hoop. Dozens of other passengers, dressed in traditional costumes of the Asiad participating countries, joined them. Kim then materialized before a blissful mass, and Jang joined him as they conveyed a message of hope to bring the continent together. Ock Joo-hyun, a South Korean idol-turned-musical actress, put on a musical act. And actor Hyun Bin carried the South Korean flag on stage amidst a raucous audience in Part Three. But director Im Kwon-taek, the chief organizer of the ceremony, knew how to save the best for last. K-pop group JYJ jumped on stage with the official Asiad song, ""Only One,"" as South Korean star athletes, one by one, delivered the Asiad torch to Lee Young-ae, a South Korean actress widely popular all over the continent. The ""Daejanggeum"" star had been hiding behind the crowd until a spotlight brought her to attention. The stadium boiled to a frenzy when she lit the cauldron, which marked the highlight of the night. The crown jewel of the three-hour event, however, was none other than South Korean rapper Psy, who rose to global stardom in 2012 with the mega-hit single ""Gangnam Style."" Dressed to the nines, Psy gave a funky re-make of ""Champion,"" one of his early favorites, alongside Chinese pianist Lang Lang. He capped off the show with ""Gangnam Style,"" which in May became the first video on YouTube to surpass 2 billion views. Im and fellow director Jang Jin delivered a stellar show, which cost just a fraction of what was needed to stage the epic ceremony that opened the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

But it is also helping Korean manufacturers expand in the Southeast Asian market with their consumer products. It is allowing them to promote their goods as “fashionable and friendly” to local consumers. “I tell people that this cream is the teardrop of Kim Soo-hyun, the actor who played the protagonist in the Asia-wide hit TV drama, ‘Moon Embracing the Sun,’ and people like it,” said Lee Seung-jae, CEO of Aroma Newtech, a mid-size cosmetics company, at the Korea Sourcing Fair in Jakarta last week. The hand cream was made with water from the Dogo hot spring in Asan, South Chungcheong Province, which was used as one of the shooting locations for Kim’s 2012 drama. Lee rubbed the cream on his hand to show off its moisturizing effects to a group of local buyers at his booth. “It definitely captures our eyes and ears when we hear about Kim Soo-hyun because he is a hot celebrity here,” said Lin Binbo, a merchandiser at the event, which is hosted by the Korea International Trade Association. “When a product is introduced and you have a Korean star involved, it surely makes the product look sophisticated but familiar.” Aroma Newtech is among 31 Korean companies that joined KITA’s trade show, the first of its kind that the association has held in the Indonesian capital. KITA said each company had up to 20 pre-arranged meetings. Ranging from medical needles for cosmetic surgery to colorful wrapping paper, smartphone holders, health supplements and skin care products, businessmen sought to attract buyers who could open doors for those seeking to enter the Indonesian market. “As the people’s income rises, with the KITA noting that 56.7 percent of the some 240 million people in Indonesia are classified as middle class, we are seeing an increase in demand for beauty (products), health supplements and other consumer goods. And I believe hallyu has boosted Korean products’ positive image,” said Park Gwi-hyun, director of the Asia and Oceania Department at the trade association. Some industry experts said that business people should take more advantage of hallyu. “I suggested that they decorate their booth more colorfully, and adopt an image using the Korean Wave whether they are related to it or not,” said Jung Sung-sook, head of Global Sources Korea, a Hong Kong-based media company that co-hosted the trade show. “The main reason Indonesians are becoming more attracted to Korean products is clearly because of hallyu. They think it is colorful and unique. And image matters to them.” Indonesia is Korea’s eighth-largest export market, and is 11th-biggest source of imports. Korea’s exports to Indonesia reached $6 billion in the first half of 2014, and Korea imported $6.3 billion worth goods in the same period.

Whereas the Korean actor’s overseas activities have so far only included Japan, his agency seeks to present him to a broader audience throughout Asia, following his success on MBC TV show “Empress Ki.” Ji’s popularity has been rising on the back of his role on “Empress Ki,” which drew up a stunning 28.7 percent viewer rating in the 51st and final episode on April 29.  In the second half this year, Ji will be visiting 10 Asian countries, including China, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Indonesia, where MBC was authorized to air the drama. The visit is part of the drama’s overseas promotions. Previously, Ji’s international activities were largely kept to Japan. He also starred in musicals “The Three Musketeers” and “The Days,” both staged there.  Ji’s agency also has two fan meetings arranged, on May 17 at Yomiuri Hall in Tokyo and on June 7 at Theater Brava in Osaka.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3710625,Credit card use falls 4% after ferry disaster,2014-04-27,,"The recent ferry sinking that claimed the lives of at least 188 people is damaging the consumer sentiment, as many Koreans remain shocked by the tragedy. A variety of data showed that a huge of number of people have canceled social and personal gatherings and trips after April 16, when the ferry capsized. According to a major credit card company, its customers’ average daily credit card use dropped by 4.4 percent, or 8.7 billion won ($8.2 million), from April 16-22, compared to the same period a month earlier. The issuer noted that their card use had been increasing by 0.6 percent a day between April 9-15, compared to the same period in March. Another firm’s data also showed that consumers’ credit use had been climbing in early April, but fell after the catastrophe. Some analysts forecast that the lackluster consumption ― if it continues for weeks or months ― could hold back economic growth, while policymakers have been striving to spur the economy. “GDP growth could stay below the projection (3.9 percent) of the Bank of Korea because the consumption growth has slowed again after the ferry Sewol accident,” said professor Oh Jung-keun of Korea University. An official of Statistics Korea said the state-run agency is closely monitoring economic indices amid uncertainty after the disaster. Some economists, however, predicted that the slowdown in consumption would be temporary. They cited past cases such as the collapse of Seongsu Bridge in 1994, the collapse of Sampoong Department Store in 1995 and the arson at Daegu Metro in 2003. Those disasters were not linked to an annual fall in consumer sentiment, though they negatively affected it for a short time. However, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and the earthquake-led tsunami had negative impacts on the yearly figures for the overall economy in the U.S. and Japan, respectively. Recently, Samsung Group decided not to hold its TED-like event later this month, which the firm holds on a regular basis. LG Group postponed a gala show featuring gymnast Son Yeon-jae until the latter half of this year, and its affiliate LG Household & Healthcare last week canceled a fan meeting for Kim Soo-hyun, an actor from the hit TV show “My Love from the Star.” Korea’s three major mobile carriers ― SK Telecom, KT and LG Uplus ― also joined the mourning by scaling down the size of their planned events.

Yang decided to donate after a senior staff meeting on April 24. Yang also stressed that “YG Entertainment will see to it that the funds will be delivered directly to the families of those who fell victim to the tragedy.” Over the years, Yang and his artists have carried out philanthropic activities through WITH. Last year, Yang contributed 100 million won to aid young heart disease patients through the Dream Gift campaign, jointly launched with Yonsei University’s Severance Hospital. In March 2013, the CEO donated 1 billion won to less-fortunate child patients in Korea. The money was from cash dividends he received from YG Entertainment as a majority shareholder. For the time being, YG Entertainment is likely to put its artists’ activities on hold out of respect for the ferry accident victims and their families. His donation came after a number of celebrities made donations for the ferry disaster victims. Actor Kim Soo-hyun, who starred in SBS’ “My Love from the Star,” will donate 300 million won. Actor Song Seung-heon, actress Ha Ji-won, and the actor and actress couple Seol Kyeong-gu and Song Yoon-ah each donated 100 million won. Figure skater Kim Yu-na also donated 100 million won.

In 2013, The Face Shop, owned by LG Household & Healthcare, saw sales rise about 20 percent on-year to a record high of 523 billion won ($503.7 million). The stellar performance was mainly thanks to a rise in overseas sales. According to the company, the proportion of such sales in its revenue portfolio reached a new high of 25 percent that year. “The Face Shop has definitely jumped ahead of its local rivals such as Missha and Etude House in the global market,” Park said. Since opening its first overseas shop in Taiwan in 2004, The Face Shop has opened 1,418 outlets in 27 countries. “The brand mission offering quality natural beauty products at an affordable price was something new on the global beauty scene at the time, and that is why The Face Shop appealed to Asian consumers in such a short period of time,’’ Kim Hee-jeong, team leader of overseas marketing at The Face Shop, told The Korea Herald. The brand further strengthened its competitive edge after it was acquired by LG Household & HealthCare in 2010. The rising popularity of Korean culture through the Korean Wave also helped local beauty brands increase their brand awareness overseas. Aware of such results, The Face Shop has been appointing top-tier K-pop and K-drama stars as brand ambassadors for global marketing campaigns since 2011. Singer Suzy from miss A is an ambassador for its chia seed skin care line. The Face Shop recently signed a contact with actor Kim Soo-hyun to promote products in China. “We don’t compete with local rivals overseas anymore. Instead, we want to focus on other global brands such as The Body Shop or L’Occitane,” Kim said. In Asia, The Face Shop is focusing on China and Japan. In 2013, the brand set up a joint venture with China’s Fo Shan to build a direct brand management system in the country. “Expanding in the Chinese market is the key to success,’’ said an official from LG Household & Healthcare. Last year, The Face Shop reaped 45 billion won in sales in China, accounting for 40 percent of overseas sales. The company expects the figure to increase to 70 billion won this year. In Japan, The Face Shop has partnered with Aeon, a leading Japanese retail group running convenience stores, supermarket chains and drug stores nationwide. The Face Shop has also started increasing its number of directly managed road shops. Outside of Asia, the beauty brand has been approaching the Middle East. “The demand for beauty products of The Face Shop is growing faster than expected in the region,’’ said Kim.

Of 642 female participants, 27.4 percent picked “interest in Korean culture and language” as a reason for willingness to date a Korean man, followed by 13.1 percent replying to “Korean men seem diligent and responsible.” On the other hand, 505 male participants had a different stance on why they would like to date a Korean woman. About 23.2 percent said “pretty face” was the reason while 16.2 percent picked “a lot of aegyo.” Aegyo is a Korean word that has the closest meaning to winsome and it is used mostly by women, balancing sweetness, cuteness, poutiness, modesty, thoughtfulness and submissiveness. About 40 percent of the respondents said that they would not like to date a Korean because of ”cultural differences.” In the survey, female respondents picked actor Kim Soo-hyun as the most sought-after male Korean celebrity while male foreigners selected actress Jun Ji-hyun.

Although the Korean entertainment business may still be in its infancy compared to the breadth of those overseas like Hollywood, it has nonetheless bred some very wealthy performer-turned-producers and entertainment company CEOs, who are now worth billions of won in assets. The Korea Herald has dug deeper into the four most famous moneybags in Korean show business. Lee Soo-man, SM Entertainment CEO 268.7 billion won, SM’s 2013 sales 1 trillion won, SM’s 2013 total market value 203.8 billion won, Value of stocks owned The wealthiest man in the local entertainment business is CEO Lee Soo-man of SM Entertainment. Lee owns 4,392,368 shares, roughly worth 203.8 billion won ($193.6 million), of SM Entertainment and is also the industry’s richest man in terms of real estate. The standard market price for two of the buildings he owns in Apgujeong-dong, an upscale neighborhood in Seoul, is 19.08 billion won. However, if put on the market, they are expected to fetch at least 56 billion won. Separately, Lee’s frequent trouble with the law seems to precede his reputation. In 2002, he was indicted on suspicion of embezzlement, while in 2004 he was sentenced to two years in prison with a three-year stay of execution. Lee again stood at the center of gossip early this year due to growing suspicions of attempted tax evasion through a paper company, which he reportedly used to purchase a luxury vacation home in Los Angeles. SM claims that the corporation in dispute has no connection to Lee and that the money he had used to buy the residence was already reported to the appropriate authorities. Yang Hyun-suk, YG Entertainment CEO 116.3 billion won, YG’s 2013 sales 660 billion won, YG’s 2013 total market value 195 billion won, Value of stocks owned   Back in the day when Yang Hyun-suk was a member of Korean pop group Seo Taiji & Boys, his nickname was “Yang Goon,” which was mainly derived from his sluggish look in contrast to his rather sophisticated and classy hip-hop music. However, Yang appears the complete opposite of this naive image when it comes to business instincts in seizing opportunities. His share value as the chief executive of YG Entertainment is a sizable 195 billion won. Apart from YG’s ability as an entertainment management agency to scope out and produce idol groups that have very unique and distinct personalities, such as Big Bang and 2NE1, luck was also with the company. Unlike most entertainment agencies that struggle to get listed, YG succeeded in becoming a public corporation at the end of 2011 on its first try. At about the same time, YG artist Psy stormed the global charts with his viral sensation “Gangnam Style,” providing synergy for the agency. Park Jin-young, JYP Entertainment CEO 21.3 billion won, JYP’s 2013 sales 193.7 billion won, JYP’s 2013 total market value 31.8 billion won, Value of stocks owned   Although JYP Entertainment, led by singer-producer Park Jin-young, is deemed one of the big three entertainment agencies alongside SM and YG, it falls short of the two in overall scale. JYP’s total sales turnover for 2013 was 21.3 billion won, but the company suffered a loss of 2.5 billion won. In the same year, SM recorded 268.7 billion won in sales and 40.5 billion won in profits, whereas YG reported sales of 116.3 billion won and profits of 22.2 billion won. Park’s stock assets are also a relatively thin 31.8 billion won. If considering the history of JYP Entertainment, however, the reasons are clearer Park is known to often go off the deep end, frequently challenging himself in order to explore places where others have not gone. For instance, he persistently had his artists, such as Rain (formerly part of JYP) and the Wonder Girls, attempt debuts in the United States, while he himself would also produce music overseas. JYP is understood as having continuously experimented while directly targeting the hub of pop culture. Bae Yong-joon, KEYEAST’s largest shareholder 69.5 billion won, KEYEAST’s 2013 sales 197.8 billion won, KEYEAST’s 2013 total market value 65.8 billion won, Value of stocks owned Representing the first generation of hallyu stars, Bae Yong-joon is the largest stockholder of KEYEAST, an agency mainly comprised of actors, with 21,900,510 shares or 65.8 billion won. Unlike SM’s Lee Soo-man or YG’s Yang Hyun-suk, Bae does not own any real estate assets besides his 5 billion won home in Seongbuk-dong. Yet he takes part in various activities revolving around hallyu. Other celebrities that belong to KEYEAST include actors Kim Hyun-joong and Kim Soo-hyun, who are on the rise to becoming the second generation of hallyu stars. In 2011 and 2012, Bae also produced two series of the drama “Dream High,” which gained tremendous popularity worldwide thanks to a cast of popular idol stars currently at the top of K-pop. Moreover, he runs several Korean restaurants in Japan and is involved in spreading the Korean culture to the rest of the world.

The move comes after rival Tous Les Jours’ hit an unexpected jackpot in China where sales almost doubled over the past weeks thanks to the soaring popularity of its commercial model Kim Soo-hyun, the drama’s other star. “In China, Paris Baguette used to be more widely known among customers due to its wide network of some 140 stores. But now customers are lining up in front of Tous Les Jours stores to get the leaflets with Kim Soo-hyun’s photos,” said an industry source. But with Jeon, Paris Baguette seems to be have been given a good chance to reverse the trend, hinting at another round of competition between the two Korean rivals in the crucial Chinese bakery market. In China, the demand for high-end caf and bakeries are surging along with the nation’s income levels, but many French big names such as Paul were forced to withdraw as they failed to appease the local tastes. In the meantime, the two Korean brands, taking advantage of the emerging K-pop sensation in the country, started entering the market in the mid 2000s by developing bakery items specialized for the Chinese palate. Paris Baguette, which boasts 124 stores in China alone, is expected to up its offensive for more market share, while Tous Les Jours with only 45 stores will be focusing on its premium strategy. On Monday, Tous Les Jours, owned by CJ Foodville, opened its first premium store “Tous Les Jours Boulangerie & Bistro” in the Wangjing district of Beijing. During a 10-day trial operation before the official opening, the store attracted some 1,000 visitors a day, despite setting prices about 15 percent higher than the brand’s other outlets, said a CJ spokesperson. “The space itself offers a new lifestyle.

The shooting for “The Avengers: the Age of Ultron,” a highly-anticipated sequel to the 2012 mega-hit film, began at Mapo Bridge as part of its two-week stint in Korea, blocking all lanes on the bridge for nearly 12 hours from early in the morning. Much of the details are being kept under wraps, including the plot and who will appear in the scenes filmed here. The bridge scene was said to involve large-scale action and feature at least one of the heroes Captain America, played by Chris Evans. “Age of Ultron” reunites Earth’s mightiest heroes, including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Captain America (Chris Evans) and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Coulson (Clark Gregg) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders). Newcomers include Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Vision (Paul Bettany) and Ultron (James Spader). Other than Evans and Korean actress Kim Soo-hyun, who plays “a substantial supporting role,” it is not known who from the cast will join the Seoul shoot. According to local reports, Seoul will be featured as a high-tech city, from where the enemies steal a powerful new technology that the heroes try to reclaim. The “Saebit Dungdungseom,” a city-owned, man-made island floating on the Han River and another location in Seoul where the film will be shot, will be used as the cutting-edge science lab where the technology is developed and where Soo-hyun works as a genius scientist, according to the reports. Sunday’s filming on Mapo Bridge forced buses to take alternative routes and nearby subway gates to close. Despite the traffic disruptions, there was no major congestion in the area. The crew will continue shooting through April 14 at a total of six locations, and is expected to cause a sizable amount of traffic disruption. Traffic will be shut down at the film locations for 11 to 13 hours a day: a 1.8-km stretch of road in Digital Media City from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on April 2-4; the Cheongdam Bridge from 4:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on April 5; the 730 meters of Gangnam Boulevard from 4:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. on April 6 and a road near Kaywon University of Art and Design in Uiwang, Gyeonggi Province, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. “We love this movie, we love your city, and having the two of them together will show the city to the world in a light that I don’t think it’s been shown, certainly not in America,” Joss Whedon, the director and writer of the film, said in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter. He also apologized for the disruption to be caused by shooting what he described as the “exciting action” scenes in the city and describing the opportunity to do so as “a real privilege.” “The Avengers,” which opened in May 2012, earned over $1 billion worldwide and attracted nearly 7 million viewers in Korea alone. “The Age of Ultron” is scheduled to hit theaters in May 2015.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3682269,Actors’ military enlistment may put a brake on K-drama production,2014-03-27,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2014/03/27/20140327001029_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"In South Korea, all able-bodied Korean men 19 or older are obliged to serve in the military for two years. Even the hottest stars like Kim Soo-hyun and Lee Min-ho can’t avoid enlistment. South Korean drama production companies and broadcasters are expected to face obstacles in casting A-list actors as many are preparing to enter military service as early as this year. “The stars who are preparing for military enlistment from this year and next are unexpectedly the most wanted actors for upcoming dramas,” a high-ranking official at a major broadcaster said. Two of those who need to enlist by next year are Yoo Ah-in and Kim Hyun-joong, both 28 years old. According to law, a conscript is only allowed to postpone military service until the age of 29. Hallyu star Yoo Ah-in hinted that jTBC’s “Secret Love Affair,” which started airing on March 17, would be his last TV series before he join the army. “The date of enlistment has not been confirmed yet, but I think ‘Secret Love Affair’ was the best choice to fully immerse into acting as my last drama,” he told reporters at a press conference. Actors who gained popularity across Asian countries such as Lee Min-ho, Lee Seung-gi and Jang Geun-suk, are all at the age when many Korean men start their military service. They boast a broad fan base built on the Korean Wave throughout East and Southeast Asian countries, with hit dramas such as Lee’s “The Heirness” and Jang’s “You’re Beautiful.” Kim Soo-hyun, star of the Smash hit ""My Love from the Star,"" was given a physical checkup by the military recruitment agency in 2012. Obligatory military service is a double edged-sword for Korean actors. As the country remains technically at war with North Korea, the public sentiment regarding draft dodging is highly sensitive. Celebrities, including many actors, dread the military draft, fearing that being away from the media limelight two year would make their career grind to a halt. But at the same time if they come under suspicion of draft dodging, Korean fans tend to abruptly abandon their stars. The showbiz industry takes note of the risk -- losing fans or the reputation of stars -- but it is also concerned about the side effects of mandatory military service. “The export of Korean dramas still relies heavily on big name actors, so it is inevitable that the stars’ breaks will impact exports,” said a source familiar with the issue. With Park Yoo-chun of JYJ, who hasn’t fulfilled his mandatory military service yet, starring in SBS drama “Three Days,” the company exported its copyright at the highest possible price to China. While the exact amount is unknown, it was reported that the TV series earned five times higher than other dramas in the Chinese market, which were offered less than $10,000 per episode. JYJ’s agency C-JeS Entertainment said it would follow the military law despite the negative economic impacts on the firm, and take military duty in consideration when arranging the schedules for the group. By Park Han-na ()",kimsoohyun,4.0,"The article specifically mentions Kim Soo-hyun (김수현) and discusses his military enlistment, which is relevant to his career as an actor. However, the focus is broader, covering the impact of military service on K-drama production and other actors, not solely on Kim Soo-hyun's work as an actor, model, or singer.

Kim Soo-hyun, the male lead in the drama, has become the heartthrob of Chinese girls. In the series, he played Do Min-jun, an alien in the form of a perfect male specimen who falls in love with an arrogant A-list actress played by Jun Ji-hyun. The demigod’s appearance on a Chinese TV program last weekend evoked an explosive response, with illegal tickets sold for up to 30,000 yuan ($4,900), Chinese media reported. It is said Kim took home a whopping 3 million yuan for that appearance. Any Korean products featured on the drama became mega-sellers. After Jun mentioned fried chicken and beer, a combination called “chi-maek” in Korean that many people here love to have on Fridays and during casual evening gatherings, Korean chicken joints in China saw local customers line up for as long as two hours to order. Korean instant noodle maker Nongshim said sales in January and February ― while the drama aired ― rose to a record in its more than 15-year history of business in the country. This, too, is attributed to a scene in the drama where the couple enjoyed a bowl of noodles on a trip. Meshing comedy, suspense, sci-fi and romance, “My Love” aired on SBS TV, one of Korea’s three major TV networks, from Dec. 18, 2013, to Feb. 28, 2014. It was the most-watched program of its time slot, with a rating of 28.1 percent. In China, its episodes saw more than a combined 2.5 billion views online. Though not as popular as “My Love,” some other Korean programs scored big among Chinese viewers in recent months. They include TV drama “The Heirs” and reality show “Where Are We Going, Dad?” The latter was a format sale to China, in which Chinese producers recreated their own show based on the Korean format. “The sale of Korean TV dramas to China has been sluggish for the past few years, compared to its peak years, but there seems to be a new opportunity opening up now which is the format business,” said Yoon Jae-shik, a hallyu researcher at the state-run Korea Creative Content Agency. Be it in the form of an end-product sale or just a format sale, many officials in Korea hope that the series of Korean programs’ successes leads to a resurgence of the Korean Wave, or hallyu, which swept the country in the early 2000s. Hallyu started with a string of successful soap operas, which were followed by movies and pop music. To find ways to create a second hallyu, government officials, culture professionals and academics have been holding forums, policy meetings and other events in past years. Such efforts have doubled under President Park Geun-hye’s drive to nurture creative industries to jump-start economic growth. The success of “My Love” and others may be a sign that their efforts are working. Or it might be just a coincidence. What looks clear is that Korea needs a second or third “My Love” to carry the momentum into the second Korean Wave.

With the hit Korean drama “My Love from the Star” sweeping China, its government is keeping a wary eye on the frenzy the drama has created in the nation. The U.S. daily Washington Post reported Friday that the Chinese government officials discussed the popular Korean drama’s success with envy at the ongoing China‘s National People’s Congress, where the country‘s highest governing bodies meet annually to discuss legislative issues. In a committee of China’s political advisory body (CPPCC), the Korean soap opera reportedly topped the agenda. The delegates from the culture and entertainment industry spent a whole morning lamenting “why China cannot make a show as good and as big of a hit,” the U.S. media outlet said. The popularity of the drama in China is, in fact, more visible than ever. After the show‘s female lead mentioned “beer and fried chicken” in an episode, eating them instantly became a fad among Chinese fans. Korean restaurants in Minhang, the Korean concentrated district of Shanghai, are reaping benefits from the buzz. Since they started selling beer and fried chicken, Chinese customers have flocked to the restaurants even when they have to queue up for tens of minutes. “I frequently buy Korean foods such as beer and fried chicken to eat when watching Korean dramas at home,” a Chinese person told Korean news agency Yonhap News. “My friends and I often talk about Korean dramas and celebrities.” “My Love from the Star” features an alien who arrived in Korea by traveling through time from the Joseon era 400 years ago and ends up falling in love with a modern-day actress. The romantic comedy series has garnered more than 2.5 billion views online and achieved the country’s highest viewership. Kim Soo-hyun, the male lead in the show, also captured hearts in China with the drama’s soaring popularity. Kim, who recently appeared on Chinese variety show “Super Brain,” reportedly arrived on a chartered plane hired for him by the Chinese broadcaster. According to Chinese news reports, the price of the show‘s admission tickets skyrocketed to as much as $5,000. Many government officials in China view the explosive popularity of the Korean drama as a heavy blow to Chinese confidence in their culture. “It is more than just a Korean soap opera. It hurts our culture dignity,” the Washington Post quoted a CPPCC member as saying. But more than the cultural dignity is at stake. The bitterness about the Korean drama’s success is linked with the regional rivalries, according to the U.S. daily.

[1] The Korean Wave is again sweeping across China, with many Chinese women worshipping South Korean actors Kim Soo-hyun and Lee Min-ho as demigods. Chinese netizens have always been divided over South Korean TV dramas, but there is no doubt that programs from the neighboring country are now enjoying a new round of popularity in China. And a big part of the credit for that goes to “You who Came from the Star,” the South Korean TV series which is on the air now.  sweep: 휩쓸다  worship: 신봉하다  demigod: 반신반인  credit: 신용 [2] Top South Korean actors Jun Ji-hyun and Kim Soo-hyun recently earned a popularity rating of 24.8 percent in their country, considered strong by Nielsen Korea. “You who Came from the Star” and “The Heirs” have been subjects of hot online discussions throughout Asia. Besides, the book “The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane,” read by the hero in “You who Came from the Star,” was a hard-to-get item on Amazon for a while. [3] The two TV programs have several common elements: a tall, handsome, and rich hero who loves the heroine blindly and always protects her, and an equally handsome man madly in love with the same woman. Both programs portray the purity of love, which is expressed through a kiss or a warm hug. Perhaps that’s the secret of their success; perhaps people are still fascinated by Cinderella-type stories. hero: 영웅, 주인공(heroin: 여자의 경우) [4] The widening wealth gap is a matter of social concern both in South Korea and China, and the challenges that young people face in their quest for a better life might have prompted many ordinary girls to dream of marrying rich, caring men. This is precisely what the popular South Korean TV dramas portray. In fact, South Korean TV dramas are tailored to meet the market’s demands. wealth gap: 빈부격차  quest: 추구   prompt: 야기하다, 초래하다  tailor: 기획, 제작하다 [5] In contrast, Chinese TV schedules are flooded with knock-offs and poorly made soap operas. Most of the Chinese TV dramas either distort the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression or blindly copy foreign programs. The lack of good stories has of late resulted in loads of TV series on time travel or fights in the harems of Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) emperors. These, in short, are the bane of Chinese TV productions.  be flooded with: 홍수, 넘치다   knock-off: 가짜 모조   the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression: 중일전쟁  in short: 간단히 말하자면  harem: 첩 (royal harem: 후궁)  bane: 골칫거리 [6] In contrast, South Korean TV dramas have reinvented themselves. In fact, 2013 could be said to be the year of the rebirth of South Korean TV dramas. Shortly after the enormous craze generated by “Daejanggeum (Jewel in the Palace)” in 2003, South Korean dramas lost much of their popularity in other Asian countries thanks partly to better produced programs from the United States and the United Kingdom.  reinvent: 재창조하다   craze: 열풍, 대유행 [7] Many netizens even said at the time that South Korean TV dramas had become passe because of their stereotyped plot features: traffic accidents, cancer and other incurable diseases. But all that has changed with the success of “You who Came from the Star” and “The Heirs,” which Chinese directors can use as examples, as well as inspiration, to improve their productions.  passé: 구식의 유행이 지난   stereotype: 고정관념, 정형화된 이미지 생각  incurable: 고칠 수 없는, 불치의 [8] The resurgence of South Korean TV dramas can be attributed to the joint efforts of the country’s government and TV series makers. The South Korean government implemented a policy to help TV productions in the late 1990s, when the first wave of popular dramas emerged from the country to capture the imagination of the people in the rest of Asia. Just before the turn of the millennium, the South Korean government issued regulations saying at least 80 percent of the TV programs had to be domestically produced. It also fixed the minimum number of domestic TV series to be broadcast in the country. That not only helped South Korean TV productions gain a firm foothold in the domestic market, but also laid the foundation for their successful foray into overseas markets.  resurgence: 재기, 부활   attribute sth to sth: ~을 ~의 결과로 보다   implement: 시행하다  capture: 잡다, 차지하다  issue: 발표하다   fix: 고정시키다   foothold: 발판   foray: 시도, 진출  기사전문: http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20140304000914 팟캐스트: https://itunes.apple.com/kr/podcast/koliaheleoldeu-paskaeseuteu/id686406253?mt=2 팟빵: http://www.podbbang.com/ch/6638",kimsoohyun,5.0,"The article specifically mentions Kim Soo-hyun (김수현) multiple times, highlighting his role in the popular drama ""You Who Came from the Star"" and his immense popularity in China and South Korea.

Top South Korean actors Jun Ji-hyun and Kim Soo-hyun recently earned a popularity rating of 24.8 percent in their country, considered strong by Nielsen Korea. “You who Came from the Star” and “The Heirs” have been subjects of hot online discussions throughout Asia. Besides, the book “The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane,” read by the hero in “You who Came from the Star,” was a hard-to-get item on Amazon for a while.  The two TV programs have several common elements: a tall, handsome, and rich hero who loves the heroine blindly and always protects her, and an equally handsome man madly in love with the same woman. Both programs portray the purity of love, which is expressed through a kiss or a warm hug. Perhaps that’s the secret of their success; perhaps people are still fascinated by Cinderella-type stories. The widening wealth gap is a matter of social concern both in South Korea and China, and the challenges that young people face in their quest for a better life might have prompted many ordinary girls to dream of marrying rich, caring men. This is precisely what the popular South Korean TV dramas portray. In fact, South Korean TV dramas are tailored to meet the market’s demands. In contrast, Chinese TV schedules are flooded with knock-offs and poorly made soap operas. Most of the Chinese TV dramas either distort the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression or blindly copy foreign programs. The lack of good stories has of late resulted in loads of TV series on time travel or fights in the harems of Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) emperors. These, in short, are the bane of Chinese TV productions. In contrast, South Korean TV dramas have reinvented themselves. In fact, 2013 could be said to be the year of the rebirth of South Korean TV dramas. Shortly after the enormous craze generated by “Daejanggeum (Jewel in the Palace)” in 2003, South Korean dramas lost much of their popularity in other Asian countries thanks partly to better produced programs from the United States and the United Kingdom. Many netizens even said at the time that South Korean TV dramas had become passe because of their stereotyped plot features: traffic accidents, cancer and other incurable diseases. But all that has changed with the success of “You who Came from the Star” and “The Heirs,” which Chinese directors can use as examples, as well as inspiration, to improve their productions. The resurgence of South Korean TV dramas can be attributed to the joint efforts of the country’s government and TV series makers. The South Korean government implemented a policy to help TV productions in the late 1990s, when the first wave of popular dramas emerged from the country to capture the imagination of the people in the rest of Asia. Just before the turn of the millennium, the South Korean government issued regulations saying at least 80 percent of the TV programs had to be domestically produced. It also fixed the minimum number of domestic TV series to be broadcast in the country. That not only helped South Korean TV productions gain a firm foothold in the domestic market, but also laid the foundation for their successful foray into overseas markets. Recent years have seen great innovations in South Korean TV productions in terms of themes and narrative patterns. Take “You who Came from the Star” as an example. Although aliens visiting Earth is an oft-used theme, the script of “You who Came from the Star” remains logical and fast-paced. It mixes the plot with romance and murder and keeps the audience guessing about how the story will unfold. When it comes to love stories, the new South Korean teleplays no longer use the distress card; instead, they intersperse them with whimsy and romantic punch lines. The three TV stations, SBS, KBS and MBC, control the majority of South Korean TV market, each specializing in a different area and catering to people of different ages. The productions are sleek and use advanced technologies such as high-speed photography and computer-generated effects, creating a real-life visual impact. Moreover, the shooting for South Korean productions generally starts when the scripts are just one-third ready. Many popular productions have their own websites, where scriptwriters post part of the finished scripts, inviting viewers to leave messages, discuss the plot and come up with suggestions for future episodes. This not only keeps viewers’ interest in the TV dramas alive, but also helps scriptwriters and directors make changes to the storylines to suit the audience’s demand. Hopefully, the innovation-induced success of South Korean TV programs will prompt Chinese TV drama makers to think up new ideas and abandon their bad practice of copying foreign productions in order to attract more viewers at home, and possibly abroad.

Running in prime time on commercial station SBS TV since December, “You Who Came From the Star” is about an alien from outer space who falls in love with a top actress. In an op-ed piece published by the China Daily, writer Xiao Lixin attributed the Korean drama’s success in China to “great innovations in South Korean TV productions in terms of themes and narrative patterns.” “Take ‘You Who Came From the Star’ as an example.

Kim Soo-hyun, in particular, hero of the hit drama “Man from the Stars,” is gaining explosive popularity in China, topping the “Today’s Actor” chart on China’s largest search engine Baidu on Jan. 14.  “Kim Soo-hyun is handsome, and many girls would want to approach him,” said Connie Pang, 33, a big fan of Korean dramas who lives in Hong Kong. The 27-year-old heartthrob has been well-regarded for his acting, too. “Kim Soo-hyun is one of the rare 20-something actors who retain outstanding acting skills,” Jang Tae-yoo, the producer of “Man From the Stars” was quoted as saying. Kim is not the only star who dazzles China, however. Lee Min-ho from the popular drama “The Heirs” has also enjoyed soaring popularity, outshining rivals so far in the poll for the “2013 most influential Korean star in China,” being conducted by Chinese People’s Daily. Pang said the Korean male stars’ popularity is mainly due to their appearance: “In general, Chinese people think that Korean stars have a handsome face and good body shape.” Lee Ho-gyu, a professor at Nam Seoul Art College, pointed out that Chinese and Korean drama-watchers are more sensitive to fast-changing trends. “Japanese fans fall for stars’ characters in dramas while Chinese and Korean fans fall for stars’ appearance and style.” Kim has continued to boost his standing in China with the soaring popularity of the SBS drama “Man from the Stars.” In the drama, he plays an alien who has arrived in Korea by travelling through time from the Joseon Era and ends up falling in love with a modern-day actress, played by Jun Ji-hyun (Giana Jun). The romantic comedy series has already cleared the 20-percent mark in terms of viewership at home in just four episodes. The popular drama has become a sensation in China as well. “When the cast of the drama was announced, it drew attention from Chinese fans and a number of Chinese content providers,” said an official of HB entertainment in charge of producing the drama “Man From the Stars” Even before the drama aired in Korea, the production team received a flood of requests for broadcasting rights from Chinese companies. “The three main content providers in China -- PPS, IQIYI and KanKan -- are helping the Chinese viewers to catch up with the latest episodes in real time,” she told the Korea Herald. The latest episode of “Man From the Stars” is available on Chinese websites providing downloadable content to those who pay within a few hours after an episode airs in Korea. So far, there have been more than 1.7 billion downloads of the 10 episodes available online, according to HB entertainment. To lure viewers, drama plots are carefully designed and structured in the early stage of production. Writers and the producer carry out extensive research together to create storylines that will appeal to the drama’s fans at home and abroad. In some cases, they seek advice from professionals with in-depth knowledge about China to take into account Chinese interests before writing a plot. The easy access to Korean dramas through the Internet, coupled with the production teams’ efforts to create high-quality content, has paved the way for the stars to boost their profiles in China, Professor Lee pointed out. The Internet and social networking services have served as catalysts for the Korean culture boom in Asia. Korean stars can now instantly and continuously communicate with overseas fans through SNS, which has helped them expand their fandom abroad. “Without the Internet, the Korean wave would have been impossible,” Professor Lee said. In fact, as many as 740,000 fans are following Kim on Weibo, known as the Chinese Twitter, and the number of members of online fan sites surpassed 1 million as of Sunday, according to his agency, KeyEast. However, nobody can foresee how long the star will remain popular in China. In the fast-changing media environment, a number of budding stars are introduced to TV fans every day. Chinese fans’ attention might quickly move on to other stars. “These days, a star can be easily replaced,” the professor noted. For Korean stars to secure their status and enjoy long-lasting popularity in China, Professor Lee advised them to engage in local activities by collaborating with Chinese celebrities in concerts, dramas and films. “The stars should sympathize and communicate more with Chinese fans in various ways.” By Ock Hyun-ju, Intern reporter ()",kimsoohyun,5.0,"The article specifically mentions Kim Soo-hyun (김수현) and focuses on his popularity in China due to his role in the hit drama ""Man from the Stars,"" highlighting his acting skills and appeal as a male actor.

Although no legal action has been taken by either party, the issue of plagiarism has been a long-standing hot-button issue in the Korean entertainment industry, by both the accusers and the accused. Although many people take it upon personal instinct whether to judge an idea or concept as having been the victim of intellectual theft, the harsh reality is that it’s almost impossible to define, let alone prove, plagiarism. In the past, many popular Korean dramas have come under fire of plagiarism accusations such as “Secret Garden,” “Five Fingers,” “Greatest Love,” “Queen Sun Deok” and even the megahit 2009 spy drama “Iris,” starring Lee Byung-hun and Kim Tae-hee. In 2009, novelist Park Chul-joo first filed a suit against Taewon Entertainment ― the production company of KBS TV drama “Iris” ― claiming the plot of the drama had copied scenes from his novel. However, after deliberation, the Seoul Central District Court sided with Taewon Entertainment, claiming that although some of the scenes were similar, it was not “similar enough” to be considered plagiarism. A year later, another writer ― referred to only as Mr. Lee ― filed another lawsuit against the drama’s producers, claiming that some of the storyline had been plagiarized from one of his novels, infringing on the text’s copyright. However, after years of fighting, the courts eventually dismissed that lawsuit in August, stating that the scenes the producers of “Iris” were accused of plagiarizing were in fact “abstract ideas,” which are not afforded protection of copyright laws. “When it comes to plagiarism in a legal sense, there are just too many blurred lines,” said pop culture critic Jung Duk-hyun. “There is so much cultural content being put out into the public nowadays, the overlapping of ideas is just inevitable. “These genres all have a certain formula, like the storyline about a man falling in love with a woman … we’ve all seen it so much we’ve gone numb,” he continued. In the case of “My Love from the Star,” the critic claimed that the fact that the storyline is based on the historic findings surrounding the “Gwanghae Journal” just makes it all that more difficult to definitively state that the TV drama indeed plagiarized Kang’s comic book series.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/27944,Gianna Jun proves aging is good,2013-12-17,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2013/12/17/20131217000456_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Actress to return to small screen with Kim Soo-hyun on ‘My Love from the Star' With her long, lean legs, velvety hair, and sassy image, Jun Ji-hyun ― known as Gianna Jun in the U.S. and China ― has remained at the top of Korea’s entertainment scene for more than a decade. Ever since playing the protagonist in the smash-hit movie “My Sassy Girl” in 2001, Jun has been one of few actresses who can boast longevity through a handful of films and heaps of TV commercials. For a long time, she topped the surveys of men’s favorite actresses and, moreover, represented a new generation of Korean femininity ― pretty, outspoken and confident. On Wednesday the 32-year-old actress makes a return to the small screen after 14 years away. In “My Love from the Star” scheduled to air at 10 p.m. on Wednesdays and Thursdays on SBS, Jun portrays Cheon Song-ee, a top actress who doesn’t really know life outside of showbiz. After a string of scandals break out that drag her down to the status of a nobody, she falls in love with an “alien” ― played by Kim Soo-hyun ― who has lived in Korea for more than 400 years. Alongside Jun and Kim, a number of up-and-coming actors are co-starring in the drama, including Park Hae-jin as an avid admirer of Song-ee; Yoo In-na as Song-ee’s friend and nemesis; and Shin Sung-rok as a cold-blooded businessman. Unlike her last TV drama appearance on “Happy Together,” where she was the youngest of the bunch and relied on household-name actors such as Song Seung-hun and Lee Byung-hun, this time, Jun is the eldest of the leading actors. Kim, Yoo and Park all expressed their excitement in working with Jun, their senior. At the press conference Monday marking the launch of the drama, Jun showed off her maturity, and that she had more than a pretty face and a pin-up figure. After hitting recent box office home runs with “Berlin File” and “The Thieves,” she looked more laid back and confident than ever. “Aging definitely brought me to where I am. As I entered my 30s I began to think about what other people do ― get married, think about my career in a long term … those are what I have done, too,” said Jun, who married a banker last year. “I have come to acknowledge that I am a grown-up and that I need to go slow at this point and speed up at that. Thanks to the films’ success, I have the opportunity to focus on what I have chosen,” she said. Jun’s character of Song-ee ― the “star of Asia” ― is bold, blunt, and sometimes overly confident in situations that could easily make her look dumb. She drinks like a fish, swears like a sailor and does whatever she wants, including drunkenly pounding on other people’s doors in the middle of the night. This reminds viewers a lot of Jun’s character in “My Sassy Girl.” Jun would have refuted such claims in the past, but now she seems unperturbed. “Well, all the characters I have played come out from me and it is natural that they reflect pieces of me. I am not the kind of person who has multiple personas. It is natural that you may think that they look alike in a way,” Jun said. “But with the lines (written by star writer Park Ji-eun of ‘My Husband Got a Family’) and the environment (directed by Jang Tae-yoo of ‘Deep Rooted Tree’ and ‘Painter of the Wind’), I am sure I will be playing Cheon Song-ee effectively,” she said. Jun shared the spotlight with actor Kim, who rose to stardom after appearing on the MBC TV drama, “Moon Embracing the Sun” last year as a handsome and romantic king. Kim played Jun’s sort-of love interest in the movie “The Thieves.” “I have to admit that one of the main attractions of the drama was working with Jun,” Kim said. “On set, she really sets the atmosphere and she knows what to do. It really helps.” “Jun was the first person on the list for the Cheon character. But we all thought, ‘Hey, would Jun really take it?’ When she did, we couldn’t believe it. It was a true dream come true,” director Jang said. “It will be the best rom-com ever!” By Bae Ji-sook ()",kimsoohyun,4.0,"The article specifically mentions Kim Soo-hyun (김수현) as a co-star in the drama ""My Love from the Star,"" highlighting his role as an actor.

Local films exceeded the 100 million-viewer mark for the first time in November 2012. The milestone meant Koreans saw at least two local films on average last year. A new box office record is about to be set, beating last year’s performance by almost three months.   In the month of August alone ― from Aug. 1 to 25 ― Korean films drew 24.36 million viewers to local theaters. A number of hit films contributed to this month’s box office success, including Bong Joon-ho’s blockbuster “Snowpiercer.” The dystopian sci-fi flick, starring Tilda Swinton and Ed Harris, has drawn 8.8 million viewers since its release on Aug. 1. Emerging director Kim Byung-woo’s disaster thriller “The Terror Live,” starring Ha Jung-woo, has drawn 5.4 million viewers. Meanwhile, “Hide and Seek,” another thriller also directed by rookie filmmaker Huh Jung, has attracted 4.07 million. “The Flu,” a pandemic thriller by Kim Seong-soo, was seen by 2.7 million. The market share of locally produced films this month reached 78.4 percent. The 24.36 million-viewer record beats the one set in February, which stood at 18.09 million viewers with the popularity of Ryu Seung-wan’s star-studded North Korean spy flick “The Berlin File” and tearjerker drama “Miracle in Cell No. 7.” The number of domestic film releases has been increasing as well in the past four years. In 2009, a total of 118 Korean films were released, 140 in 2010, 150 in 2011 and 175 in 2012. As of August, a total of 98 local movies have hit theaters so far this year. The Korean movie industry also enjoyed significant success away from the box office last year. Director Kim Ki-duk won the Golden Lion Award for his bleak morality tale “Pieta” at the Venice Film Festival, becoming the first Korean filmmaker to win the honor. Domestic films’ market share hit 59 percent as well, up 7 percentage points from the previous year. This year’s local movie lineup included movies by the country’s most prominent directors, including Park Chan-wook, Kim Jee-woon and Bong Joon-ho. Park and Kim made their Hollywood debuts this year, Park with the psychological thriller “Stoker” and Kim with the action flick “The Last Stand.” Bong’s “Snowpiercer,” co-produced by Korea’s CJ Entertainment and Park Chan-wook among others, is the most expensive film in Korean movie history. Korean films, both commercial and independent, were also diverse in genres and style, appealing to a wide spectrum of viewers. Jang Cheol-soo’s hit film “Secretly Greatly,” for one, was based on the popular 2010 webtoon series “Convertness” by artist HUN. The film, starring national heartthrob Kim Soo-hyun as an attractive North Korean spy disguised as an intellectually disabled person in South Korea, was especially popular among the young viewers. Another hit film “Cold Eyes” was about a group of detectives specializing in surveillance of high profile criminals. Independent movie “Pluto,” which critically deals with Korea’s competition-oriented education system, also received positive reviews from the audience and the press. Rookie directors Huh Jung and Kim Byung-woo also produced unexpected hits with their highly successful thrillers “Hide and Seek” and “The Terror Live.” “The number of movie theaters did not increase much compared to the year before, so it’s not the venues,” said Kim Young-gi from the Korean Film Council. “So I’d have to say the box office success of domestic movies really has to do with their substance and quality. I think a lot of great, quality movies came out this year and the audience took notice of them.” The local press and industry insiders predict that the films could even reach the 200 million mark by the end of this year, as a number of highly anticipated films are still to be released, including “The Spy” which co-stars Sol Kyung-gu, Moon So-ri and Daniel Henney, and “The Face Reader” which stars some of the country’s biggest stars including Kim Hye-soo, Lee Jung-jae and Song Kang-ho.

(코리아 헤럴드/ 진은수 인턴기자) <관련 영문 기사> 10 hottest celebrities in South Korea today  Sorting out a list of top celebrities is relatively easy for ardent Korean Wave fans who keep tabs on their favorite stars. For non-experts, not many lists offer a guide into who is winning the most hearts in South Korea. Here is The Korea Herald’s list of the hottest celebrities out there. Female 1. Bae Suzy  Bae Suzy, better known by her stage name Suzy, debuted as a member of JYP Entertainment’s girl group Miss A in the summer of 2010. The 20-year-old singer-actress is one of the most talked-about celebrities in South Korea, charming fans with her glamorous image that has won her roles in many TV commercials. Although she debuted as a main vocal of a girl group, she nailed the country’s “first love” image with her role in the movie “Architecture 101” in which she co-starred with Lee Jae-hoon. Other drama series such as KBS2 TV’s “Dream High” and “Big” also helped her rise to stardom. 2. Kang Min-kyung The 23-year-old singer is a member of a K-pop girl duo Davichi, which debuted in 2008. Even before her official debut, Kang was already going viral among Internet users with her pretty face and unique fashion sense. After extensive vocal training, she successfully made her way to professional singing. Fans say her mature and deep voice in contrast with her feminine look is one of her prominent charming points. Aside from her vocal career, the singer also made her first small-screen appearance in 2011, playing a role on SBS’ TV series “Smile Mom.”   Davichi released a digital single “Melting” in April, an R&B-based hip-hop track featuring Verbal Jint. 3. Go Jun-hee  The career of Go Jun-hee, 28, has reached a new high this year. After debuting in 2011 as a model for a school uniform brand, she has recently taken over the screen, doing more than 10 commercials in 2013 alone. Go has recently taken the honor of being a poster girl for Korea’s biggest-selling liquor, “Cheoumcheorum” soju. The brand is known for recruiting the nation‘s hottest actresses. After appearing as a supporting role in several mainstream movies such as “Architecture 101” and “Girls Scout” in 2011, she made her way to TV dramas. She performed in “Can You Hear My Heart?” in 2011 and “King of Ambition” in 2013. Go joined the fourth season of dating reality show “We Got Married” with Jung Jin-woon, a member of the hallyu boy band 2AM. 4. Son Yeon-jae  Youngest among the enlisted celebrities, Son is a rhythmic gymnast not only winning the hearts of Korean fans, but also those around the world. The 20-year-old gymnast is the 2010 Asian Games bronze medalist and three-time gold medalist at the Asian Championships in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Son’s slender figure and lovely face enchanted the country’s TV commercial industry and she has made appearances in ads for various products ranging from air conditioners to sportswear brands. Son is often compared to Kim Yu-na as she is another sports beauty who performs strongly in international competitions. 5. Park Shin-hye  Model-actress Park Shin-hye’s first appearance on TV involved Korea’s famous rocker Lee Seung-hwan’s music video “Flower.” She debuted in the TV drama genre with the child role of Choi Ji-woo on “Stairway to Heaven” in 2003. Park gained fame through TV drama series, notably with “Tree of Heaven” in 2005 and “You’re Beautiful” in 2009. Park starred in the cable drama “Flower Boys Next Door” with Yoo Si-yoon and the box-office hit “Miracle in Cell No. 7” which helped her rise to stardom. Male 1. Kim Soo-hyun  Debuting in 2007 through the MBC TV sitcom “Kimchi Cheese Smile,” the 26-year-old actor had not gotten much spotlight after that although he has appeared in more than five movies and TV series as supporting roles since then. In 2012, Kim hit the jackpot with MBC historical drama “Moon Embracing the Sun,” where he left a strong impression on many female viewers in and outside of Korea with his role as a fictional king of the Joseon Dynasty. Recently, the heartthrob starred in “Secretly Greatly,” a movie about a North Korean spy. 2. Lee Jin-wook  Actor Lee Jin-wook made his debut in 2003 as a model for Panasonic. Since then, he has built up his acting career through TV series such as KBS2 drama “Resurrection” in 2005, and cable TV OCN’s “Someday” in 2006. Despite his model-like figure and handsome looks, the actor did not get much attention until he revealed his relationship with hallyu star Choi Ji-woo, whom he met through the MBC TV drama “Air City” in 2007. However, the couple broke up in 2011. He then played the role of on-and-off boyfriend in tvN series “I Need Romance 2012,” one of the most successful cable dramas that year. Lee continued on to his latest role in fantasy melodrama “Nine,” on the same station. “Nine” was considered a turning point in his acting career since the drama has become a hit. 3. Lee Soo-hyuk  Lee Soo-hyuk, whose birth name is Lee Hyuk-soo, is a model-actor who debuted as a professional model in 2006 for designer Jung Wook-jun’s fashion show. The 26-year-old model walked down the runway of the nation’s famous fashion brands including General Idea and Song Zio, and managed to do cover shoots with several renowned fashion magazines such as GQ, Bazaar and Elle. Lee expanded his career into acting, doing several TV series and movies including “Deep Rooted Tree” in 2011 and “The Boy from Ipanema” in 2010.   Lee is certainly not the type that falls into the category of “handsome guy.” However, his skinny figure and white skin have charmed the public. His recent drama “Shark” is shedding light on his future career as a promising actor. 4. Lee Je-hoon  The actor started his career in 2007 at a relatively late age of 23 through a short film “They Live By Night.” Ever since, he has appeared in more than 18 short films including a gay romance film “Just Friends?” directed by Kim Zho, who has recently tied the knot with his boyfriend. In 2011, he featured in an indie movie “Bleak Night” in a role that gave him the honor of sweeping the “Best New Actor” award at movie festivals including the Blue Dragon Film Awards. Another box-office hit that cannot be left out is a 2012 movie “Architecture 101,” where he played a shy college boy pining for his first love.

For non-experts, not many lists offer a guide into who is winning the most hearts in South Korea. Here is The Korea Herald’s list of the hottest celebrities out there. Female 1. Bae Suzy  Bae Suzy, better known by her stage name Suzy, debuted as a member of JYP Entertainment’s girl group Miss A in the summer of 2010. The 20-year-old singer-actress is one of the most talked-about celebrities in South Korea, charming fans with her glamorous image that has won her roles in many TV commercials. Although she debuted as a main vocal of a girl group, she nailed the country’s “first love” image with her role in the movie “Architecture 101” in which she co-starred with Lee Jae-hoon. Other drama series such as KBS2 TV’s “Dream High” and “Big” also helped her rise to stardom. 2. Kang Min-kyung The 23-year-old singer is a member of a K-pop girl duo Davichi, which debuted in 2008. Even before her official debut, Kang was already going viral among Internet users with her pretty face and unique fashion sense. After extensive vocal training, she successfully made her way to professional singing. Fans say her mature and deep voice in contrast with her feminine look is one of her prominent charming points. Aside from her vocal career, the singer also made her first small-screen appearance in 2011, playing a role on SBS’ TV series “Smile Mom.” Davichi released a digital single “Melting” in April, an R&B-based hip-hop track featuring Verbal Jint.    3. Go Jun-hee The career of Go Jun-hee, 28, has reached a new high this year. After debuting in 2011 as a model for a school uniform brand, she has recently taken over the screen, doing more than 10 commercials in 2013 alone. Go has recently taken the honor of being a poster girl for Korea’s biggest-selling liquor, “Cheoumcheorum” soju. The brand is known for recruiting the nation‘s hottest actresses. After appearing as a supporting role in several mainstream movies such as “Architecture 101” and “Girls Scout” in 2011, she made her way to TV dramas. She performed in “Can You Hear My Heart?” in 2011 and “King of Ambition” in 2013. Go joined the fourth season of dating reality show “We Got Married” with Jung Jin-woon, a member of the hallyu boy band 2AM. 4. Son Yeon-jae  Youngest among the enlisted celebrities, Son is a rhythmic gymnast not only winning the hearts of Korean fans, but also those around the world. The 20-year-old gymnast is the 2010 Asian Games bronze medalist and three-time gold medalist at the Asian Championships in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Son’s slender figure and lovely face enchanted the country’s TV commercial industry and she has made appearances in ads for various products ranging from air conditioners to sportswear brands. Son is often compared to Kim Yu-na as she is another sports beauty who performs strongly in international competitions. 5. Park Shin-hye  Model-actress Park Shin-hye’s first appearance on TV involved Korea’s famous rocker Lee Seung-hwan’s music video “Flower.” She debuted in the TV drama genre with the child role of Choi Ji-woo on “Stairway to Heaven” in 2003. Park gained fame through TV drama series, notably with “Tree of Heaven” in 2005 and “You’re Beautiful” in 2009. Park starred in the cable drama “Flower Boys Next Door” with Yoo Si-yoon and the box-office hit “Miracle in Cell No. 7” which helped her rise to stardom. Male 1. Kim Soo-hyun  Debuting in 2007 through the MBC TV sitcom “Kimchi Cheese Smile,” the 26-year-old actor had not gotten much spotlight after that although he has appeared in more than five movies and TV series as supporting roles since then. In 2012, Kim hit the jackpot with MBC historical drama “Moon Embracing the Sun,” where he left a strong impression on many female viewers in and outside of Korea with his role as a fictional king of the Joseon Dynasty. Recently, the heartthrob starred in “Secretly Greatly,” a movie about a North Korean spy. 2. Lee Jin-wook  Actor Lee Jin-wook made his debut in 2003 as a model for Panasonic. Since then, he has built up his acting career through TV series such as KBS2 drama “Resurrection” in 2005, and cable TV OCN’s “Someday” in 2006. Despite his model-like figure and handsome looks, the actor did not get much attention until he revealed his relationship with hallyu star Choi Ji-woo, whom he met through the MBC TV drama “Air City” in 2007. However, the couple broke up in 2011. He then played the role of on-and-off boyfriend in tvN series “I Need Romance 2012,” one of the most successful cable dramas that year. Lee continued on to his latest role in fantasy melodrama “Nine,” on the same station. “Nine” was considered a turning point in his acting career since the drama has become a hit. 3. Lee Soo-hyuk Lee Soo-hyuk, whose birth name is Lee Hyuk-soo, is a model-actor who debuted as a professional model in 2006 for designer Jung Wook-jun’s fashion show. The 26-year-old model walked down the runway of the nation’s famous fashion brands including General Idea and Song Zio, and managed to do cover shoots with several renowned fashion magazines such as GQ, Bazaar and Elle. Lee expanded his career into acting, doing several TV series and movies including “Deep Rooted Tree” in 2011 and “The Boy from Ipanema” in 2010.   Lee is certainly not the type that falls into the category of “handsome guy.” However, his skinny figure and white skin have charmed the public.   His recent drama “Shark” is shedding light on his future career as a promising actor.    4. Lee Je-hoon  The actor started his career in 2007 at a relatively late age of 23 through a short film “They Live By Night.” Ever since, he has appeared in more than 18 short films including a gay romance film “Just Friends?” directed by Kim Zho, who has recently tied the knot with his boyfriend. In 2011, he featured in an indie movie “Bleak Night” in a role that gave him the honor of sweeping the “Best New Actor” award at movie festivals including the Blue Dragon Film Awards. Another box-office hit that cannot be left out is a 2012 movie “Architecture 101,” where he played a shy college boy pining for his first love. Gaining public fame through the film, he starred in a comedy-drama “My Paparotti” with Korea’s veteran actor Han Suk-kyu. Lee has not appeared on-screen since October 2012, due to mandatory military service.    5. Song Joong-ki  Born in 1985, Song is known for his good educational background.

But what’s more burdensome than the physical challenge was the pressure he felt. “It was big pressure for me to choose the next film after having received so much love from ‘Moon Embracing the Sun.’ I started to become a coward and was afraid of going outside,” Kim said. “Then I realized something was wrong and realized that I was being overly conscious of other people and that nobody actually cares that much about me,” he said.

The basic idea is that these celebrities are so talented at chowing down that it prompts viewers to want to dig in, too.  Take MBC’s “Where Are We Going, Dad” star Yoon Hoo for instance. The son of costar Yoon Min-soo catapulted to “meokbang” fame when he started scarfing down food in the popular reality variety segment featuring dads and their sons. Now, type in his name with “meokbang” on the Internet and a bunch of blog, photo and video nods pop up ― clearly this is a hot term. So, why are people into “meokbang”? “Eating on-screen is popular because a wide range of viewers can relate to the concept and because it is soothing to watch,” said food cable channel Olive team head Seo Won-yea, 36, in a phone interview with The Korea Herald. Also noteworthy is that not only are viewers zoning in on how people eat on television, there are more and more shows that focus on food in general. As Seo pointed out, KBS’ “Happy Together” recently revamped its set-up by adding a nighttime snack cooking competition to the show. Furthermore, cable food channel Olive first launched in 2011, a mere two years ago. According to Seo, “Watching people make food, seeing delicious food on-screen, heals, is a pleasure to watch and has a positive effect on viewers.” With the launch of Olive came food programs featuring male chefs and male celebrities. This year, actor Seo Tai-hwa began hosting his own eponymous cooking show, where he invites guests and chats while he prepares noodle-based dishes for them. Of “Seo Tai-hwa’s Noodle Shop,” Olive’s Seo said it is “a well-received program because it highlights the relationships fostered by cooking.” “The program attracts male viewers in their 40s,” Seo said. This Wednesday, a new food show featuring “Master Chef Korea Celebrity” winner Son Ho-young started airing on Olive. “We also have a program featuring a male chef and a male celebrity slated to start airing in the end of May or early June,” added Seo. “Now society accepts and admires a man who can cook.” It seems this change in perception is seeping into various aspects of television, including ads, according to Seo. “These days a lot of food brand models are male celebrities like Ko Soo and Kim Soo-hyun,” said Seo. Indeed, male celebrities are popping up in television ads for everything from rice cookers to gochujang (red chili pepper paste) to bread. Seo believes that these sorts of advertisements help foster the fantasy of “a man who cooks for his family or his girlfriend.” In short, the rise of the man who can cook on television seems to be partly fueled by the current trend towards eating on-screen, by society’s positive attitude towards it and by its appeal to viewers.

As of Tuesday, the movie featuring a star-studded cast set a box office record for Korean films by drawing in 13,020,393 movie goers to the theaters, stealing the top spot from director Bong Joon-ho’s 2006 sci-fi thriller “The Host.”
Official box office figures showed that the movie has earned approximately 93.6 billion won ($84 million), surpassing the previous admissions leader “The Host,” which earned about 78.5 billion won.
The film’s domestic success and strong box office numbers have received widespread international attention as well. “The Thieves,” set in Macau, was released on 32 screens in Hong Kong last month, making it the second-largest Hong Kong release for a Korean film following “Haeundae,” which was released on 36 screens.
The distribution rights to the film were sold all over Asia including Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, Taiwan, China, Thailand and Vietnam. The movie also premiered in North America at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival.
“The Thieves” is an action-packed heist film about a team of Korean and Chinese thieves plotting to steal the “Tear of the Sun,” a $20 million diamond necklace that is kept guarded in a casino safe in Macau. It features some of Korea’s top actors and actresses such as Kim Yoon-seok, Kim Hye-soo, Kim Soo-hyun, Giana Jun and many others.
James Cameron’s Hollywood blockbuster “Avatar,” which attracted 13.6 million locals, still sits at the top in the country’s all-time box office sales that include non-domestic films.

Now, Choi’s biggest commercial hit ― the sixth domestic film to top 10 million viewers in Korean movie history at 10,095,387 viewers in 22 days ― is going overseas, slated to open in theaters in Hong Kong, Thailand and Indonesia next month. It will also be released in Singapore and Malaysia later this year.
The film, featuring top stars including Kim Hye-soo, Jun Ji-hyun, Kim Soo-hyun and Hong Kong-based actor Simon Yam, topped the local box office chart on its opening day, beating Christopher Nolan’s Hollywood blockbuster “The Dark Knight Rises.”
Director Choi Dong-hun (Park Hae-mook/The Korea Herald)
“The Thieves” is Choi’s fourth feature-length film, and features a group of 10 professional thieves who get together to steal a diamond worth $20 million in Macau. The film has been recognized for its character development and engaging plot, as well as stunts and wire action.
All three of Choi’s previous works ― “The Big Swindle” (2004) “Tazza: The High Rollers” (2006) “Jeon Woo Chi” (2009) ― also did well in the box office, giving him the reputation of one of the most commercially successful writer-directors today. The Korean Academy of Film Arts graduate and former assistant director to “The Taste of Money” and “The Housemaid” auteur Im Sang-soo has been crafting his own brand of crime and heist thrillers over the years.
Actress Kim Hye-soo, who starred in “The Thieves” as well as Choi’s 2006 flick “Tazza: The High Rollers,” described him as “a genius who also works extremely hard.”
“When I first read the script of the movie, I was just in awe,” she told The Korea Herald last month. “It was a product of great effort, genius ideas and a detail-oriented, calculative mind. I think he knows who he is, the exact kind of films that he wants to make, and how to make them. ‘The Thieves’ proves it.”
“The Thieves” has also been invited to the 37th Toronto International Festival’s “Contemporary World Cinema.” The non-competitive film festival kicks off on Sept. 6 in Toronto, Canada.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10364619,Entertainment agencies expand into new areas,2012-05-28,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2012/05/28/20120528000397_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Dining, drama production and tourism business new way up for South Korean entertainment agencies
After heating up the world, especially Asia, with the Korean Wave, South Korean entertainment agencies are starting to explore other business realms like dining, drama and musical productions and even tourism.
SM Entertainment, one of the top three agencies here armed with popular K-pop groups like Girls’ Generation and Super Junior, will open SM Kraze next month in Cheongdam-dong, southern Seoul, in hand with burger chain Kraze International. The interior will be adorned with hallyu promotional items like photos of SM stars.
Key East, led by biggest shareholder and hallyu star Bae Yong-joon and actor Kim Soo-hyun, runs several restaurants already including Gorilla In the Kitchen in Sinsa-dong, southern Seoul; dessert caf Tea Loft in Lotte Department Store in Sogong-dong, central Seoul; and Korean cuisine restaurant Gosireh in Tokyo.
Park Jin-young, 2PM and Wonder Girls’ JYP Entertainment also opened Korean restaurant Kristalbelli in Manhattan in March.

Some partly invest in dining businesses: Agency IHQ, known for actress Han Ye-seul, and actor Jang Hyuk, made quite a profit by taking care of Caffe Bene’s publicity activities. Fantagio, an agency with heartthrob Gong Yoo as one of its top actors, is investing in dessert restaurant franchise Mango Six.
The food and beverage business is considered as the easiest way for entertainment agencies to find a new way out as it can make the best use out of the popularity of its actors and actresses.
Experts see time agencies as having found ways to diversify income sources which had a rather weak profit-making structure relying heavily on its top stars’ TV appearance fees, endorsement fees and music album profits.
Among SM’s total revenue 109.9 billion won ($93.2 million) last year, for example, sales of music albums reportedly took up 34.67 percent with 38.1 billion won and appearance fees for TV and advertisements 65.33 percent with 71.8 billion won.
For the same reason, agencies are creating various merchandises like bromides, T-shirts and caps with their stars’ faces on, and also stepping into musical and TV drama production businesses.
JYP increased the production of promotional merchandises last year to the point the sales reached 4.5 billion won reportedly, 46.6 percent of its overall revenue.
The agency also co-produced with Key East last year the hit TV drama “Dream High.” At the time emerging stars Kim Soo-hyun and Suzy, also a member of the K-pop girl group miss A, shot to stardom through the drama.
The show reportedly earned Key East over 4.2 billion won last year, which took up 16.2 percent of its total revenue. The drama’s popularity led onto the birth of the sequel “Dream High 2” which aired earlier this year.
SM also revealed hopes to produce more TV shows this year and also open an original musical in the latter half of the year. Some of its singers such as Sunny, Jessica, Taeyeon, Tiffany (all Girls’ Generation) and Oneu (SHINee) already debuted as musical actresses and actors.
Tourism is also rising as an attractive market for entertainment agencies.
Among the 4.98 trillion won worth of production expected to be generated through hallyu, according to Korea Foundation for International Culture Exchange last year, tourism-related productions is assumed to generate about 1.59 trillion won. Linked with hallyu concerts or fan meetings, the sector’s growth is hoped to accelerate even faster.
SM recently purchased BT&I, a travel agency, at 30 billion won. Specific plans are not yet announced but SM is expected to sell travel packages that include hallyu star fan meetings and overseas concerts.
It also works the other way around: tourism agencies are jumping into showbiz as well. Chess Tours which especially focus on Japanese tourists runs entertainment agency My Name Network; BS Tour, BS Star Entertainment; Jau Tour, Jau Entertainment; and Modu Tour, Tourtainment.
“As the hallyu market grows, more entertainment agencies will move to own its own travel agencies, like SM,” said Kim Gil-ho, an official at Corea Entertainment Management Association.

A scene from ""Dream High""
Suzy, a member of a popular K-pop girl group Miss A, talked about her experience doing romantic scenes with some of the hottest male celebrities in Korea during an interview with TV program “Entertainment Broadcast.”
“I was not sure at first, but now I ‘go with the flow’ during a kiss scene,” she said.
Suzy’s first ever experience of on-screen smooching with Taek-yeon, a member of a boy band 2PM, was “awkward” because they barely knew each other at the time.
But Suzy said she “liked” the scene with Kim in a drama “Dream High.” She said Kim even coached her because she had no experience of filming for a romantic scene at the time.
