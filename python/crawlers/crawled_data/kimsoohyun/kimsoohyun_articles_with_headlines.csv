As part of the Disney Contents Showcase Asia Pacific 2024 event held at the Sands Expo & Convention Center on Thursday, the platform unveiled details about several upcoming titles, with the slate including ""Unmasked,"" ""Hyper Knife,"" ""Knock-Off,"" ""Low Life"" and ""Nine Puzzles.""
""Unmasked,"" set to premiere in January 2025, stars Kim Hye-soo, one of Korea’s most celebrated actors, and follows a team of investigative journalists uncovering society’s most heinous crimes.
“The story of people pursuing justice and truth might seem shallow at first glance, but our work incorporates realistic and serious episodes, including topics like fake news,” Kim said at the event. “To make the message accessible, we’ve infused wit and lightened the tone. Each episode offers a distinct mood, combining entertainment with purpose,” she added.
""Low Life,"" featuring Ryu Seung-ryong and Lim Soo-jung, delves into the tale of men vying to recover a newly unearthed treasure. The series has drawn attention under the direction of Kang Yoon-sung, renowned for his work on acclaimed projects like ""Roundup"" and Disney+ original ""Casino.""
“While working on 'Casino,' Disney gave me a great deal of creative freedom,” Kang shared, noting the new project reflected the creator’s vision throughout.
Kang highlighted the “living, breathing characters” as the heart of the series. “Our drama features a diverse cast of characters with unique stories. They assert themselves and move as if they’re alive. The actors worked hard to interpret and bring these roles to life, and I made sure not to overlook any of their efforts,” Kang said.
In ""Hyper Knife,"" Park Eun-bin, acclaimed for her role in ""Extraordinary Attorney Woo,"" takes on the role of a rogue neurosurgeon performing illegal surgeries.
Speaking about the challenging role, Park noted, “Rather than relying on calculated precision, I aimed to evoke emotional outbursts instinctively on set.”
""Knock-Off"" brings together Hallyu stars Kim Soo-hyun and Cho Bo-ah in a tale of a destitute man who dives into the world of counterfeit trade.
Cho shared that the series’ setting, spanning South Korea during the 1990s and 2000s, intrigued her and motivated her to join the project. Meanwhile, Kim expressed interest in his character’s evolution from an ordinary office worker to a salesperson and ultimately a renowned figure in the counterfeit goods industry.
""Nine Puzzles,"" the final series that was introduced as part of Disney+'s slate of 2025 Korean releases, will star Kim Da-mi and Son Suk-ku in a gripping mystery. The story unravels as Son’s character becomes entangled in a chilling case involving a mysterious serial killer.
Yoon Jong-bin, the director of ""Nine Puzzles,"" had previously mentioned that he would not produce another series after the challenging experience of working on the Netflix series ""Narco-Saints."" However, he decided to return to directing for this project because of the compelling power of the script.
""I was physically and mentally exhausted, so I initially didn't plan on taking on another project. I was actually considering doing a film next when I was offered the script for 'Nine Puzzles.' ...But the story was so immersive, and I couldn’t predict what would happen next. It’s about chasing a serial killer, and even I kept thinking, ‘This person must be the culprit,’ only to be proven wrong again and again.""",kimsoohyun,4.0,"The article directly mentions Kim Soo-hyun and discusses his upcoming role in the Disney+ series ""Knock-Off"" where he plays a character who transitions from an office worker to someone involved in counterfeit trade.

The series features a magical romance between Do Min-joon (Kim Soo-hyun), an alien pretending to be a human for hundreds of years after accidentally falling on Earth, and Chun Song-yi (Jun Ji-hyun, also known as Gianna Jun), a top actress who is spirited yet lonely. With its touching romance and well-timed comic scenes, the series garnered die-hard fans beyond Korea, reaching China, Japan, and many other countries. The drama, after its conclusion, was broadcast on the Japanese pay channel DATV, while in China, the Korean foods featured in the show gained huge popularity. Beside the storyline and the acting, the soundtrack was a key part of the series' charm. Every episode featured songs performed by cherished singers across generations, including tracks sung by the male lead, Kim Soo-hyun, himself. Sung Si-kyung, whose unforgettable timbre has made him one of Korea's most beloved ballad singers, composed and sang “Every Moment of You” for the soundtrack. With Sung’s soothing voice and heartwarming melody, the song remains popular even to this day. The lyrics, written by hitmaker Shim Hyun-bo, depict how Do Min-joon fell in love with Chun Song-yi: “And then, the moment I recognized you at a glance / Everything was clearly changing / My world divides into before and after knowing you” The song continues: “I hope I was present in every moment of yours / Just thinking about it makes my heart swell, I'm filled with you” Former Sistar member Hyolyn took part in the soundtrack as well. Although she is known for her powerful voice, she showcased a more tender and tearful voice in ""Good Bye."" The song begins gently, whistling the melody, gradually building up to a climax. The simple, repetitive melody captures the protagonists' fear of an impending separation against their will: “Love has come, but you say you're leaving, I've been waiting, but now I can't see you anymore.” ""My Love from the Star"" features the iconic track ""My Destiny"" by singer Lyn. Even after the drama ended, the song continued to be performed at award ceremonies and at special year-end stages. Lyn won the best soundtrack award for this song at the 50th Baeksang Arts Awards in 2014, a category that was newly established that year. Heartfelt declaration of love, delivered with Lyn’s deep voice, portrays the unbreakable bond between the two main characters despite ongoing trials – even transcending species: “You're the one my love, You are / You're my delight of all / You’re my everlasting love.” The lead actor Kim Soo-hyun sang two songs for the series, ""Promise"" and ""In Front of Your House."" Both songs are arranged to focus on Kim's voice. Especially notable is ""Promise,"" a remake of Lim Byeong-soo's 1984 song. Reinterpreted with acoustic guitar and Kim's gentle voice, the song reflects the situation of the two characters facing separation in episode 19: “On this night when the stars shine unusually bright / It makes me sad that you’re saying you’ll leave after this moment.”",kimsoohyun,5.0,"The article is highly relevant to Kim Soo-hyun as it discusses his dual role as both actor and singer in the drama ""My Love from the Star.""

""Queen of Tears,"" a love story about an estranged couple who once deeply cared for each other, set a new record as the most-watched tvN drama series of all time, with the show's final episode recording a local viewership rating of 24.9 percent. Baek Hyun-woo (Kim Soo-hyun), who grew up in an ordinary household in the countryside, fell in love with Hong Hae-in (Kim Ji-won), the daughter of the owner of top conglomerate Queens Group. Amid Hae-in's battle with untreatable brain tumors and a conspiracy targeting Queens Group, they rekindle their love for one another. Although the series contained several K-drama cliches, including a love story involving a conglomerate and terminal illness, it managed to maintain a sense of novelty with well-timed twists and humor. And, while the latter part of the series may have faced some criticism due to unrealistic plot developments, its soundtrack and high-caliber acting performances still enchanted viewers, transporting them into the story. Crush's ""Love You With All My Heart"" delicately encapsulates the emotional journey of the two protagonists as they navigate misunderstandings and feelings of resentment, ultimately rediscovering their love for each other. The warm, lyrical melody suits Crush's gentle vocals, and the lyrics imply that the two protagonists had always longed for each other, despite having drifted apart: ""Still want you all the time/ I am still waiting for you/ Filling a room in the corner of my heart with longing."" Upon hearing the news of her illness, Hae-in goes to the place she and Hyun-woo visited during their honeymoon. Hyun-woo appears before her, and the two embrace, sincerely expressing their feelings for each other. Tears stream down their faces with the fear of losing each other, accompanied by the lyrics: ""Feelings that I have forgotten and my belated sincerity/ I'm sorry for being so late.” The song ""Fallin’,"" performed by Hong Isaac, winner of the third season of JTBC's “Sing Again,” is poignant, contributing to the story with its dramatic melody. Hong's solemn voice, combined with the strings and escalating chorus, creates the perfect ambiance. ""Fallin’"" was used in a key scene in episode 14, where Hyun-woo smashes the window of a burning car with his bare hands, mistakenly thinking Hae-in had been in an accident. As Hyun-woo sheds tears and tells Hae-in that he was so afraid thinking he had lost her, Hae-in embraces him and promises to survive for him. Here, the lyrics of the soundtrack resonate strongly with the audience: ""Without you, I am nothing/ I won't save any days left without expressing my heart/ I will give them all to you."" Kim Soo-hyun immerses viewers in the story through his outstanding performance in the lead role, as well as his voice. ""Way Home"" brings the series to a beautiful end, complementing the story of the two protagonists whose love survives through all odds.

Aired in 2020, tvN TV series ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" depicts the story of lonely characters who pretend to be average adults despite their vulnerabilities. Ko Moon-young (Seo Ye-ji) is a children’s book writer whose mother -- also a writer --treated her as nothing more than a piece of art. While Moon-young's books are for children, they contain brutally honest emotions. Moon Gang-tae (Kim Soo-hyun), a caregiver at a psychiatric ward, is someone who has devoted his whole life to taking care of his autistic older brother. Moon-young and Gang-tae confront their trauma and wounds deep inside their hearts. The fairy tale is one of the main keywords of this drama. Not only because the female protagonist is a fairy tale writer, but it is her stories where the characters discover their wounds and later get healed. ""My Tale"" is the drama's original soundtrack, sung by Park Won. This song plays the gentle piano melody and the singer's warm voice comforts characters as they explore their hurtful childhood. Through Moon-young's book, ""Zombie Child,"" she implies she truly needed sincere love from their parents. Her mother never loved her back and her father even tried to kill her. Gang-tae also yearned for his mother’s love as she was always preoccupied herself with taking care of her eldest son with autism. Gang-tae sheds tears as he reads Moon-young’s book, recalling his lonely childhood and realizing that he and Moon-young may share the same sorrow. The lyrics show how Gang-tae begins to understand Moon-young: ""The closer I place you and the closer I look at you, we are alike. I know you too well, so I dare not get closer to you. I just watch you from this distance."" As the song progresses, the dramatic string sounds express Gang-tae's love getting intense: ""I want to read you again and again even though I read you every night, my tale."" AKMU vocalist Lee Su-hyun's ""In Your Time,"" another original soundtrack song from the drama, also tells the story of the two lonely children. With a gentle and tranquil piano melody, combined with Lee's crystal-clear voice, the song adorns several scenes with fairy-tale-like mise-en-scene. ""In Your Time"" is played in the fifth episode, when Gang-tae revisits Moon-young's home, which he visited as a child. As the two protagonists, once children, become adults, this episode depicts the years-long bond between them and their still somewhat unresolved wounds. ""I meet you again and find the one I once erased. After those painful days, I hold onto you. I am still living in your time,"" the lyrics go on as two imperfect adults face each other. This song is played again when their tragic past comes to light: Moon-young locks herself in the room after figuring out that her mother is related to a murder case involving Gang-tae's mother. In the finale, the two leave on a trip for the first time in their lives, along with Gang-tae's brother Sang-tae, who also makes his personal growth. The song ""Little by Little"" by singer-songwriter Cheeze plays as the characters find their peace and happiness. As Moon-young, a woman with a defensive attitude, and Gang-tae, who has lived his whole life only caring for his brother, smile at each other with sparkling eyes, the song goes on to say: ""At the end of my dark times I met you, I'm truly thankful because it was you.""

Musical ""Dream High"" is based on the TV series and used some songs from the original soundtrack, but the story shows the story of the main characters 10 years later. Song Sam-song (played by Kim in the TV series) returns to Kiran Arts High School to find his teacher after his career as a K-pop star ends due to buzzing in his ears. ""While Song Sam-dong may appear successful, he is filled with inner fears. I wanted to convey the message to the audience, 'Life may be unstable, but it is going well.'"" The musical version focuses on dance performances. “We have seen many musicals that work through songs. However, in our work, we are striving to find resolutions for the fears and desires of the characters in our story through primal gestures, which are even more fundamental than singing,” director Lee Jong-seok told reporters on Thursday. For the role of Song Sam-dong, the three singers Eum Moon-suk, Winner’s Lee Seung-hoon and SF9’s Yoo Tae-yang alternate to play the failed K-pop star. K-pop boy band Astro member Jinjin, Teen Top’s Niel and rapper MC Gree alternate to portray Jason. “The student characters who are 17 and 18 years old in the musical reminded of my own time. It’s a meaningful production,” Jinjin, who made his debut as a musical actor, said, adding, “I originally took the role because I was ok with dancing, but there was more singing than I expected, which was challenging. But I worked hard to overcome it, just like breaking down a wall to create a path. I feel like I did well in taking on the challenge.""

Starring big-name stars Kim Soo-hyun and Cha Seung-won, ""One Ordinary Day,"" an original by local stream service Coupang Play, is based on BBC's popular crime drama ""Criminal Justice."" The eight-part series delves into the criminal justice system through the story of two men connected to woman's murder. Since its premier on Nov. 27, it has received rave reviews at home and abroad, playing a role in helping the latecoming streamer become the fifth biggest player in the Netflix-led market. Cable channel TV Chosun's ""Uncle"" is a TV adaptation of the British sitcom of the same name, first broadcast in December last year. The comedy is about an uncle who struggles to protect his nephew after his sister's divorce. The Korean show's viewership rose to 9.3 percent for its 14th episode and received critical acclaim for its well-rounded storytelling of social and educational discrimination and domestic violence. Netflix, which has been enjoying boom times in the country for a series of megahits, including ""Squid Game"" and ""All of Us Are Dead,"" will come up with a Korean edition of ""Money Heist,"" a hit Netflix original made in Spain, later this year. Starring ""Squid Game"" star Park Hae-soo, ""Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area"" will feature a group of a genius and thieves who team up to carry out a heist on the Korean Peninsula. The Korean version of the British drama series ""Cleaning Up"" is also up for broadcast in the coming months on local cable channel JTBC. It revolves around three female cleaners at financial companies who are accidentally involved in insider trading. Studio Dragon, a leading TV series production company under the wing of CJ ENM, has confirmed that it will adapt the French comedy ""Call My Agent!"" into Korean, while the American romantic comedy ""Jane the Virgin"" will be also remade into a Korean TV series. Experts said Korean productions are making various efforts to meet rising demand from viewers around the world through borderless platforms. ""Demand for various content has been exploding in recent years, and producers are moving to keep up with the trend,"" culture critic Ha Jae-keun said. For the past decades, Korean adaptations of Japanese original TV series, including the romantic comedies ""Boys Over Flowers"" (2009) and ""Behind the White Tower"" (2007), were preferred. Since the larger-than-expected success of the melodrama ""The World of the Married"" (2020), based on the BBC One TV series ""Doctor Foster,"" Korean producers started to pay more attention to Western shows. ""And Korean-made shows have become some of the most bankable contents in the world,"" said the expert, referring to recent worldwide hits on Netflix.
