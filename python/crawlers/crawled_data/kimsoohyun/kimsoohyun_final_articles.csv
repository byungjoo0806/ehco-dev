As part of the Disney Contents Showcase Asia Pacific 2024 event held at the Sands Expo & Convention Center on Thursday, the platform unveiled details about several upcoming titles, with the slate including ""Unmasked,"" ""Hyper Knife,"" ""Knock-Off,"" ""Low Life"" and ""Nine Puzzles.""
""Unmasked,"" set to premiere in January 2025, stars Kim Hye-soo, one of Korea’s most celebrated actors, and follows a team of investigative journalists uncovering society’s most heinous crimes.
“The story of people pursuing justice and truth might seem shallow at first glance, but our work incorporates realistic and serious episodes, including topics like fake news,” Kim said at the event. “To make the message accessible, we’ve infused wit and lightened the tone. Each episode offers a distinct mood, combining entertainment with purpose,” she added.
""Low Life,"" featuring Ryu Seung-ryong and Lim Soo-jung, delves into the tale of men vying to recover a newly unearthed treasure. The series has drawn attention under the direction of Kang Yoon-sung, renowned for his work on acclaimed projects like ""Roundup"" and Disney+ original ""Casino.""
“While working on 'Casino,' Disney gave me a great deal of creative freedom,” Kang shared, noting the new project reflected the creator’s vision throughout.
Kang highlighted the “living, breathing characters” as the heart of the series. “Our drama features a diverse cast of characters with unique stories. They assert themselves and move as if they’re alive. The actors worked hard to interpret and bring these roles to life, and I made sure not to overlook any of their efforts,” Kang said.
In ""Hyper Knife,"" Park Eun-bin, acclaimed for her role in ""Extraordinary Attorney Woo,"" takes on the role of a rogue neurosurgeon performing illegal surgeries.
Speaking about the challenging role, Park noted, “Rather than relying on calculated precision, I aimed to evoke emotional outbursts instinctively on set.”
""Knock-Off"" brings together Hallyu stars Kim Soo-hyun and Cho Bo-ah in a tale of a destitute man who dives into the world of counterfeit trade.
Cho shared that the series’ setting, spanning South Korea during the 1990s and 2000s, intrigued her and motivated her to join the project. Meanwhile, Kim expressed interest in his character’s evolution from an ordinary office worker to a salesperson and ultimately a renowned figure in the counterfeit goods industry.
""Nine Puzzles,"" the final series that was introduced as part of Disney+'s slate of 2025 Korean releases, will star Kim Da-mi and Son Suk-ku in a gripping mystery. The story unravels as Son’s character becomes entangled in a chilling case involving a mysterious serial killer.
Yoon Jong-bin, the director of ""Nine Puzzles,"" had previously mentioned that he would not produce another series after the challenging experience of working on the Netflix series ""Narco-Saints."" However, he decided to return to directing for this project because of the compelling power of the script.
""I was physically and mentally exhausted, so I initially didn't plan on taking on another project. I was actually considering doing a film next when I was offered the script for 'Nine Puzzles.' ...But the story was so immersive, and I couldn’t predict what would happen next. It’s about chasing a serial killer, and even I kept thinking, ‘This person must be the culprit,’ only to be proven wrong again and again.""",kimsoohyun,4.0,"The article directly mentions Kim Soo-hyun in relation to his acting role in the upcoming Disney+ series ""Knock-Off,"" where he plays a character who transitions from an office worker to someone involved in counterfeit trade.

The series features a magical romance between Do Min-joon (Kim Soo-hyun), an alien pretending to be a human for hundreds of years after accidentally falling on Earth, and Chun Song-yi (Jun Ji-hyun, also known as Gianna Jun), a top actress who is spirited yet lonely. With its touching romance and well-timed comic scenes, the series garnered die-hard fans beyond Korea, reaching China, Japan, and many other countries. The drama, after its conclusion, was broadcast on the Japanese pay channel DATV, while in China, the Korean foods featured in the show gained huge popularity. Beside the storyline and the acting, the soundtrack was a key part of the series' charm. Every episode featured songs performed by cherished singers across generations, including tracks sung by the male lead, Kim Soo-hyun, himself. Sung Si-kyung, whose unforgettable timbre has made him one of Korea's most beloved ballad singers, composed and sang “Every Moment of You” for the soundtrack. With Sung’s soothing voice and heartwarming melody, the song remains popular even to this day. The lyrics, written by hitmaker Shim Hyun-bo, depict how Do Min-joon fell in love with Chun Song-yi: “And then, the moment I recognized you at a glance / Everything was clearly changing / My world divides into before and after knowing you” The song continues: “I hope I was present in every moment of yours / Just thinking about it makes my heart swell, I'm filled with you” Former Sistar member Hyolyn took part in the soundtrack as well. Although she is known for her powerful voice, she showcased a more tender and tearful voice in ""Good Bye."" The song begins gently, whistling the melody, gradually building up to a climax. The simple, repetitive melody captures the protagonists' fear of an impending separation against their will: “Love has come, but you say you're leaving, I've been waiting, but now I can't see you anymore.” ""My Love from the Star"" features the iconic track ""My Destiny"" by singer Lyn. Even after the drama ended, the song continued to be performed at award ceremonies and at special year-end stages. Lyn won the best soundtrack award for this song at the 50th Baeksang Arts Awards in 2014, a category that was newly established that year. Heartfelt declaration of love, delivered with Lyn’s deep voice, portrays the unbreakable bond between the two main characters despite ongoing trials – even transcending species: “You're the one my love, You are / You're my delight of all / You’re my everlasting love.” The lead actor Kim Soo-hyun sang two songs for the series, ""Promise"" and ""In Front of Your House."" Both songs are arranged to focus on Kim's voice. Especially notable is ""Promise,"" a remake of Lim Byeong-soo's 1984 song. Reinterpreted with acoustic guitar and Kim's gentle voice, the song reflects the situation of the two characters facing separation in episode 19: “On this night when the stars shine unusually bright / It makes me sad that you’re saying you’ll leave after this moment.”",kimsoohyun,5.0,"The article is highly relevant to Kim Soo-hyun as it discusses his significant role in ""My Love from the Star"" as Do Min-joon and specifically mentions his singing contributions to the drama's soundtrack (""Promise"" and ""In Front of Your House"").

The rankings are calculated by dividing the total hours viewed by the total runtime. It was the drama's eighth straight week in the top 10 for the category. In addition to its popularity on the streaming platform, the series also set a record on television. The final episode of ""Queen of Tears"" became the most-watched episode ever aired by tvN, the series' broadcaster, surpassing the viewership of episodes from tvN's other hit series such as ""Crash Landing on You"" (2020) and ""Guardian: The Lonely and Great God"" (2017).

""Queen of Tears,"" a love story about an estranged couple who once deeply cared for each other, set a new record as the most-watched tvN drama series of all time, with the show's final episode recording a local viewership rating of 24.9 percent. Baek Hyun-woo (Kim Soo-hyun), who grew up in an ordinary household in the countryside, fell in love with Hong Hae-in (Kim Ji-won), the daughter of the owner of top conglomerate Queens Group. Amid Hae-in's battle with untreatable brain tumors and a conspiracy targeting Queens Group, they rekindle their love for one another. Although the series contained several K-drama cliches, including a love story involving a conglomerate and terminal illness, it managed to maintain a sense of novelty with well-timed twists and humor. And, while the latter part of the series may have faced some criticism due to unrealistic plot developments, its soundtrack and high-caliber acting performances still enchanted viewers, transporting them into the story. Crush's ""Love You With All My Heart"" delicately encapsulates the emotional journey of the two protagonists as they navigate misunderstandings and feelings of resentment, ultimately rediscovering their love for each other. The warm, lyrical melody suits Crush's gentle vocals, and the lyrics imply that the two protagonists had always longed for each other, despite having drifted apart: ""Still want you all the time/ I am still waiting for you/ Filling a room in the corner of my heart with longing."" Upon hearing the news of her illness, Hae-in goes to the place she and Hyun-woo visited during their honeymoon. Hyun-woo appears before her, and the two embrace, sincerely expressing their feelings for each other. Tears stream down their faces with the fear of losing each other, accompanied by the lyrics: ""Feelings that I have forgotten and my belated sincerity/ I'm sorry for being so late.” The song ""Fallin’,"" performed by Hong Isaac, winner of the third season of JTBC's “Sing Again,” is poignant, contributing to the story with its dramatic melody. Hong's solemn voice, combined with the strings and escalating chorus, creates the perfect ambiance. ""Fallin’"" was used in a key scene in episode 14, where Hyun-woo smashes the window of a burning car with his bare hands, mistakenly thinking Hae-in had been in an accident. As Hyun-woo sheds tears and tells Hae-in that he was so afraid thinking he had lost her, Hae-in embraces him and promises to survive for him. Here, the lyrics of the soundtrack resonate strongly with the audience: ""Without you, I am nothing/ I won't save any days left without expressing my heart/ I will give them all to you."" Kim Soo-hyun immerses viewers in the story through his outstanding performance in the lead role, as well as his voice. ""Way Home"" brings the series to a beautiful end, complementing the story of the two protagonists whose love survives through all odds. Featuring the acoustic guitar and the actor’s gentle voice, it is the first song on such a soundtrack performed by Kim Soo-hyun since 2013 hit series ""My Love From the Star."" As Hyun-woo and Hae-in smile and hold hands in a vast lavender field, the song's lyrics flawlessly express, ""The only miracle in my life was the time we shared.""

Aired in 2020, tvN TV series ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" depicts the story of lonely characters who pretend to be average adults despite their vulnerabilities. Ko Moon-young (Seo Ye-ji) is a children’s book writer whose mother -- also a writer --treated her as nothing more than a piece of art. While Moon-young's books are for children, they contain brutally honest emotions. Moon Gang-tae (Kim Soo-hyun), a caregiver at a psychiatric ward, is someone who has devoted his whole life to taking care of his autistic older brother. Moon-young and Gang-tae confront their trauma and wounds deep inside their hearts. The fairy tale is one of the main keywords of this drama. Not only because the female protagonist is a fairy tale writer, but it is her stories where the characters discover their wounds and later get healed. ""My Tale"" is the drama's original soundtrack, sung by Park Won. This song plays the gentle piano melody and the singer's warm voice comforts characters as they explore their hurtful childhood. Through Moon-young's book, ""Zombie Child,"" she implies she truly needed sincere love from their parents. Her mother never loved her back and her father even tried to kill her. Gang-tae also yearned for his mother’s love as she was always preoccupied herself with taking care of her eldest son with autism. Gang-tae sheds tears as he reads Moon-young’s book, recalling his lonely childhood and realizing that he and Moon-young may share the same sorrow. The lyrics show how Gang-tae begins to understand Moon-young: ""The closer I place you and the closer I look at you, we are alike. I know you too well, so I dare not get closer to you. I just watch you from this distance."" As the song progresses, the dramatic string sounds express Gang-tae's love getting intense: ""I want to read you again and again even though I read you every night, my tale."" AKMU vocalist Lee Su-hyun's ""In Your Time,"" another original soundtrack song from the drama, also tells the story of the two lonely children. With a gentle and tranquil piano melody, combined with Lee's crystal-clear voice, the song adorns several scenes with fairy-tale-like mise-en-scene. ""In Your Time"" is played in the fifth episode, when Gang-tae revisits Moon-young's home, which he visited as a child. As the two protagonists, once children, become adults, this episode depicts the years-long bond between them and their still somewhat unresolved wounds. ""I meet you again and find the one I once erased. After those painful days, I hold onto you. I am still living in your time,"" the lyrics go on as two imperfect adults face each other. This song is played again when their tragic past comes to light: Moon-young locks herself in the room after figuring out that her mother is related to a murder case involving Gang-tae's mother. In the finale, the two leave on a trip for the first time in their lives, along with Gang-tae's brother Sang-tae, who also makes his personal growth. The song ""Little by Little"" by singer-songwriter Cheeze plays as the characters find their peace and happiness. As Moon-young, a woman with a defensive attitude, and Gang-tae, who has lived his whole life only caring for his brother, smile at each other with sparkling eyes, the song goes on to say: ""At the end of my dark times I met you, I'm truly thankful because it was you.""

Musical ""Dream High"" is based on the TV series and used some songs from the original soundtrack, but the story shows the story of the main characters 10 years later. Song Sam-song (played by Kim in the TV series) returns to Kiran Arts High School to find his teacher after his career as a K-pop star ends due to buzzing in his ears. ""While Song Sam-dong may appear successful, he is filled with inner fears. I wanted to convey the message to the audience, 'Life may be unstable, but it is going well.'"" The musical version focuses on dance performances. “We have seen many musicals that work through songs. However, in our work, we are striving to find resolutions for the fears and desires of the characters in our story through primal gestures, which are even more fundamental than singing,” director Lee Jong-seok told reporters on Thursday. For the role of Song Sam-dong, the three singers Eum Moon-suk, Winner’s Lee Seung-hoon and SF9’s Yoo Tae-yang alternate to play the failed K-pop star. K-pop boy band Astro member Jinjin, Teen Top’s Niel and rapper MC Gree alternate to portray Jason. “The student characters who are 17 and 18 years old in the musical reminded of my own time. It’s a meaningful production,” Jinjin, who made his debut as a musical actor, said, adding, “I originally took the role because I was ok with dancing, but there was more singing than I expected, which was challenging. But I worked hard to overcome it, just like breaking down a wall to create a path. I feel like I did well in taking on the challenge.""

The eight-part series delves into the criminal justice system through the story of two men connected to woman's murder. Since its premier on Nov. 27, it has received rave reviews at home and abroad, playing a role in helping the latecoming streamer become the fifth biggest player in the Netflix-led market. Cable channel TV Chosun's ""Uncle"" is a TV adaptation of the British sitcom of the same name, first broadcast in December last year. The comedy is about an uncle who struggles to protect his nephew after his sister's divorce. The Korean show's viewership rose to 9.3 percent for its 14th episode and received critical acclaim for its well-rounded storytelling of social and educational discrimination and domestic violence. Netflix, which has been enjoying boom times in the country for a series of megahits, including ""Squid Game"" and ""All of Us Are Dead,"" will come up with a Korean edition of ""Money Heist,"" a hit Netflix original made in Spain, later this year.

The Korean version of the British drama series ""Cleaning Up"" is also up for broadcast in the coming months on local cable channel JTBC. It revolves around three female cleaners at financial companies who are accidentally involved in insider trading. Studio Dragon, a leading TV series production company under the wing of CJ ENM, has confirmed that it will adapt the French comedy ""Call My Agent!"" into Korean, while the American romantic comedy ""Jane the Virgin"" will be also remade into a Korean TV series. Experts said Korean productions are making various efforts to meet rising demand from viewers around the world through borderless platforms. ""Demand for various content has been exploding in recent years, and producers are moving to keep up with the trend,"" culture critic Ha Jae-keun said. For the past decades, Korean adaptations of Japanese original TV series, including the romantic comedies ""Boys Over Flowers"" (2009) and ""Behind the White Tower"" (2007), were preferred.

In the summer, when the country was struggling with a resurgence in novel coronavirus infections, TV studios and broadcasters halted productions of dramas and shows. Entertainment giant CJ ENM and its drama production affiliate Studio Dragon suspended drama filming for a week in August, with several shows on tvN and OCN affected by the stoppage. Other networks, including KBS and SBS, followed them. Subsequent temporary suspensions and delays stemming from tightened social distancing have slowed down scheduled productions for this year and struck a blow to the industry as a whole. As a result, public broadcasters, like KBS and MBC, which do not have their own studios, are projected to come up with fewer than 10 dramas for next year. In 2019, an average 12 dramas were aired on 10 South Korean TV channels, according to industry data. Only a few series on the 2020 lineup are under spotlight, including tvN's ""Jirisan,"" starring Jun Ji-hyun, and ""Vincenzo,"" starring Song Joong-ki, and Netflix's ""Kingdom: Ashin of the North."" ""Due partly to the lingering virus pandemic, it's become too hard and expensive to produce a TV drama,"" culture critic Kim Heon-shik said. ""But the unprecedented coronavirus epidemic is not the only reason that the TV channels have been reducing drama productions."" A paradigm shift to online multi-channel platforms, such as YouTube or Netflix, is also behind the trend, he added. An increasing number of young people do not watch TV and prefer short-form web-based series available anywhere and anytime on their smartphones. ""Expensive TV series starring big-name stars no longer guarantee higher viewership ratings,"" the expert said. ""Those stars also turn their eyes to other platforms that provide the content to more than 100 countries."" Star-studded blockbuster dramas failed to catch the eyes of viewers this year, putting financially-troubled broadcasters into a corner. The romance, ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay,"" logged an audience share in the 4-6 percent range throughout its 16-episode run. It was a disappointing number considering that the series was highly anticipated as star actor Kim Soo-hyun's first appearance on the small screen in about five years. Instead, Netflix's original series, like the teen crime drama ""Extracurricular"" and the second season of the zombie thriller ""Kingdom,"" gained huge popularity on the global streaming platform.

The broadcast censorship body on Wednesday held a subcommittee and decided to issue a legal sanction to the television series for several breaches against the broadcast deliberation regulations, including Article 27 on duties of integrity and Article 30 on gender equality. “Even considering the fact that they were meant to exaggeratedly express a character’s personality, (the scenes in question) show how insensitive the drama’s producers are to gender equality in broadcasting content that may belittle a certain gender and hold the possibility to justify sexual harassment and molestation,” the subcommission said, adding the use of excessive abusive language in the series also contributed to the decision. In the third episode of the series that aired June 27, female lead Mun-young, a figure with a personality disorder, overtly stares and touches male lead Gang-tae’s body as he gets dressed. The drama series was also slammed by internet users for scenes where another male character, who suffers from manic depression and exhibitionism, reveals parts of his bare body, with his genitals covered by a drawing of an elephant. A “warning” as a legal sanction is considered a heavy penalty here, as it affects the broadcaster unfavorably during the KCSC’s annual broadcast evaluation for license renewal.

The romance thriller ""The World of the Married,"" the South Korean adaptation of BBC's ""Doctor Foster,"" was the biggest hit TV series during the period, with its viewership reaching as high as 28.4 percent. It is the highest-ever rating by a drama on a non-terrestrial TV channel. The 16-episode drama, which features the revenge of a dedicated wife, played by Kim Hee-ae, coupled with intense suspense and unpredictable storytelling, also won director Mo Wan-il the best TV director award at this year's Baeksang Arts Awards. JTBC's ""Itaewon Class,"" starring star actor Park Seo-joon, was the No. 2 drama of the first half with viewership of 16.5 percent, the seventh-highest viewership rating in cable television history. In a bid to maintain the competitive edge in the second half of the year, the broadcaster has launched the mystery ""Graceful Friend,"" portraying close friends who face a murder in their town, and the crime drama ""The Good Detective,"" a battle between detectives who reveal the truth and cover it up. On the other hand, tvN, a cable channel run by entertainment giant CJ ENM, suffered a worse-than-expected first-half performance, except for the romantic comedy ""Crash Landing On You,"" which started its 16-episode run in December last year. Its prime-time series including the romantic comedy ""Oh My Baby,"" starring Jang Na-ra, and the romance drama ""It's OK to Not Be OK,"" starring Kim Soo-hyun, failed to impress South Korean viewers. ""Oh My Baby,"" about a workaholic single woman, recorded 2.9 percent in viewership rating at best and quietly finished its 16th episode on July 2. Premiering on June 20, ""It's OK,"" was one of the most anticipated TV series as Korean wave star Kim's return project after his two-year military duty. But its audience share has been hovering around 5 percent. To break the stalemate, tvN has come up with a star-studded lineup for the second half. Starring Cho Seung-woo and Bae Doona, ""Stranger 2,"" the sequel to the 2016 popular crime drama ""Stranger,"" will air in August. Heartthrob actor Park Bo-gum and ""Parasite"" star Park So-dam will star in tvN's romance ""Record of Youth"" in September, while Bae Suzi and Nam Joo-hyuk are cast for ""Startup"" slated for October. Terrestrial broadcasters like KBS and MBC remain in the doldrums as their shows hardly created a buzz over the first six months. KBS' thriller ""Woman of 9.9 Billion"" and MBC's office comedy ""Kkondae Intern,"" also known as ""Old School Intern,"" are the only two series that made their presence felt on the small screen. SBS received better results than the two rivals, with its medical drama ""Dr. Romantic 2"" and legal drama ""Hyena"" marking double-digit viewership ratings. But its blockbuster fantasy show ""The King: Eternal Monarch,"" starring Lee Min-ho, was a complete flop in the first half.

During the show’s fifth episode that aired Friday, a man who introduces himself as Nigerian encounters a Korean man with a similar dreadlocked hairstyle to his own in a convenience store and the two suddenly embrace each other as they “belong to the same Jamaican family.” Singing incomprehensible melodies, the two dance together to instrumental music. The scene sparked a outrage from the drama’s foreign viewers. Comments on social media included, “Tell me why this is on a popular K-drama in this day and age. As much as I love Ji Chang-wook, this drama has got to go” and “This is so stereotyping. They really think every African person is the same. I’m so disgusted by the fact this drama is made in 2020.” The SBS drama, starring Kim You-jung and Ji Chang-wook, was in hot water even before its first episode aired because the web comic series it is based on had a lot of sexually suggestive scenes. The web comic of the same title contained sexual objectification of an underage female, as the story depicts a romance between an underage employee and a grown-up male manager of a convenience store. In response to outcries of concern, the series’ director Lee Myung-woo explained that the series is a show that the whole family can watch together, “Only taking the positive energy of the two lead characters in the original comic.” As the show hit the air, however, the series instantly received criticism from viewers due to several scenes, including one showing a high-school girl flirting with a grown-up man and kissing him on the lips and another portraying prostitution -- not depicted in the original web comic -- which is prohibited by law in Korea. A few days after the first episode aired, more than 6,000 complaints were made on the webpage of the Korea Communication Standards Commission, some even calling for the show to be halted, while others took it to the broadcaster’s website and social media to lash out at the drama’s controversial scenes. According to the explanation made by an official from the KCSC on Wednesday, a subcommittee is expected to deliberate the episodes in relation to Article 27 (duties of integrity) and Article 51 (use of broadcasting language) of the body’s review regulation. “It seems the producer believed he could sublimate such problematic elements of the original web comic -- whether it be the sexual or the discriminatory aspects -- through exaggerated black comedy, which was also shown in the producer’s previous series ‘The Fiery Priest,’” TV drama critic Yun Suk-jin told The Korea Herald. “The thought that he could adapt the original content to drama overlooking such elements was a mistake.” Meanwhile, post-military comeback piece for heartthrob Kim Soo-hyun, tvN’s “It’s Okay to Not Be Okay” also received over 50 complaints on KCSC website regarding its scenes depicting sexual harassment.　 In the show’s third episode, which aired on June 27, the lead female character Mun-young, played by Seo Ye-ji, makes her way into the men’s dressing room and gazes overtly at Gang-tae, played by Kim, as he gets changed, touching his bare body against his will and making sexually offensive remarks to him. Mun-young, who is depicted as having a personality disorder, continues to make judgmental comments about Gang-tae’s appearance, calling him “pretty,” and treating him like her possession. The KCSC official added the deliberation on “It’s Okay to Not Be Okay” has not been decided yet. Yun, also a professor of Korean literature at Chungnam University, explained the discordance between the TV producers and the younger viewers in their sensitivity to gender issues may be the fundamental reason behind the continuing controversies. “The expression ‘gender-sensitivity’ itself is unfamiliar to many in our society, and although ideas about gender equality have been evolving fast recently, this is not portrayed in television drama productions. These idle attitudes (toward gender) held by producers, pushed by their battle for viewership ratings, ends up to the creation of such inappropriate scenes.” By Choi Ji-won ()",kimsoohyun,3.0,"The article mentions Kim Soo-hyun specifically in relation to his post-military comeback drama ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" and discusses a controversy surrounding one of its scenes.

But the show fizzled out despite its all-star cast of Lee and actress Kim Go-eun and star screenwriter Kim Eun-sook, who has created smash hit series, such as the fantasy ""Guardian: The Lonely and Great God"" (2016) and the periodical drama ""Mr. Sunshine"" (2018). Its viewership ratings have hovered around 7 percent, far lower than expected, since its first episode aired on April 17. Its final episode on June 12 reached 8.1 percent. Last week, star actor Kim Soo-hyun made a comeback to the entertainment scene in three years with tvN's weekend series ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay."" It is about a romance between a caretaker and a novelist. Kim, regarded as one of the biggest Korean Wave, or ""hallyu,"" stars with selling power across Asia, temporarily left show business to serve in the military after his last silver screen project, ""Real,"" was a box office flop in 2017. The series' first-week results were worse-than-expected, as it logged 6.1 percent in viewership for its first episode Saturday but dropped to 4.7 percent for the next one. In contrast, his cameo appearances on ""Hotel del Luna"" and ""Crash Landing On You"" months ago made headlines in newspapers. Ji Chang-wook, who was discharged from the military in April last year, has also been struggling to make his presence felt again. His return project ""Melting Me Softly"" (2019), a romantic comedy on tvN, received poor viewership ratings of 1-2 percent throughout its 16 episodes. He made a second attempt with the latest romantic comedy ""Backstreet Rookies,"" which premiered on June 19 on SBS. Based on the adult-only web-based cartoon with the same title, the drama is about a convenience store manager who gets entangled with an eccentric part-timer. But the series has been embroiled in controversy over its sexually explicit scenes and lines. And its first episode posted 6.3 percent in viewership, lower than its predecessor, ""The King.""

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2333809,Kim Soo-hyun returns to small screen with ‘It’s Okay to Not Be Okay’,2020-06-13,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2020/06/11/20200611000558_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Kim Soo-hyun is returning to the small screen for the first time in five years with tvN’s new romantic comedy series “It’s Okay to Not Be Okay” set to start airing next week. The upcoming weekend series is the first television role for the 31-year-old since he was discharged from the military last July. His most recent TV credits include “The Producers” in 2015 and “My Love From the Star” in 2013. “I’ve been waiting for so long, I’m really nervous but also excited to come back,” Kim said Wednesday during a promotional media event. The event was livestreamed due to concerns over COVID-19. In the series about people living with mental illness, Kim plays Gang-tae, who works as a caretaker in the psychiatric ward of a hospital. Gang-tae, who also cares for his autistic brother at home, is reluctant to pursue any romantic relationships. Actress Seo Ye-ji plays Mun-young, a bestselling children’s book author who has a personality disorder. While Mun-young is apparently unable to love anyone, Gang-tae seems to be able to melt her cold heart as the two become a source of healing for each other. “(Mun-young) pursues a unique style. It’s not to show off herself but it’s like a defense mechanism. She’s telling people to not to approach her or talk to her,” Seo said. Actor Oh Jeong-sae, who recently won best supporting actor on television at the Baeksang Arts Awards for his role in the KBS drama “When the Camellia Blooms,” stars as Gang-tae’s older brother Sang-tae. Rookie actress Park Gyu-young stars as a nurse who falls for Gang-tae. “I think the title says it all. I feel everyone, including myself, in this world is a little bit mad in some ways and I wanted to take the chance to think about whether this is actually bad or not,” the series’ director, Park Sin-woo, said. Park previously produced the 2018 series “Encounter,” featuring Song Hye-kyo and Park Bo-gum, and SBS’ “Don’t Dare to Dream,” starring Gong Hyo-jin and Cho Jung-seok. Quoting screenwriter Jo Yong, Park said the drama was “an apology to people with disabilities.” “We often judge other people and hurt them, and the writer says she wrote the script based on her own experiences, wanting to face those people properly,” the director said. “I hope that, after watching the 16 episodes, people will want to befriend disabled people rather than trying to help them,” Oh said. “I wanted to show how Gang-tae is healed of his inner wounds,” Kim said. “There are many different stories and forms of love in the drama, and I hope the viewers can also heal their own wounds following them,” Kim said.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1423740,Geopolitical feuds hamper Korean Wave in China,2017-08-19,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2017/08/19/20170819000027_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"South Korea's entertainment industry was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the diplomatic normalization with China in 1992. Its pop songs, dramas and movies flooded into the once banned communist country, which has become the springboard for ""hallyu,"" or the growing popularity of South Korean popular culture. But they have recently emerged as a victim of politics. Korean showbiz faces the hardest time since entering China 25 years ago amid a raging anti-Korean sentiment and state restrictions sparked by ongoing diplomatic feuds over the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea. The two Cold War foes established diplomatic ties on Aug. 24, 1992, opening the way for cultural exchanges between the two countries. China had its first taste of Korean pop culture in 1993, when the South Korean drama ""Jealousy"" was bought and aired by China's state-run CCTV. Since then, over 100 Korean TV series were broadcast in China, mostly to positive reaction. Hallyu, or the Korean Wave, hit its stride in China through TV shows during the early-to-mid 2000s with hit series such as ""Autumn Tale"" (2000) and ""Daejanggeum"" (2005). But the presence of Korean television shows later waned in China after Beijing imposed a cap on foreign TV dramas aired in the country. It wasn't until ""The Heirs,"" starring Lee Min-ho and Park Shin-hye, was made available via the online streaming platform iQiyi in 2013, that hallyu entered a renaissance phase. Lee became one of the most sought-out celebrities, appearing on ""New Year's Gala,"" one of China's premier television events on CCTV. Demand for Korean TV shows soared with the airing of ""My Love from the Star,"" a time-travel alien fantasy series starring Kim Soo-hyun and Jun Ji-hyun, and later skyrocketed with last year's ""Descendants of the Sun,"" featuring Song Joong-ki and Song Hye-kyo. ""In my view, Korea has relatively more appealing and talented actors. Also the Korean production industry's tight screenplays and films seem to have attracted demand from Chinese viewers,"" said a South Korean producer who is currently working for a Chinese satellite TV network. Han Jae-hyuk, head of the Korean Cultural Center in China, pointed out how the term hallyu was first coined in China. ""Hallyu first emerged from China after H.O.T was showcased in the country in 2000. After establishing diplomatic relations, the two sides have had a wide range of exchanges, to the degree that there is almost no Chinese person who hasn't watched a Korean drama,"" said Han. But for the past year or so it's become impossible to see Korean TV shows in China. China virtually banned South Korean cultural and entertainment products in protest of Seoul's decision to set up a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery on its soil. Seoul says it is to better protect itself from the ever-rising military threats posed by North Korea, but Beijing believes the THAAD system can be used to monitor its own military activities, thereby hampering regional peace and stability. Partnerships and joint projects in areas such as TV shows, games and music between the two countries were abruptly suspended, seriously hurting South Korean companies that had made hefty financial commitments. SBS TV's ""Saimdang, Memoir of Colors,"" for example, was intended to be aired in South Korea and China simultaneously, but Beijing's broadcast regulator is still sitting on its approval. TV footage of Korean stars was edited out, and scheduled concerts and fan meet-and-greets for K-pop stars, such as EXO and BIGBANG, were banned without explanation. But the ban doesn't necessarily mean the Chinese aren't consuming Korean products. Piracy over the Internet has allowed unfettered access to even the most up-to-date Korean TV shows. News stories on ""Legend of the Blue Sea"" and ""Guardian: The Lonely and Great God"" have racked up billions of views on Chinese portals, suggesting that Korean shows are being widely pirated. In the past, most of the Chinese networks had paid for licenses to adopt South Korean programs, but intellectual property theft is becoming more common after the culture ban, with copycat shows of ""Three Meals a Day,"" ""Fantastic Duo"" and Youn's Kitchen"" having been introduced. On the music record front, K-pop is still going strong. G-Dragon of boy band BIGBANG sold 762,000 copies of his latest solo album ""Kwon Ji Yong"" in June on release day alone, while groups EXO and EXID are also among the top-tier artists on major music streaming charts. Experts say that in order to better appease China in general, creators must prioritize the quality of their content. ""Most of the time, China tends to be engaged with the U.S. and Japan in geopolitical issues. But it's not as if, for example, American and Japanese animation movies perform poorly because of pending issues,"" said Kim Ki-heon, head of Korea Creative Content Agency's Beijing office. Others say that Korea should also focus on exporting its skills and technology in culture, alongside selling packaged cultural products to China. ""Rather than stressing that this or that is a 'Korean' movie, more companies should try to apply their ideas and technology within the Chinese market and try to increase their clout in China,"" said Kim Pil-jeong, head of the Korean Film Council's Beijing office.

In 2014, “My Love From the Star,” featuring Kim Soo-hyun as a charming extraterrestrial and Jun Ji-hyun as a loveable actress, caused a sensation throughout Asia. In 2016, military romance “Descendants of the Sun,” starring Song Joong-ki and Song Hye-kyo, swept fans in the region off their feet. Earlier this year, “Guardian: The Lonely and Great God” propelled its lead Gong Yoo to global fame, despite a de facto ban in China on entertainment from Korea. The Korea Herald asked experts for their forecasts for the K-drama industry in the coming years. The consensus is that the scale of production will inevitably become larger and storylines more diverse. Family drama, romantic comedies here to stay  In terms of content, K-dramas originally rose to fame for their detailed descriptions of family life and ideal love stories. Though topics are becoming increasingly diverse, experts predict these staples will remain fixtures of K-drama in the years to come.　 “Even if family structures are changing these days, the fantasy that family dramas offer will not wane,” said culture critic Jung Deok-hyun. “It’s like how we thirst for the analog as we evolve deeper into the digital age.”　 The family dramas to come in the future will, however, have to accommodate the changes in the average Korean household, Jung added.　 Currently, TV dramas boasting the highest ratings in Korea continue to be weekend series aimed at middle-aged and elderly women, such as “My Father Is Strange” (27.9 percent) and “Band of Sisters” (17.6 percent), which focus on the dynamics of marriage and multigenerational households. 　 Outside of Korea, romantic comedies such as “The Heirs” (2013), featuring billionaire high schoolers’ entangled love lives, continue to draw in the bulk of younger viewers in their 20s and below.　 “Viewers are becoming more sophisticated,” said Park Hyun, CEO of global K-drama streaming site DramaFever. “The younger viewers who were with us nine years ago have now aged. They’re savvy about Korean culture and access information quickly.” 　 The streaming site, acquired by Warner Bros. last year, was the sole global platform to stream “Guardian: The Lonely and Great God.” 　 Though the show is darker than a typical romantic comedy, intricately mixing drama and fantasy, it drew in fans. 　 “It became our most-watched and re-watched Korean series,” Park said. Several recent K-dramas have been genre series, such as gripping investigative thrillers and time-traveling science-fiction. Thrillers such as “Signal,” “Tunnel” and most recently, “Stranger” have received rave reviews among viewers and critics alike. 　 “‘Stranger’ is the most outstanding result that inherits only the best of the Korean genre drama, which has undergone a long trial and error period,” drama critic and TV personality Heo Ji-woong wrote in a column this month, citing the history of past acclaimed genre dramas such as “Sign” (2011) and “Nine: Nine Time Travels” (2013). 　 Starring Bae Doo-na and Jo Seung-woo, “Stranger” tells a well-constructed story of an unfeeling prosecutor and passionate police investigator. Heo went on to comment that the subtle tonal balance the drama achieves is “almost like a performance.” “It is not predictable, but it also appeals to the general public.” 　 The show was the debut work of scriptwriter Lee Soo-yeon, spotlighted as a promising talent.　 The Korean brand of genre dramas is beginning to be recognized abroad as well. Scriptwriter Kim Eun-hee, who penned “Signal,” is writing a new drama series called “Kingdom,” to be produced by global streaming giant Netflix.

His last film was the 2013 “Secretly, Greatly.” The script of “Real” had made a deep imprint in his mind, Kim said. “I couldn’t get it out of my head. I couldn’t sleep. I said to myself, ‘a frightening script has come my way.’” In the film, Kim plays the dual role of casino gang boss Jang Tae-young who is suffering from a multiple personality disorder, and his alter ego, a freelance reporter. Kim gives vigorous performances as the dangerous drug-addicted mobster engaged in a turf war with a rival gang, his eerie doppelganger and a meek reporter investigating the effects of a powerful new drug. Lee Sung-min plays the ghoulish doctor who psychoanalyzes Jang. Former K-pop singer Sulli, credited with her real name Choi Jin-ri, makes her acting debut as Song Yoo-hwa, a physical therapy expert and Jang’s lover. The film is the directorial debut of Lee Sa-rang (Love Lee), who said he had wanted to create “a new type of story.” Lee is also Kim‘s cousin and the head of a film production company. “I wanted to go beyond our everyday feelings and logic. I thought that this type of movie should also exist.” The film boasts a futuristic setting complete with blazing red neon lights and towering cityscapes, matched with deep, reverberating electronic music and scenes that jumble memories and the subconscious. The alter egos that Kim plays are “wannabes” of each other, Lee said. 　 “They both want to be the real thing. But if you ask them what ‘real’ is, I don’t think either of them know. “When we talk about what is ‘real,’ if felt like faith. Belief that something is real. I didn’t want to pinpoint one correct answer and explain it to viewers.” Kim, meanwhile, has yet to fulfill his mandatory military obligations. “The exact timing hasn’t been decided,” he said on his upcoming enlistment and future plans. “It would be great if I could do one more film or drama before going (to the military).” Singer-turned-actress Choi said that shooting “Real” has awakened in her a yearning for acting. “I felt a sense of accomplishment. I wonder if I have ever wanted to do something as much as act,” she said.

Experts have reportedly warned that the cliff face was unstable and could result in deadly rock falls due to having been previously used as a quarry up to 1994. However, the city is known to have made exceptions for mass Chinese tour groups. The Incheon Tourism Organization said, “On occasions when the tourists make a group request through their travel agency, we have allowed short visits arranged in a way so that they were not too near the hazardous parts.”　　 The Incheon city government plans to conduct meetings with relevant authorities on Monday to bolster safety measures and reopen the area as quickly as possible.
