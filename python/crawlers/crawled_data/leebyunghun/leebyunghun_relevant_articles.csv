In the autumn of 2000, as South Korea and North Korea engaged in their first tentative steps toward reconciliation, a film about four soldiers from the South and the North playing cards across the world's most fortified border opened in theatres here.
The premise seemed improbable, even dangerous, as South Korea's National Security Law, more strictly enforced back then, punishes any depiction of North Korea in the media in a favorable light.
""Joint Security Area,"" however, struck a chord so profound that it would alter the trajectory of South Korean cinema, launching a constellation of talent that would define the industry for decades to come.
This week, in a multiplex in Seoul's Yongsan district — itself a palimpsest of military history, where American bases once stood — the film's director Park Chan-wook and cast gathered for production company CJ ENM's ""Visionary"" award ceremony.
The occasion carried a particular poignancy for the auteur: Park, now revered for baroque revenge thrillers like ""Oldboy"" (2003) and the more crystalline ""Decision to Leave"" (2022), was then a filmmaker on his last chance.
""I knew if this one didn't work out, it could very well be my last film,"" Park recalled.
Such vulnerability might seem unimaginable given the arthouse icon he is today. But after his previous works -- ""The Moon Is What the Sun Dreams Of"" (1992) and ""Trio"" (1997) -- proved both commercial and critical disappointments, Park was struggling to find his footing.
""As you know, in this business, if a director fails twice, getting a third opportunity is almost unheard of.""
""The production team had my back and I got to work with these incredible actors,"" Park said. ""I made a point to listen more, hear the actors' ideas and have open conversations with them. Honestly, the whole thing felt like a miracle.""
The story Park chose to tell -- of forbidden friendships in the DMZ, where a shooting incident sparks an investigation by a Swiss-Korean officer, manages to convince both as a historical commentary and a crowd-pleasing whodunnit. Its Rashomon-like non-linear structure, peeling away layers of official narrative to reveal human connection beneath, provided a template for what Korean cinema could become: technically virtuosic, emotionally acute and politically charged.
Locally, it dominated the 2000 box office with nearly six million admissions, benefiting from the optimistic thaw between the Koreas following a historic summit. For international audiences, it served as a crucial entry point into Korean cinema and the heart-wrenching reality of the divided peninsula, even earning a place at the 51st Berlinale.
Lee Byung-hun, cast as the South Korean sergeant, had been struggling to transition from television to serious cinema when ""Joint Security Area"" came along.
""Here we were— a director who had already managed to perfectly flop two films, and me, an actor who had completely tanked three. What a match made in heaven, right?"" Lee said. Lee would go on to become one of Korea's most celebrated actors -- recently, he completed shooting on Park's latest film, ""No Other Choice.""
Song Kang-ho, masterful as the gruff but principled North Korean sergeant, said he initially balked at the script's perfection.
""The script felt too perfect — dense, meticulous, and so tightly packed with detail. I'd never seen anything like it, and honestly, it made me a bit skeptical,"" he said.
""Over the past 30 years, I've had my fair share of ups and downs as an actor. But JSA will always be unforgettable to me, like a season in full bloom.""
Perhaps most intriguing in the film is Lee Young-ae as Sophie Jean, whose Swiss-Korean heritage makes her both the ideal investigator and embodiment of complex history. Despite her occasionally uncertain English, the role launched a collaboration with Park that would culminate in ""Lady Vengeance"" (2005), where she delivered one of Korean cinema's most indelible portraits of retribution.
""I was in my late 20s when I did this film, and it opened the door for me to take on great projects in my 30s, both in film and TV. For me, this film was a kind of gateway, a truly miraculous one,"" she said.
Twenty-five years have transformed these once-emerging talents into industry titans, with Korean culture having been catapulted onto the global stage.
Yet, the peninsula's division remains unchanged. Recent decisions by both sides to arm their JSA personnel, breaking a 2019 military agreement, stand as a testament to the enduring presence of the film's central conflict.
""The fact that the themes of this film can still resonate so strongly with today's younger generation is, in a way, a sad reality,"" Park said.
""I hope that by the time we celebrate its 50th anniversary, it'll feel more like a story from the distant past.""",leebyunghun,5.0,"The article is highly relevant to Lee Byung-hun as it discusses his pivotal role in ""Joint Security Area,"" a film that helped launch his serious film career.

The film began filming last August and is aimed for release later this year.
""I started writing the script for this movie almost 17 years ago. I feel deeply emotional as I've finally finished filming the project I've wanted to make the most for so long,"" the company quoted Park as saying.
""I will dedicate myself to the final stages of production to create a film everyone involved can feel proud of.""
Lead actor Lee Byung-hun, most recently seen as the Front Man in Netflix's global sensation ""Squid Game,"" expressed his excitement about the film.
""I've never anticipated a project like this before. ... The memories of exchanging ideas with the director like old friends will stay with me,"" he said.
Co-lead Son Ye-jin said she joined the film as a fan of both the director and Lee.
""Watching the filming process, I kept thinking something extraordinary was being created,"" she said.
The film follows Man-soo (played by Lee), a middle-aged man who, after being suddenly fired from a paper company, becomes determined to find a new job and deals with those standing in his way.
Son, known for the popular TV series ""Crash Landing on You"" (2019-2020) and the movie ""The Negotiation"" (2018), will play the role of Man-soo's cheerful and mentally strong wife, A-ra.

A household name in Korea with a career spanning 34 years, Lee Byung-hun returns to the screen as the enigmatic villain in season two of Netflix’s global hit ""Squid Game."" Having made a tantalizing cameo in the show’s inaugural season, Lee now commands center stage as the complex mastermind known as Frontman.
The acclaimed actor -- whose filmography boasts iconic hits such as ""Inside Men"" and ""Mr. Sunshine"" -- tackles the intricate layers of Frontman, a character whose chilling authority conceals a labyrinthine past.
Season one left viewers speculating about his identity, but the second installment peels back the curtain to reveal the man behind the mask: Hwang In-ho, a former champion of the deadly games himself.
For Lee, embodying Frontman was a psychological marathon. Beyond his duties as the malevolent architect, in the new season, Frontman assumes the alias Young-il to infiltrate the competition alongside Ki-hun (played by Lee Jung-jae), who returns determined to stop the games.
In a recent interview, Lee revealed that the greatest challenge in portraying Frontman was navigating the complexity of the character's three identities: Young-il, Hwang In-ho and Frontman.
“Viewers know about Frontman, but they don’t know about Hwang In-ho,” Lee shared during a group interview in Samcheong-dong, Seoul, Wednesday.
""On top of that, I had to hide my identity and act as Young-il in front of the new game participants. I felt that all three of these characters had to coexist within me. It was a continuous process of shifting between these personas in each scene,"" said Lee.
When asked about the most grueling moment in portraying the Frontman, Lee pointed to the scene involving the mingle game, where participants had to form groups based on a randomly assigned number and race to a room before time expired.
“The most difficult scene was during the (mingle) game, where I kill a participant right in front of Jung-bae. In that scene, I felt that Front Man, Hwang In-ho and Oh Young-il had to shift back and forth within a split second. Expressing those subtle differences was the hardest part,"" he said.
In dissecting Frontman’s overarching strategy, Lee noted that his character assumes a detached omnipresence -- a figure pulling strings from the shadows.
“Frontman is someone who looks down from above. In the game, he watched Ki-hun closely from right beside him with that very perspective. He anticipated what Ki-hun would think and how he would act, even driving him into desperate situations while playing alongside him,"" he said.
Lee's masterful portrayal of a layered character follows his international career. A pioneer among Korean actors making their mark in Hollywood, Lee debuted on the global stage with 2009 blockbuster ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra."" Since then, he’s shared screen time with cinematic heavyweights in ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation,"" ""Terminator Genisys,"" ""Misconduct"" and ""The Magnificent Seven.""
His trajectory seemed destined for Hollywood stardom, yet an unexpected twist has emerged, positioning Lee at the center of an entirely different wave of recognition.
Despite his notable Hollywood credentials, Lee confessed that it is through his role in the cultural phenomenon “Squid Game” that his international fame has skyrocketed.
“I've experienced Hollywood blockbusters a few times, but being welcomed overseas for performing in Korean while acting alongside Korean colleagues feels completely different,” he said. “It's ironic yet deeply moving that I'm receiving more recognition for Korean works than for Hollywood films,” he added.
“As an actor, I always thought the ideal life would be to be somewhat known wherever I am. After filming ‘G.I. Joe,’ I thought, 'From now on, I'm far from having a moderately famous life; I'll become very famous.' I thought that a few times after, but when I went overseas, no one recognized me,” Lee laughed.
“But this time, it feels real. I feel like I'll live as a well-known person for the time being,” he said.",leebyunghun,5.0,"The article is entirely focused on Lee Byung-hun, discussing his major role as Frontman in Squid Game Season 2, his challenges in portraying multiple identities within the character, and his career trajectory from Korean star to Hollywood actor.

As the new year dawns, Korean cinema finds itself at a precarious crossroads.
The industry, still reeling from the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, faces a dual crisis: Streaming platforms are making theaters increasingly obsolescent, and risk-averse investors are gravitating toward safe bets, with remakes, sequels, and adaptations stacking up one after another. In a telling sign, Korea's five major production houses have barely squeezed out ten projects exceeding the 3-billion-won ($2 million) threshold for 2025.
Yet even despite this industry-wide contraction, Korea's cinematic luminaries are pushing boundaries in unexpected directions. Here's our curated watchlist for 2025:
""Mickey 17""
Director: Bong Joon-ho
Release: March 7, 2025 (US/Canada)
Bong Joon-ho's hotly anticipated follow-up to his Oscar-sweeping ""Parasite"" ventures into uncharted territory, both literally and figuratively. Based on Edward Ashton's 2022 novel ""Mickey7,"" this $150 million Warner Bros blockbuster stars Robert Pattinson as an ""expendable"" space colonist whose self-replicating existence hits a snag when one of his dead versions turns up alive.
The budget alone speaks volumes -- at $150 million, it rivals Christopher Nolan's space epic ""Interstellar"" ($165 million) and stands light-years above most local Korean productions. After a dizzying carousel of release dates through 2024 and 2025, it's finally locked for a March 7 premiere, with Korea getting first dibs before the global rollout.
The work marks Bong's fourth sci-fi foray following ""Snowpiercer"" and ""Okja,"" though casual audiences might not associate him with the genre after ""Parasite's"" down-to-earth satire. Robert Pattinson leads a stellar cast including Steven Yeun, Naomi Ackie, Toni Collette and Mark Ruffalo.
""No Other Choice""
Director: Park Chan-wook
Release: Late 2025
Park Chan-wook, Korea's arthouse darling, returns three years after his widely acclaimed ""Decision to Leave"" with a pitch-black comedy-thriller. Adapting Donald Westlake's 1996 novel ""The Ax"" to a Korean setting, ""No Other Choice"" follows Man-soo (Lee Byung-hun), a laid-off worker whose job hunt takes a murderous turn against his competitors.
The project pairs screen royalty Lee Byung-hun with Son Ye-jin in what promises to be the auteur's signature blend of violence and visual opulence bordering on obsession. Industry whispers suggest a Venice Film Festival bow, though the late-2025 release window might rule out Cannes.
For production financier CJ ENM, the project is a high-stakes bet that lives up to its title. The studio's entire film division reportedly hangs by a thread after a string of expensive post-COVID flops, with ""No Other Choice"" being one of their only two releases for this year.
""Bugonia""
Director: Yorgos Lanthimos
Release: November 7, 2025 (US/Canada)
Korea's wildest cult classic gets a second life through ""Poor Things"" director Yorgos Lanthimos. The 2003 original ""Save the Green Planet"" (directed by Jang Joon-hwan) was a commercial dud that's since achieved legendary status -- an anarchic potpourri of sadistic comedy, alien paranoia, and dark social commentary.
Emma Stone headlines this reworking as a pharmaceutical CEO (gender-swapped from the original) who falls prey to a deranged duo of conspiracy theorists. For Korean cinephiles familiar with the original's unhinged brilliance, anticipation runs absolutely fever-high.
The project represents CJ ENM's strategic pivot toward international remakes, which brings together an impressive coalition: ""Midsommar"" director Ari Aster's Square Peg, Ireland's Element Pictures, and Focus Features handling US distribution on behalf of its parent company Universal Pictures.
""The Match""
Director: Kim Hyung-ju
Release: Early 2025
This long-awaited biopic chronicles the legendary Go rivalry between Cho Hoon-hyun and his protege-turned-rival Lee Chang-ho. Lee Byung-hun portrays the flamboyant Cho while Yoo Ah-in embodies the introverted prodigy Lee, all under Kim Hyung-ju's direction (known for 2017's ""The Sheriff in Town"").
The film's journey to the screens has been nothing short of wretched. Shot in late 2020 and wrapped by April 2021, its release derailed when lead actor Yoo Ah-in faced drug charges that resulted in a one-year prison sentence. Netflix, the original distributor, practically shelved the project after capitulating to Korea's unforgiving stance toward celebrity misconduct.
In an unexpected revival, recent discussions point to a nationwide theatrical release in early 2025. If realized, it would mark Yoo's first screen appearance since his fall from grace. Whether audiences will separate art from artist remains to be seen, especially as Yoo's February appeal verdict looms.
""Revelations""
Director: Yeon Sang-ho
Release: 2025 (On Netflix)
""Train to Busan"" architect Yeon Sang-ho, the streaming age's newest golden boy, continues his Netflix hot streak after ""Jung_E,"" ""Hellbound"" and ""Parasyte: The Grey."" His latest project teams him once again with ""Hellbound"" screenwriter Choi Gyu-seok for an adaptation of their own 2022 webtoon.
The supernatural thriller follows Pastor Min-chan (Ryu Jun-yeol) and Detective Yeon-hee (Shin Hyun-been) investigating a missing person case. When divine revelation points to a suspect, Min-chan's quest for justice blurs lines between faith and vengeance, while Yeon-hee grapples with visions of her murdered sister.
Oscar-winning auteur Alfonso Cuaron joins as executive producer, lending additional prestige to Netflix's relentless expansion into Korea. The streaming giant plans seven Korean features for 2025, spanning action, rom-com and animation -- a seismic shift that signals both opportunity and risk to the industry.
Meanwhile, Yeon's creative engine showcases remarkable range throughout the new year: ""35th Street,"" a collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio's Appian Way, begins production late 2025. Yeon also helms ""Face,"" a lean 200-million-won mystery thriller set for a 2025 release. Shot in just three weeks, this indie project features rising talent Park Jung-min in dual roles as a father and son embroiled in a murder mystery.",leebyunghun,4.0,"The article directly mentions Lee Byung-hun in two significant roles in upcoming 2025 films: as the lead character Man-soo in Park Chan-wook's ""No Other Choice"" and as Cho Hoon-hyun in ""The Match.""

Anchored by Lee Jung-jae’s reprisal of Ki-hun -- a man whose haunting past fuels his return to the blood-soaked battleground -- the new season promises to weave an even more intricate web of suspense and moral dilemmas in pursuit of a fortune that rewards the few who endure.
The cultural juggernaut’s sophomore outing arrives with a Golden Globe nomination for best drama already under its belt — a rare accolade for a series yet to premiere.
As the show lands just in time to brighten the peak holiday season, here’s a primer for newcomers and a glimpse into the mysteries that may await resolution.
Ki-hun’s Personal Life
In the first season, Ki-hun’s journey begins as a portrait of despair.
Divorced and drowning in gambling debt that leads him to signing away his body to loan sharks, he lived with his ailing mother while grappling with the fallout of his divorce.
Despite emerging victorious in the games and claiming the staggering cash prize, Ki-hun’s triumph was anything but celebratory. Haunted by the trauma, Ki-hun turns his focus to confronting the shadowy figures orchestrating the deadly competition.
As season two unfolds, questions linger: What becomes of Ki-hun’s personal life? How will his fractured relationships and lingering guilt shape his actions this time?
Deadly Games
Season one’s games offered a twisted blend of childhood nostalgia and brutal survivalism. Following is a refresher on the challenges that gripped audiences in season one.
Red Light, Green Light: Players had to freeze when prompted, or face instant elimination by a motion-sensing animatronic doll.
Sugar Honeycomb: Participants carved shapes out from fragile honeycomb candy, with failure resulting in death.
Tug-of-War: The team-based game required opposing sides to pull on a rope, aiming to drag the central marker across their line to claim victory.
Marbles: The game involved pairs of players competing against each other to win all of their opponent's marbles, using any agreed-upon rules, with the loser eliminated.
Glass Bridge: Participants had to take leaps of faith across glass panels, which randomly shattered under pressure.
Squid Game: The titular finale demanded one to navigate offensive and defensive roles to reach the head of the court shaped like a squid and tap it with their foot to win.
Director Hwang Dong-hyuk has hinted that season two will raise the stakes with even more creative and intense challenges. The official trailer revealed a new location for one of the games -- a Ferris wheel -- and viewers may expect games that test the limits of horror and psychological depth in the upcoming season.
Voting System
Season one unveiled a rule allowing participants to end the games if the majority agreed. Initially, players voted to leave after witnessing the carnage of the first game, only to return, driven by the despair of their lives outside the arena.
According to Hwang, the voting system will play a crucial role in season two. However, details about how the system will evolve and how it might significantly impact the storyline — something it did not do so much in the first season — remain unknown.
Will the system evolve? How will the votes impact the course of the games and the story of the second season of ""Squid Game""?
The Frontman and Jun-ho’s Relationship
Season one ended with a shocking revelation that the enigmatic Frontman (Lee Byung-hun), who oversees the deadly games, was Jun-ho’s estranged older brother. Jun-ho (Wi Ha-joon) is a determined police officer who infiltrated the games to uncover their secrets.
In a dramatic turn, at the end of the season the Frontman shoots Jun-ho, sending him plummeting off a cliff.
Season two teases at Jun-ho’s survival and his potential return, setting the stage for an exploration of family ties, justice and dark forces behind the games.
What role will Jun-ho play in the upcoming season? Will he join forces with those such as Ki-hun that try to make their way into the deadly games?

While the attempt, fortunately, had failed, one might expect better planning for such a flagrant assault on the country's democratic institutions. The bizarrely amateurish and poorly thought out execution has sparked renewed questions about the president's judgment, including whispers about his notorious drinking habits.
But perhaps that's politics in a nutshell: mythology from afar and farce up close. Strip away the veneer of distance, and you're left with something far more shallow — surprisingly inept individuals revealing their self-serving nature in moments of pressure. For those seeking perspective on power's inherent absurdity, these three Korean films offer particularly relevant viewing.
""The President's Last Bang"" (2005)
""The President's Last Bang"" turns the assassination of ruthless strongman Park Chung-hee into something approaching workplace satire. Unlike ""The Man Standing Next"" (2020), which offers a solemn historical treatment of the same event, director Im Sang-soo strips away all pretense to expose the ludicrous pettiness beneath.
The seemingly invincible dictatorship collapses under the weight of human pettiness and cowardice. Cabinet members fumble through the president's final hours like clowns, their corridors of power ringing with desperation rather than resolve. High officials alternate between playing tough guy while the president's back is turned, and cowering in bathrooms as they beg for their lives. The film's genius lies in presenting these mythologized figures of history as small and shallow — less tragic heroes, more confused human beings caught in their own game.
""Masquerade"" (2012)
""Masquerade"" approaches political theater through historical fiction, with director Choo Chang-min crafting a light-hearted yet pointed fable. When the throne of Joseon needs a body double, a lowly jester (Lee Byung-hun) ends up wearing the crown.
The humor emerges from watching the ceremonial court order crash against the fake king's down-to-earth pragmatism. The film's satire cuts deeper as the jester's common sense repeatedly outshines aristocratic formalities. By showing how easily an uneducated commoner can perform — and improve upon — the role of the supposedly divine monarch, ""Masquerade"" reveals ornate ritual as empty performance, power as merely well-rehearsed theater.
""Inside Men"" (2015)
""Inside Men"" drags political farce into modern Korea's shadowy lounges and smoke-filled back offices. Here, corporate executives, journalists and politicians engage in what amounts to picaresque comedy, each a caricature of amoral ambition. Director Woo Min-ho finds bitter humor in their savage power plays, watching supposed masters of the universe brazenly frame naked self-interest as patriotic duty.
The film's most memorable line, where elites dismiss the masses as ""dogs and pigs"" -- a phrase that has become a staple in Korean political commentary ever since -- feels less like satire with each passing news cycle. Even the film's violence carries a streak of dark comedy, with sophisticated power brokers devolving into blood-soaked vendettas.",leebyunghun,4.0,"Lee Byung-hun is directly mentioned as the lead actor in ""Masquerade"" (2012), where he plays a dual role as both a jester and a king's body double.

""From my perspective, people are drawing lines, becoming hostile toward one another, and such conflicts seem to be deepening globally,"" Hwang Dong-hyuk, director of the first and second seasons of ""Squid Game,"" said during a press conference held on Monday in Jung-gu, Seoul.
""I hope it provides an opportunity for us to reflect on our society, our surroundings and the world we live in once again,"" Hwang said.
He highlighted a key difference between the first and second seasons of ""Squid Game"": The introduction of a voting system that allows the participants to decide whether to continue or leave the game.
According to him, the voting system provides audiences with a chance for further reflection on current global events.
""Lately, there’s been a lot of talk about voting, and considering the current situation — not just in Korea but globally, as the United States recently wrapped up its presidential election — it’s interesting to think about how voting connects with the real world. It offers plenty of intriguing points for reflection,"" said Hwang.
Regarding the participants in the new season, Hwang noted a significant shift in their demographics, with younger individuals playing a more prominent role. He explained that this decision was intentional, reflecting broader societal changes.
""When I was writing Season One, I thought that for someone to accumulate this level of debt and participate in such a game, they would likely need to be somewhat older. I assumed it wasn’t possible to experience such significant social failures at a young age,"" said Hwang.
However, he said, a series of global events, including the pandemic and the cryptocurrency boom, led him to reconsider.
""I noticed that younger generations were gradually giving up on the idea of earning money through labor and were instead turning to activities like stock trading or cryptocurrency investments, chasing quick, massive gains,"" he said.
""This led me to think that Season Two could explore the issues and realities faced by younger generations,"" Hwang explained.
Lee Byung-hun, who reprises his role as the enigmatic Front Man, commented on the complexity of the production of ""Squid Game 2.""
""In Season Two, there are truly so many key characters, and because of this, their interconnected relationships and the continuous storyline required careful consideration. I’m certain it was a much more complex and mentally challenging process compared to other works,"" said Lee.
He also praised the precision of the filming process, saying, ""It was impressive to see how everything was so meticulously calculated, with everyone clearly knowing exactly what needed to be filmed, and then shooting only what was necessary. Watching that made me think how remarkable it all was.""
Several Netflix executives were also present at Monday's press conference, including Marianne Lee, chief marketing officer of Netflix, who commented on the power of Korean content.
""When I speak with my Korean family and friends, I feel their immense pride in seeing Korea at the heart of global culture,"" said Lee.
""I am proud that we have Korean executives in top positions at Netflix, championing these unique local stories and bringing them to life,"" she added.
According to Lee, the teaser for ""Squid Game 2"" quickly became Netflix's most-viewed teaser of 2024 and the number one trending video on YouTube upon its release.
Kim Min-young, vice president of content for Asia (ex-India) at Netflix, added that ""over 80 percent of Netflix members worldwide are currently watching Korean content.""

On Wednesday, Netflix unveiled the main trailer for ""Squid Game 2"" on its official YouTube channel. The 108-second video showcases never-before-seen footage, including a haunting glimpse of the Ferris wheel, which is seen bloodstained, as contestants scramble desperately to survive. The trailer begins with new characters receiving invitations marked with the game's iconic circle, triangle and square symbols. Ki-hun (Lee Jung-jae), the protagonist of the first season and the sole survivor of the 33rd Squid Game, appears in a mysterious limousine, where he encounters the ominous voice of the Front Man (Lee Byung-hun). Declaring, ""Put me back in the game,"" Ki-hun voluntarily returns to the brutal competition he barely escaped last time. The conflict intensifies as Ki-hun boldly declares, ""I'm trying to put an end to this game,"" putting him at odds with the Front Man, who counters ominously, ""The game will not end unless the world changes."" Their clash of ideologies hints at a gripping confrontation between them. The trailer also features new scenes, including new cast members Im Si-wan and Park Gyu-young receiving their invitations, and Ki-hun rallying participants to rebel against the creators of the death games. Familiar horrors return as well, including the chilling Young-hee doll, which ruthlessly eliminates contestants who dare to move during the notorious motion-sensing game. Anticipation for the sequel has been further stoked by revelations from the teaser released on Sept. 20. Slowing the teaser to 0.25x speed, Front Man, played by Lee Byung-hun, could be spotted disguised in the same uniform as the other participants and blending in within the dormitory.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3252835,[Kim Seong-kon] What we can learn from 'Terminator Genisys',2023-11-08,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/11/07/20231107000753_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"The 1991 American science fiction film, “Terminator 2: Judgment Day,” teaches us one valuable lesson: “Appearances are deceiving.” In the movie, a man in a police uniform is, in fact, a T-1000 advanced cyborg that is a ruthless killing machine. Conversely, the man dressed like a motorcycle gangster, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, is a good cyborg whose mission is to protect John Connor, the future leader of the human resistance against the Artificial Intelligence that tries to annihilate human civilization. Due to their outfits, however, people are confused and liable to mistake their identities. Moreover, in the 1984 prequel, “The Terminator,” the model 101 cyborg, played by Schwarzenegger, was an evil humanoid replica who tried to kill Sarah, mother of John Connor. Thus, viewers of “Terminator 2” might naturally assume that the 101 model in the sequel is malicious. In that sense, “Terminator 2” opens our eyes to the complex reality that there are many wolves in sheep's clothing and vice versa in our society. Another lesson we can learn from “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” is that good cyborgs can be better than humans. Indeed, unlike human beings, machines never betray or neglect their duty. It never becomes whimsical or unreliable, either. Watching the Model 101 take care of her son, Sarah realizes that the machine is a perfect father, whereas the boy’s human father is a sheer disappointment. Furthermore, when and if a humanoid with “deep learning” capabilities develops emotions, the difference between man and machine becomes blurry and a cyborg can even excel humans. Indeed, at the end of “Terminator 2: Judgment Day,” the Model 101 cyborg proves it by sacrificing his life in order to save human civilization. By contrast, the 2015 film “Terminator: Genisys” is a powerful, eye-opening movie because it warns us of the danger of AI becoming wayward and unruly. It depicts the grim future of a world controlled and governed by the artificial intelligence called Skynet. Initially, scientists created Skynet for peaceful purposes. Gradually, however, Skynet begins thinking on its own and considers humans to be harmful enemies that it must eliminate. In “Terminator: Genisys,” Skynet takes over the world in 2017 through the program called Genisys, a global operating system through which all the people on Earth are connected. To stop the threat, the protagonists of the film have to go back in time to 2017 to prevent Genisys from ever going online. The movie shows us the familiar scene of people eagerly looking into their smartphones everywhere, not knowing that some invisible force may be controlling and manipulating them. Watching the scene, we realize that we all are connected online through social media these days. “Terminator: Genisys” also teaches us that a man could have two contradictory identities and we should carefully discern them. In the movie, for example, two identical looking T-800/Model 101 Terminators, one sent by Skynet to 1984 to kill Sarah and the other sent to 1973 to protect Sarah by an unknown party, are fighting each other. Appropriately, Schwarzenegger plays the two ostensibly identical, but radically different Model 101 Terminators, one young and the other old. Perhaps it could be a metaphor for the generation war between the old and the young. It could also symbolize the self-contradictory lives of our politicians who preach socialism for political gain while brazenly savoring the benefits of capitalism. Another lesson we can learn from “Terminator: Genisys” is that we should be very careful about trusting our political leaders, no matter how trustworthy and reliable they may appear. In 2029, John Connor, the leader of the human resistance, launches a final offensive against Skynet. At that very moment, Skynet attacks him and turns him into an advanced cyborg. People call John “the last hope of humanity.” Now John has become an agent for Skynet and does not even hesitate to kill his own parents in order to protect the evil AI system. By presenting this appalling situation, “Terminator Genisys” reminds us that our political leaders also can be the agents of the very tyrannical machine they have been fighting or that they may come to resemble the machine they once detested. Watching the movie, we come to realize that the same idea may apply to our politicians who fought against tyranny in the past, only to now ironically resemble the dictators they once hated. “Terminator Genisys” presents an unnerving reality in which we do not know who to trust. Indeed, we are now living in a complex world where nothing is certain and appearances are deceiving. The liquid, shape-shifting T-1000 cyborg played superbly by Lee Byung-hun is a good metaphor for it. Yet, we are still mindlessly indulging in smartphones, connected by various social media platforms, often believing fake news as truth, not realizing that someone, human or AI, is controlling and manipulating us from behind. “Terminator Genisys” warns us to awaken and be alert.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3183740,[Herald Review] Dystopian black comedy ‘Concrete Utopia’ has questions instead of message,2023-08-03,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/08/03/20230803000659_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"When it comes to ‘living in an apartment,’ or specifically ‘owning an apartment,’ many Koreans perceive that differently from simply having a place to live. An apartment could be someone’s life goal or another’s deep grudge. In that context, “Concrete Utopia” raises questions about the contradictions humans face when put in extreme situations -- such as when your apartment building becomes the only place in Seoul that has survived a devastating earthquake. Director Um Tae-hwa’s “Concrete Utopia” is a dark, black comedy disaster thriller that tells the story of apartment residents whose homes threaten their lives. Residents of Hwanggung Apartment building No. 103, the only building that has survived a destructive earthquake, initially see their building as a ""utopia,"" but that thought simply signals the beginning of a dystopia as non-residents start to flock to the building. Calling non-residents who have sneaked into the building ""cockroaches,"" residents of Hwanggung Apartment gather together to protect their utopian home from non-residents. At the center is Kim Young-tak (Lee Byung-hun), who would be willing even to die if there is anything he can do to protect his home and the building. In exchange for such passion and willingness to sacrifice himself, he is elected to represent the apartment building residents, wielding enormous power among the residents. Next to him is Min-sung (Park Seo-joon), a reliable, seemingly good-hearted neighbor who supports Young-tak in many ways to keep things in order and establish a system amidst the chaos as food and water become scarce. But Myung-hwa (Park Bo-young), the wife of Min-sung, doesn’t like how the residents of Hwanggung Apartment kick out the non-residents who will otherwise starve or freeze to death in the extremely cold weather outside. At one point, she notices that Young-tak shouldn’t be trusted. The movie asks the audience whether you would do the same if your home were the only place to survive a colossal disaster and non-residents were to flood in. It is unclear which decision is the wisest, as that question is left unanswered even after the film's 129-minute running time. One can't tell whether the unsettled feeling after the film is simply due to the genre’s characteristics as a dystopian flick. “Concrete Utopia” doesn’t simply show Koreans’ fantasies about owning an apartment or the loss of humanity in extreme situations. Rather, it invites discussion about humans' problematic desires and behaviors, including: greed, discrimination, the desire for power and human-made hierarchies. Park Seo-joon and Park Bo-young show well-balanced acting, firmly supporting Lee Byung-hun, who once again fantastically portrays a complex, multi-dimensional character as the story unfolds. Director Um’s clever opening sequence showing what apartments mean in Korean society elevates the audience’s understanding of the film’s tone and style, making the film’s topic accessible and relatable to moviegoers anywhere. The film has been invited to various international film festivals including the 48th Toronto International Film Festival, and will open in 152 countries. “Concrete Utopia” opens in local theaters on Aug. 9.",leebyunghun,5.0,"The article is highly relevant to Lee Byung-hun as he plays the central character Kim Young-tak in ""Concrete Utopia.""

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3170434,Top film distributors compete with summer blockbusters,2023-07-16,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2023/07/16/20230716000245_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"NEW, Showbox, CJENM, Lotte Entertainment gear up for releases but there are risks to their success Four new blockbusters are set to hit local cinemas this summer, complete with large production budgets and star-studded lineups. Film distributors hope to attract large audiences in the aftermath of the pandemic, but moviegoers' expectations remain low. With the abundance of high quality content available on streaming platforms and soaring ticket prices, Korean audiences have shown a growing trend of consuming content at home, only venturing to cinemas if the ticket is truly worth the price. It remains to be seen whether struggling film distributors will find success with their upcoming summer releases. First on the list of new films this summer is director Ryoo Seung-wan’s crime action flick “Smugglers,” distributed by NEW. With a production budget of around 20 billion won ($15.8 million), the film tells the story of the residents of a peaceful seaside town, many of whom are involved in smuggling. Director Ryoo’s flagship sense of humor and the film's star-studded lineup -- Kim Hye-soo, Yum Jung-ah, Zo In-sung, Park Jung-min, Go Min-si -- are expected to attract moviegoers. However, some speculate that the film will be yet another cliche crime flick, mimicking “The Thieves” (2012), only this time with a female-led cast. The film opens in cinemas on July 26. Next on the list is “Ransomed,” directed by Kim Seong-hoon, featuring Ha Jung-woo and Ju Ji-hoon, a familiar duo from “Along with the Gods.” “Ransomed” revolves around the story of a diplomat, Min-jun (Ha), and a local taxi driver, Pan-su (Ju), in Lebanon. Their mission is to rescue a fellow diplomat. The film is Ha’s first silver screen work after he was fined 30 million won in 2021 for illegal use of propofol in 2019, violating South Korea's Narcotics Control Act. Some 20 billion won has been injected into the project, which involved a 6 month-long shoot in Morocco and includes realistic car chasing scenes, according to the distributor Showbox. Chemistry between the actors and the director is somewhat guaranteed as director Kim worked with Ha on the 2016 thriller “Tunnel,” and with Ju for the Netflix hit series “Kingdom."" However, negative public sentiment over the increasing incidence of celebrity drug scandals may hamper the success of Kim's work. The film is set to open on Aug. 2. Third on the list is “The Moon,” which will be distributed by CJENM, whose film business has struggled in recent years. The SF adventure “The Moon” had a production budget of about 28 billion won. Helmed by “Along with the Gods” director Kim Yong-hwa, the film features singer and actor Doh Kyung-soo, who plays an astronaut, Seon-woo, who is abandoned on the other side of the moon. Sol Kyung-gu and Kim Hee-ae appear in the film as characters embroiled in an emotional tug-of-war over whether they should save Seon-woo or not. The film’s scale, detailed set design and sophisticated use of computer graphics are key points of anticipation for audiences. However, Korean sci-fi flicks have generally been unpopular -- “Space Sweepers” (2021), “Seo Bok” (2021) and “Jung_E” (2022) all failed to attract moviegoers. Coupled with Korean audiences' growing fatigue and sense of deja vu over the slew of Hollywood space survival flicks like ""Gravity"" (2013) and ""Interstellar"" (2014), the film's upcoming success may not be guaranteed. ""The Moon"" opens on Aug. 2. Last on the list is “Concrete Utopia.” Based on the second part of the hit webtoon series “Pleasant Neighbor,” the film tells the story of apartment residents whose lives are in danger in the aftermath of an earthquake. The film had a production budget of 20 billion won. Director Um Tae-hwa portrays Lee Byung-hun, Park Seo-joon and Park Bo-young as desperate residents fighting to survive in their partially collapsed apartment. Although the plot line may be relatable to our everyday lives, as many Koreans spend a lot of time in their apartments, not many webtoon-inspired films have had much success here. There is also the risk that this kind of disaster flick often concludes with a predictable, melodramatic ending. The film, which is distributed by Lotte Entertainment, hits cinemas on Aug. 9.",leebyunghun,4.0,"The article directly mentions Lee Byung-hun as one of the main stars in ""Concrete Utopia,"" one of the major summer blockbusters discussed.

The film -- based on the second part of a webtoon about an earthquake and its aftermath, “Pleasant Neighbor” -- tells the story of apartment residents whose homes threaten their lives. Focusing on depicting the reality of an apartment complex in Seoul destroyed in a large earthquake, the production team spent five months to build a life-sized, three-story apartment building for the filming. The interiors of the apartment units were custom-designed to show the characteristics and jobs of each character that Lee Byung-hun, Park Seo-joon and Park Bo-young play. They star as a group of residents in the Hwang Gung Apartments. Lee plays Young-tak, a leader among the residents, Park Seo-joon stars as Min-seong, who supports Young-tak, and Park Bo-young plays Min-seong’s wife. Sophisticated computer graphics were also used to show the contrast between Seoul before and after the devastating earthquake. Production company Climax Studio, which produced hit Netflix originals “Hellbound” and “D.P.,” participated in the film. Realistic, detailed set design was pivotal for the film as it is not just about the aftermath of a disaster but shows different sides of human instincts when put in an extreme situation, according to director Um. “It was important for me to add reality to the film sets. It took two years for the computer graphics team to study the geography of Seoul and apply it to the computer graphics work,” said Um during a press conference held on June 21.

The movie is based on the second part of a webtoon about an earthquake and its aftermath, “Pleasant Neighbor.” Lee Byung-hun, Park Seo-joon and Park Bo-young star as few residents of Hwang Gung Apartments in the devastated city. Lee plays Young-tak, a leader among the residents, Park Seo-joon as Min-seong who supports Young-tak and Park Bo-young as Min-seong’s wife. “I was attracted to the original story’s unique background set in an apartment where many of us live and spend so much time. It was fun for me to imagine how a familiar place can turn extremely dangerous,” Um said during a press conference at Lotte Cinema Konkuk University in Seoul on Wednesday. Lee Byung-hun, who has starred in several disaster thrillers, said this movie was about more than just surviving a disaster. “In a typical disaster film, the main plot revolves around the disaster. This film, however, delves more into how residents cope with the disaster and how they communicate in an extreme environment,” said Lee, adding that the film was more like a black comedy. “Just by looking at the people living in the apartment, there are so many different types of people. So the main plot begins with a disaster but the film shows more than that, and that’s why I chose to appear in this movie even after working on disaster thriller films like ‘Ashfall’ and ‘Emergency Declaration,’” said Lee. Park Seo-joon and Park Bo-young said the biggest reason for choosing “Concrete Utopia” was the cast. “Not just because I wanted to show different a aspect of my acting spectrum, I’ve been a huge fan of Lee and I’ve always wanted the chance to do a project with him,” Park told reporters, adding that he reached out to the director first even before the project was suggested to him. “Concrete Utopia” is also Park Bo-young’s first film in five years. “I read the scenario and told my agency that I have to do this project. I really wanted this project because the movie was something that I can show different acting compared to my previous ones,” Park said, adding that she also asked to be part of the project.

It took two years for the computer graphics team to study the geography of Seoul and apply it to the CG work,” said director Um. “Because every detail is well-depicted in the film sets, all I had to do was immerse myself into the setting and just act,” said Park Seo-joon. Kim Sun-young (“Reply 1988,” “Crash Landing On You”) and Park Ji-hou (“All of Us Are Dead”) and Kim Do-yoon (“Hellbound”) also star as residents of Hwang Gung Apartment.

Hwang Ki-hwan had been buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in New York after dying alone in 1923. A century after his death, his remains arrived at Incheon Airport early on Monday morning after a 15-hour flight. Honor guards carried Hwang’s casket, which was covered with a South Korean national flag, during the repatriation ceremony starting at 9 a.m. South Korean Minister of Patriots and Veterans Affairs Park Min-shik and descendants of Korean independence fighters paid tribute to the deceased patriot while a song was played to honor him. “After 100 years, patriot Hwang Ki-hwan has finally returned to his homeland today. When thinking about his whole life dedicated to fighting for independence, I am truly sorry for the time of 100 years,” Park said Monday in a written message. “I hope that he can now rest in peace in the embrace of his proud homeland, which has risen on the world stage.” Hwang was interred in the national cemetery in Daejeon on Monday afternoon. The patriot had South Korean nationality conferred to him before the burial ceremony. Hwang had been stateless as he had no direct descendants in South Korea and left Korea before the Japanese Empire enacted Chosun Civil Codes in 1912, which the South Korean government used as the standard to grant nationality after liberation. The Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs put in a decade of strenuous efforts since 2013 to bring back his remains to South Korea. The New York cemetery had called for a local court’s approval due to the absence of Hwang’s family members. The ministry failed to obtain approval from the local court twice in 2019 and 2022 due to the lack of official records to confirm that he had no living family. But the cemetery gave the green light in January to repatriate Hwang’s remains to South Korea. Hwang, whose English name is Earl K. Whang, devoted his whole life to restoring Korea’s sovereignty from Japanese colonial rule and telling the world about Japanese atrocities while traveling around France, the United States and the United Kingdom. Hwang’s interviews, in which he claimed the legitimacy of Korean independence, were featured in the international press, including the New York Herald and the Chicago Tribune. Born in 1886 in Sunchon, South Pyongan Province, now in North Korea, Hwang moved to the United States in 1904 to study. Then he volunteered to fight for the US in 1918 during World War I and rescued wounded soldiers on the front lines in Europe. After the war, he moved to France in 1919 and engaged in the Korean independence movement. Hwang supported Kim Kyu-sik, then-foreign minister of the Korean Provisional Government in exile in Shanghai, who stayed in France to attend the Paris Peace Conference convened in January 1919 at Versailles, just outside Paris, to lobby for Korean independence. Hwang published a monthly magazine, dubbed La Coree Libre, in French and distributed it to news organizations, government officials and scholars. Hwang also mustered support for the Korean independence movement in the UK. Along with Frederick Arthur McKenzie, he led efforts to establish the League of Friends of Korea in London in support of Korean independence in late October 1920. McKenzie was a journalist whose reporting and writing during the early 20th century helped expose Koreans’ suffering under the rule of Imperial Japan. Hwang later moved to the US to attend the Washington Conference in the early 1920s and continue his fight for Korean independence and protect the rights of overseas Koreans. He died of a heart attack in New York. The South Korean government awarded him with the Order of Merit of National Foundation and Patriotism Award, posthumously recognizing his contribution toward the Korean independence movement. His grave was found at the West Lawn of Mount Olivet Cemetery in 2008, 85 years after his death, as he was unmarried and had no bereaved family members. His life came to wider attention thanks to “Mr. Sunshine,” a historical drama that aired in 2018. The Korean patriot was depicted as Eugene Choi, a Korean-born US military officer, played by Korean actor Lee Byung-hun.

The Korean patriot, whose English name was Earl K. Whang, inspired the drama series' producers to create the character Eugene Choi (played by Lee Byung-hun), a Korean American US Marine Corps officer who returns to Korea and ends up helping his compatriots thwart a looming Japanese invasion in the beginning of the 20th century. Starring Kim Tae-ri as the female protagonist opposite Lee, the show was a huge success when it premiered locally on tvN and internationally on Netflix. The Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs said on Wednesday that it has agreed with Mount Olivet Cemetery in Queens, New York, to exhume Whang’s body. The ministry had tried to bring back the remains to Korea since 2013, but the cemetery insisted on a court order to exhume the body without his family’s approval. The ministry filed lawsuits with the New York court in 2019 and last year, but failed to obtain court approval for lack of official records to confirm that Whang had no living family. Together with the Korean consulate general in New York, the ministry continued to push the cemetery to grant Koreans the wish to bring the patriot back to his motherland, and recently got the go-ahead. Once Whang’s remains land in South Korea, he will be buried at the Daejeon National Cemetery after a government-led ceremony. Born in Suncheon, South Pyongan Province, which is now in North Korea, Whang went to the US in 1904 in his late teens. He voluntarily joined the US Army when the US declared its participation in the World War I in 1917, and rescued wounded soldiers on the front lines in Europe. In June 1919, Whang moved to France and helped the Korean Representative to the Paris Peace Conference at the suggestion of its head, Kim Kyu-shik, who was in charge of international affairs for the Korean government in exile in Shanghai at that time, and became vice president of the interim government in 1943. The Korean Representative was later reorganized as the Korean Committee, and Whang was appointed its secretary-general. Whang led the committee in France after Kim went to the US in August, and engaged in diplomatic efforts for Korea’s independence, or what he called a “transfer of the sovereignty Japan has robbed from us to the Korean exile government."" In October 1919, Whang persuaded the British government not to repatriate Korean laborers who arrived in Britain from Murmansk, Russia, and helped 35 of them settle in France. In January 1920, Whang published a French-language magazine titled La Coree Libre, and distributed it to news organizations, government officials and scholars in Europe. After serving at the committee for about two years, Whang was called to the US by Syngman Rhee, who was then preparing for the Washington Conference in November 1921. Rhee became the first president of South Korea in 1948. Whang died of a heart attack in New York in 1923. His grave was found by Koreans in 2008 at the West Lawn of Mount Olivet Cemetery.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2984755,"[Newsmaker] Depression, panic disorder fester in Korea as social stigma persists",2022-10-24,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/10/24/20221024000182_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Two-hundred and fifty-six. That's the number of people between age 10 and 20 that took their lives due to mental health problems last year. Of a total 13,205 deaths by suicide in 2021, some 5,258 had histories of mental health treatment, according to police data provided by Rep. Oh Young-hwan of the main opposition Democratic Party. The same data shows that the number of suicides aged 10-29 age groups jumped each year from 2019, with the figure for the latter marking 888 as of 2021. The figures indicate that growing number of young people in Korea are suffering from mental illness, with increasingly fatal results. Suicide was the No. 1 cause of death among people under 30 in 2021, according to the Statistics Korea. With the media talking more about panic disorder and depression, particularly related to celebrities suffering from it, awareness against the hazards of mental problems is rising among the general public. But stigmatization toward such illness still remain on some level within the Korean society, causing people to miss out on the critical golden hour for treatment. More people suffering from mental issues Actor Lee Byung-hun recently revealed that he had suffered from panic disorder in the past, describing an attack he suffered on a plane headed to the US. A few years ago K-pop star Kang Daniel ceased all work at the height of his popularity due to panic disorder and depression. He later said he felt he was “losing all will to live.” The prevalence of panic disorder or depression has risen steadily in recent years. The number of people treated for depression jumped 35.1 percent from 691,164 in 2017 to 933,481 in 2021, according to the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service. Over the same period the number treated for panic disorder went from 653,694 to 865,108. The data showed a rapid increase among younger Koreans. Depression rose 127.1 percent increase among 20-somethings, 90.2 percent for teens, and 67.3 percent for 30-somethings, while the number treated for panic disorder increased 86.7 percent increase for those in their 20s and 78.5 percent among teens. One of the problems of mental illness is that they often come together, and this can make patients' conditions more severe. Jeon Hong-jun, assistant professor of psychiatry at Konkuk University Medical Center, found in his 2020 study that not only were panic disorder patients more likely to have agoraphobia, having both illnesses was likely to increase patient suffering. “The findings suggest that patients with PDA (panic disorder patients with agoraphobia) experienced more severe panic symptoms, more profound psychiatric comorbidity, and worse illness progression than those with PD (panic disorder patients without agoraphobia),” Jeon wrote. PDA patients were also more likely to be younger at the age of onset, take benzodiazepines for longer periods, and be treated with antipsychotics. Social stigmatization and reluctance toward treatment Despite the surge in mental health treatment, many are still hesitant to seek help, fearing that being treated for mental illness would leave a stain on one’s reputation. Park Jee-eun, professor of psychology at Seoul National University Hospital, recently announced the results of her research on why people avoid help for mental illness, through analysis of 6 million social media messages shared from 2016 to 2019. She said 25.9 percent of the teens avoided going to psychiatrists out of fear that it will affect college entrance, while 14.4 percent were afraid of looking like “a crazy person.” About 22.4 percent of 20-somethings were concerned about the medical records being seen by potential employers. Among those in their 30s and 40s, 22.1 percent said they were concerned their medical records would have negative effects on their insurance policies, while 14.8 percent feared of being labeled crazy. They have grounds for their concern. In August, the National Human Rights Commission of Korea recommended two local insurance companies to allow those being treated for depression to purchase their insurance programs. One company said the person can enter a screening process a year after one had been off medication, while the other company flat-out refused. “My friend advised me to get treatment without the health insurance, saying it would leave a record and leave bad impression for human resources. I didn’t do that, but I didn’t tell my supervisors either,” said a Seoul-based worker in his 30s who recently got treated for depression and panic disorder. Professor Park pointed out the lack of publicly-accessible information on treatment as a reason the general public is hesitant to seeking psychological help. “Experts (in the field of mental health) should approach the public and make efforts to spread the relevant information, from the public’s point of view,” she said. “There is no reason at all for any mystery to exist about psychotherapy.” “Awareness, Attitude and Impact of Perceived Depression in the Workplace in Korea” by the Korean Neuropsychiatric Association shows that there is negative perception toward being treated for mental illness among workers in Korea. Only 31 percent of those diagnosed with depression took days off, while 34 percent of them did not tell their employers or their colleagues of their illness. The researchers asked the respondents -- 1,000 Koreans aged 16-64 who are working -- what they would do if they learned their colleague was suffering from depression, and the leading answer was that they would avoid such conversation (30.2 percent), indicating that talking about mental illness is a sensitive issue for both parties. The researchers also pointed to a study that estimated that depression's impact on productivity at work was more than 10 times worse through presenteeism than absenteeism. In other words, the depressed workers not being treated and performing poorly was a bigger problem than them missing work for mental health reasons . “In order to prevent the lowering of productivity due to presenteeism at Korean workplaces, there should be a sufficient program to detect depression at its early stage, along with proper system to request help and support the patients,” the researchers concluded.",leebyunghun,4.0,"The article directly mentions Lee Byung-hun and uses him as a prominent example of celebrities who have dealt with mental health issues, specifically noting his experience with panic disorder on a plane to the US. While he isn't the main focus of the article, his case is used to illustrate the broader discussion about mental health awareness and stigma in Korean society.",

Change did not happen overnight After director Bong Joon-ho won the Oscar for “Parasite” at the 92nd Academy Awards in 2019, South Korean cinema also brought home two trophies from this year’s Cannes Film Festival -- best director for Park Chan-wook of “Decision to Leave” and best actor for Song Kang-ho of “Broker.”　 These award-winning films and actors did not appear out of thin air. Korean film’s history of overseas expansion began around the early 2000s, when “Shiri”(1999) directed by Kang Je-kyu became a box office hit in Japan. Around that time, director Im Kwon-taek’s “ChunHyang” (2000) became the first South Korean film to be selected to compete for Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Around 2010, major Korean directors who gained global recognition expanded their global fanbase further by doing projects in the US with Hollywood star actors. Park Chan-wook who won the Grand Prix for “Oldboy” (2003) at the 2004 Cannes and the Jury Prize for “Thirst” (2009) at the 2009 Cannes, presented his English-language debut film “Stoker” starring actors Mia Wasikowska and Nicole Kidman in 2013. Star director Kim Jee-woon also made his US debut with the action thriller “The Last Stand” featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger in the lead in 2013. Before creating this film, Kim gained worldwide recognition through the horror film “A Tale of Two Sisters”(2003), the actioner “The Good, The Bad, The Weird” (2008) and the thriller “I Saw the Devil” (2010). “Parasite” director Bong Joon-ho created his Hollywood debut feature “Snowpiercer” in 2013 as well. The film featured top Hollywood stars Tilda Swinton, Chris Evans and Jamie Bell, along with Song Kang-ho, who also performed in Bong’s “Parasite.” Many Korean actors started joining Hollywood projects around 2010. Veteran Korean actor Lee Byung-hun performed Storm Shadow character in the 2009 picture “G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra.” He also played the same character in its sequel “G.I. Joe: Retaliation” in 2013 In 2015, actor Lee continued his strides in Hollywood by starring in “Terminator: Genesis” as the new villain T-1000. Actor Bae Doo-na’s Hollywood career began with Lana and Andy Wachowski’s “Cloud Atlas” (2012). After the first project, Bae also worked with Wachowski siblings for the film “Jupiter Ascending” (2015) and the Netflix series “Sense 8.”   Still a long way to go? Although many Korean films and actors started getting global recognition, the amount that most Korean films earn from the overseas market is still insignificant. During Lee Jung-jae’s interview, he noted that although his film “Hunt” has been sold to 144 countries, the total earnings from foreign sales of the film are very small, without giving a specific figure. According to KOFIC’s data, the total amount for exports of movies was $43,033,018 last year, a decrease of 20.5 percent from the previous year. The export amount in 2021, which includes both movie-related technology and movie export amount, only accounts for 5.5 percent of the total film industry sales amount, according to the same data. Film critic Jung Ji-wook said this is why some Korean filmmakers are more eager to create a movie that can appeal to mainly local audiences. “If you look at recently released movies like ‘Hansan.’ Its poor Japanese lines clearly show that it is targeted for only Korean audiences,” he said. Jung believes that when filmmakers become too dependent on domestic ticket sales, it can easily lead them to make cliche content. “It can hinder diverse stories from being created, and filmmakers will keep working with the same actors,” he said. However, film industry critic Yoo Tae-hee, also known as YouTuber Tuna, thinks simply trying to increase foreign sales can not be a solution. While increasing the portion of foreign sales can work as a safety net for some movies, it can not improve the quality of Korean movies for the future of our film industry, he said. Yoo added that there are also risks as foreign countries can decide to change import policies. “In particular, in the case of China, the future looks even more uncertain as it can move toward closing its doors ,” he told The Korea Herald. In commemoration of The Korea Herald’s 69th anniversary on Aug. 15, The Korea Herald has prepared a series of features delving into the phenomenon of Korean-made content influencing global contemporary culture and trends. Is it a one-off occurrence or is it here to stay? Can South Korea claim pride in the works of its creative minds as a nation?

""Emergency Declaration,"" a new aviation disaster film released next month, tells a story that everyone living through the pandemic can relate to. The film follows a detective, played by Cannes-winning actor Song Kang-ho, who investigates a suspected terrorist only to find out that he has already boarded a plane. While passengers are trapped inside, those on the ground struggle to find a way to land the plane. ""When confronted by a disaster, humans become weak and scared. They sometimes start accusing and resenting each other. But being human, they also make different choices. ... I tried to focus on our humanity which can overcome dire situations,"" said director Han Jae-rim during a press conference held on Monday. ""A disaster, however small or catastrophic, can come to anyone at any time,"" Song added. ""In such cases, we are reminded of what we value the most. We start to appreciate things we took for granted, like family and neighbors."" Han and big-name actors Song, Lee Byung-hun, Jeon Do-yeon, Kim Nam-gil, Yim Si-wan, Kim So-jin and Park Hae-joon attended the press conference at Megabox Coex in southern Seoul that followed the screening. Joining Song onscreen is another Cannes-winning actor Jeon. The two previously worked together in “Secret Sunshine” (2007). Playing the role of a minister for Land, Infrastructure and Transport, Jeon said her character also struggles to fight off the invisible terror and human frailty. ""Although I was a high government official, I was just another human being like any other character. I also felt helpless dealing with an unprecedented terrorism disaster,” Jeon said. Another notable character is a mysterious passenger, played by Yim Si-wan. Regarding the casting, the director said he started with the idea of someone who viewers wouldn't imagine committing such an act of terrorism. ""I felt 'free' in expressing and portraying this character. So I was more excited than worried about the role,"" said Yim. To convey a realistic-looking setting and dynamic turbulence of the plane in flight, the director used a giant gimbal to rotate the plane 360 degrees -- with the passengers inside. ""Two photography directors actually rode the gimbal and tied themselves to film the passengers’ faces and emotions. I think that‘s how we captured the moment of extreme tension,"" said Han. Kim Nam-gil, who plays the airplane’s pilot, added that he put in extra effort to look like a veteran pilot. ""All the pilots in the film trained together. I practiced landing simulation, piloting and controlling all the buttons. I wanted to look real in the cockpit."" The film was invited to the non-competition section at last year's Cannes Film Festival, where it premiered. Its initial release was delayed due to the pandemic.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2910618,Korean blockbusters offer immersive cinematic experience this summer,2022-07-12,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2022/07/12/20220712000377_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Korean blockbusters will hit local theaters this summer in diverse “immersive cinema” formats to attract more moviegoers, as COVID-19 restrictions for theaters have been lifted. Previously, special-format Imax theaters were considered the near-exclusive domain of Hollywood blockbusters such as Marvel Studios’ superhero movies. The Korean movie industry had practically shunned the format. Until recently, only six Korean commercial films had been released in the Imax format. “Sector 7” (2011) was the first Korean movie to be screened in Imax, followed by “Along With the Gods: The Last 49 Days” (2018), “Exit” (2019), the Oscar-winning “Parasite” (2019), “Peninsula” (2020) and last year’s hit “Escape From Mogadishu.” By contrast, this year has seen “The Pirates: The Last Royal Treasure” and “The Roundup” released in the Imax format, to be followed by two more -- “Alienoid” and “Emergency Declaration” -- in the coming weeks. “After the COVID-19 pandemic, the trend has somewhat shifted. The audience seems to prefer an experience that can only be gained in movie theaters that are different from watching movies at home or online,” an official from CJ CGV, the country’s largest cinema chain, told The Korea Herald on Monday. “Immersive cinema screenings like Imax and 4DX offer an expanded sense of space which allows the audience to be ‘immersed’ -- visually, audibly and even physically -- in the scene,” the official added. According to data from the Korean Film Council, the percentage of Imax viewers in Korea increased to 1.7 percent of all theatergoers last month,from 1 percent in June 2019, before the pandemic. Imax tickets typically cost 22,000 won ($16) per person on weekends in Seoul-area theaters, compared to 15,000 won for regular screenings.　 One of the most highly anticipated movies this season is sci-fi action film “Alienoid,” directed by Choi Dong-hoon, whose recent hits include “The Thieves” (2012) and “Assassination” (2015). Set to be released July 20 in Imax and 4DX, the film’s star-studded cast includes Kim Tae-ri, Kim Woo-bin, Ryu Jun-yeol and So Ji-sub. “The movie depicts two parallel worlds, going back and forth between the past and the present. We hope the audience can fully experience the dynamic action and sound, as if you were in the actual movie, through Imax and 4DX screenings,” said an official at CJ ENM, the film’s distributor. Another historical war blockbuster,“Hansan,” which will be released July 27, is to be available in 4DX. Directed by Kim Han-min, the movie revolves around Adm. Yi Sun-sin and his historic Battle of Hansan Island in 1592 against Japan during the Joseon era. Kim’s previous “Roaring Currents” (2014) remains the reigning champion of Korea’s box office history, selling 17.6 million tickets in a nation of some 51 million. “Emergency Declaration,” scheduled for an August release, will also be screened in Imax, 4DX, Screen X and 4DX Screen, a format that combines 4DX and Screen X. Starring Song Kang-ho from “Parasite,” Lee Byung-hun and Jeon Do-yeon, the movie depicts a deadly virus spreading inside a plane in flight. The audience can experience the film’s action through moving seats along with environmental effects such as water, wind and scent in 4DX. Screen X shows the movie in three facades, using the left and right walls of the theater as additional screens. CJ CGV developed the two technologies. The Imax technology was developed by Imax Corp., which also controls distribution at Imax-affiliated theaters. “The pandemic has changed the demands from our audience, and we think that ‘Emergency Declaration’ is the perfect film to show the range of special screenings on offer,” said an official from Showbox, the film’s distributor.",leebyunghun,3.0,"The article mentions Lee Byung-hun as one of the main stars in ""Emergency Declaration,"" a Korean blockbuster film scheduled for August release that will be shown in multiple immersive cinema formats (Imax, 4DX, Screen X, and 4DX Screen).

Song became the first Korean male actor to win an acting prize at the 75th Cannes Film Festival this year for his role in “Broker,” directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda. In 2007, Jeon won the award for best actress at Cannes for her performance in “Secret Sunshine,” directed by Lee Chang-dong. Song was a co-star in the film. “It has been over two years since we finished filming. We had to delay the release twice due to COVID-19. I am glad that we can finally present our film,” Song said during a press conference held at the Westin Josun Seoul on Monday. The new film centers on the struggle to land a plane after a detective (Song) is tipped off that a suspected terrorist has boarded the plane. Jeon plays the transport minister in charge of the emergency situation. During the press conference, the director talked about when he first received the proposal to create a movie about a plane disaster around 10 years ago. “At the time, I liked the setting and the idea of the film, but was not sure how I could create a plot based on it,” Han said. “Over the last 10 years, we have seen many disasters take place in Korea and watching them, I realized the message that I wanted to deliver through this film.” Han added that the film is not based on any single disaster in particular. The cast of the film highlighted that the film’s thought-provoking message was the main reason for their participation. “The film is about an aviation disaster but it does not focus only on the visual aspects. I liked that it is a thought-provoking film,” said big-name star Lee Byung-hun, who appears as one of the passengers aboard the plane. “I liked the script and also the vision that the director had. It is a movie that can be comforting to people who have been hurt by disasters small and big,” Jeon said. The director put in extra effort to create a realistic-looking set. “We brought over an airplane frame from Hollywood and our art team decorated it to make it look realistic and also look like a Korean airplane,” Han said. To portray the airplane’s movement, he worked with a local special effects company with a giant gimbal to move the airplane around instead of relying on only cameras to create the effect. “Flight attendants got on our airplane and said that it felt like they were on an actual airplane,” Han said.  This film had its world premiere at last year’s Cannes Film Festival. The director said since the film was invited to a noncompetition section at last year’s Cannes, he attended the film festival without much pressure. “Once I got there, I could feel the audiences’ respect for the movie and was very happy to be there,” Han said. “I hope I can take part in the festival again if possible.”　 “Emergency Declaration” will hit local theaters in August.",leebyunghun,3.0,"Lee Byung-hun is mentioned directly in the article, but only briefly as one of the cast members playing a passenger on the plane.

Many renowned actors, including Song Kang-ho, Lee Byung-hun, Jeon Do-yeon and Im Si-wan performed in Han’s new film. Since “Parasite” star Song Kang-ho was also named a jury member, the actor left for France on Saturday to attend the prestigious film festival.

No winners were announced in 2020. This year’s festival, which was originally scheduled to take place in May, had been pushed back to July due to the pandemic. Meanwhile, the organizer will host a film market from Tuesday to July 17 in five different cities outside of Europe -- Seoul, Beijing, Melbourne, Mexico City and Tokyo. Established in 1959, the film market is held annually in conjunction with the Cannes Film Festival. The business counterpart of the film festival allows movie industry professionals including festival organizers and sales agents who registered in advance to watch invited films. It is also an opportunity for the professionals to connect with filmmakers. “Parasite,” which won the Palme d’Or in 2019, was sold to 192 countries at the film market that year. Around 30 movies which were selected for the Cannes Film Festival will be screened in the five cities. Among them, 19 are set to be screened at the film market held in Seoul.

The 13 movie submissions included “Peninsula” by Yeon Sang-ho, “Deliver Us from Evil” by Hong Won-chan and “Beasts that Cling to the Straw” by Kim Yong-hoon, among others. “We had a lot of discussion as to which movie made this year has the most representativeness,” said KOFIC on its announcement Wednesday. “After much discussion, we decided ‘The Man Standing Next’ and ‘Moving On’ had lots of merit and finally chose ‘The Man Standing Next.’ The movie is attractive in that it shows the relatively dark side of history of Korea, which achieved unparalleled economic growth and is now one of the leaders in the culture sector.” “The Man Standing Next” is a spy movie about the 40 days leading up to the assassination of a Korean president. Based on the two years leading up to the assassination of President Park Chung-hee in Oct. 26, 1979 by the head of Korean Central Intelligence Agency Kim Jae-gyu, the movie recreates the intense political maneuvering and fighting around the president. Lee Byung-hun, known internationally for his role in “G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,” plays the role of Kim Kyu-pyung, the Head of KCIA who eventually kills the president, identified only as “President Park.” Veteran actor Lee Sung-min plays the role of the Korean president and Kwak Do-won appears as a former Head of KCIA. After Bong Joon-ho’s “Parasite” won for best international feature as well as best picture, best director and best original screenplay at this year’s Oscars, interest in Korean films has skyrocketed, according to KOFIC. “We hope that more Korean movies reach the international audience and hope ‘The Man Standing Next’ achieves good results,” said KOFIC.

The Korean Film Council (KOFIC) said Thursday that it has chosen ""The Man Standing Next"" out of 13 films as the country's entry for the best international feature film category of the 93rd Academy Awards. The selection came after South Korean director Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite"" swept four awards, including best picture and best international feature film, at this year's Oscars. Directed by Woo Min-ho, ""The Man Standing Next"" chronicles the 40 days of a secretive power struggle among the aides before Park was shot to death at a safe house in Seoul by his chief intelligence officer Kim Jae-kyu, whose motive for the killing is still debated. Park is one of the most controversial figures in modern South Korean history, being the head of a military dictatorship while at the vanguard of the miraculous development of the country's economy at the same time.

Nominated in 11 categories, the film’s big win was not unexpected, but director Bong was noticeably absent. Kwak Sin-ae, head of the film’s production company Barunson E&A, read the acceptance speech on behalf of the director, adding that Bong was on a long leave following a series of international events. “Parasite” also won for best screenplay and music, while the film’s Lee Jung-eun won for supporting actress. A Barunseon E&A official told The Korea Herald that Bong has not been involved in an official event since attending the Oscars in February, focusing on preparing future films. Jung Yu-mi of “Kim Ji-young, Born 1982” and Jin Sun-kyu of “Extreme Job,” who won for best actress and best supporting actor, respectively, also did not attend the ceremony, as they were filming. None of the other nominees for best actress -- Kim Hyang-gi, Kim Hee-ae, Jeon Do-yeon and Han Ji-min -- attended the event. For best actor, all the nominees apart from winner Lee Byung-hun of “Ashfall” were also absent. Once the country’s top film awards, the Daejong Arts Awards has seen its prestige nose-dive in recent years. In 2015, the event was boycotted by several actors and directors for requiring attendance of nominees as a prerequisite for winning. Since then the award has lost some of its luster, with continuing criticism of poor organization and unfair selection of winners, topped by events that further dented its reputation. Many in the industry urged still more efforts by the awards’ organizers to bring back stars to the red carpet. “Above all, the disappointing result shows how disconnected the event’s organizers are from the cineasts in the field,” film critic Kim Sung-soo said. “Right now, the film industry is going through its worst period due to the COVID-19. Most film fests slated for the first half of the year have been postponed, new releases have been canceled and everyone in the industry is going through a difficult time. Pushing ahead with the ceremony at such a time shows that the organizers did not share such concerns of the filmmakers and actors,” the critic added. Filmmaker Lee Sang-woo pointed out that narrowing the gap between the older and younger generations is crucial. “Daejong is an old event and it needs to bring in more young voices from active filmmakers. Although star directors like Bong Joon-ho and Yoon Je-kyun may be too busy to actually take part in its running, the awards need to get such people involved to communicate with young actors and producers. If this communication works, turning the awards back into a festival for everyone won’t be such big deal,” Lee said. Some called for a more fundamental change. “To regain its original reputation, it can’t stop with just selecting winners that are acceptable, but it needs to be able to persuade the actors, directors and producers of the awards’ unique identity,” critic Kim said.

Filming of blockbuster aviation disaster flick “Emergency Declaration,” originally scheduled to start last month, has been postponed, according to the film’s distributor and investor Showbox. “As the film is set inside a plane, it’s a big project in itself and requires more preparations compared to other films. With the coronavirus outbreak continuing, we have decided to take things more slowly,” a Showbox official told The Korea Herald on Wednesday, adding it is undecided when the shooting would start. Helmed by director Han Je-rim of “The King” (2017) and “The Face Reader” (2013) and featuring a star-studded cast of Song Kang-ho, Lee Byung-hun, Jeon Do-yon and Kim Nam-gil, the film was a highly anticipated action-disaster flick. Films with overseas sets have been hit hard by the COVID-19 spread, as travel has become restricted. Last week, the crew and cast of “Bogota,” including lead actor Song Joong-ki, returned from Colombia as filming was suspended. The crime flick about a Korean man who moves to the South American country was expected to be shot mostly in Colombia. “The entire ‘Bogota’ team is returning as of now. Their safety is of the utmost priority and we will decide on how to proceed with the shootings while monitoring the situation,” the film’s distributor Megabox Plus M said last week. “Kidnapped,” starring Ha Jung-woo and Ju Ji-hoon, also put an early hold on the film's production in Morocco. Filming was scheduled to have started in March, but no new schedule has been decided on for now, the film’s distributor Showbox said. Producers of the blockbuster “Negotiations,” featuring Hyun Bin and Hwang Jung-min, have tentatively called off filming in Jordan, proceeding with scenes in Korea first. Yet even films being shot in Korea are finding it difficult to continue. A studio complex operated by the Korea Creative Content Agency in Daejeon -- Studio Cube -- reports seeing cancellations since the outbreak of the virus early this year. “The six studios in the complex were reserved for nearly 1,600 days (total between them) last year, but we’re expecting less than 1,000 days for this year. Even that might be difficult,” an official from Studio Cube told The Korea Herald. “Although we’re supported by the government, regarding the operations of the studios, the impact (from COVID-19) is huge even for us, and probably even worse for private studios,” the official said. According to the official, two of the four big productions that had planned to use the studio this year had canceled reservations. As the public is told to stay away from mass gatherings, locations often used for film shoots -- schools, hospitals and government properties -- are increasingly refusing to allow filming on site as it typically involves around 100 people gathering. Meanwhile, Korean cinemas are seeing the lowest audience numbers in decades. According to Korea Film Council data, around 1.83 million people visited the cinema last month. This is the lowest figure in KOFIC’s data since 2004, and nearly one-eighth of the number of people who went to the movies in the same period last year.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2182535,[Herald Review] Korea finally has quality disaster film in ‘Ashfall’,2019-12-19,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2019/12/18/20191218000771_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"South Korean cinema has always been strong on drama, but it has never really managed to produce a decent big-budget disaster film. “Exit” earlier this year was a pleasant surprise, but it was more of an action-comedy hybrid than a disaster film. “Ashfall” is not a masterpiece by any standard, but directors Lee Hae-jun and Kim Byeong-seo managed to create a decent disaster film that is up to standard in every way, from good acting and character-building to a solid storyline and suspense. The story takes off when Paektusan, the highest mountain on the Korean Peninsula and a dormant volcano, comes out of its slumber and undergoes the biggest eruption in recorded history. But the authorities soon learn that the worst is yet to come: Geologist Gang Bong-rae (Ma Dong-seok/Don Lee) warns that three more eruptions are due, with the last one certain to incinerate both Koreas. With North Korea in ruins, South Korean officials send an explosive ordinance disposal operative, Capt. Jo In-chang (Ha Jung-woo), on a covert mission to steal a nuclear warhead from the North to cause an explosion that might neutralize the effects of Paektusan’s devastating final blow. Jo’s team gets help from North Korean spy Lee Jun-pyeong (Lee Byung-hun), but Lee proves to be a liability. This is the first time I watched a Korean disaster film and felt like it was comparable to one out of Hollywood. Of course, there are innate limitations -- the 26 billion won ($22.2 million) budget is gigantic for a Korean film but ho-hum for Hollywood -- but this is the first film that genuinely seemed big. I’m not just talking about the scale of the disaster. The first volcanic eruption and the ensuing earthquake gobbling up cars, buildings and roads in Seoul were very reminiscent of the 2009 film “2012,” all the way up to the impossible car chase through the crumbling city. In fact, it felt like the directors took a leaf out of Roland Emmerich’s book several times, as seen in the pacing of the film, the suspense-building, the emphasis on family and other aspects. This is not to say the film felt like a cheap knock-off. In fact, this is among the few Korean disaster movies that didn’t feel like one. I absolutely hated the film “Haeundae,” which despite being one of the biggest hits in Korean box office history was not a well-made film. One of its biggest flaws was the heavy dosage of “sinpa” -- referring to overdramatization and emotionalism in a movie or drama -- which ruined the final act. “Ashfall” is everything the 2009 film was supposed to be, depicting a disaster that brings out the personal qualities of the people struggling to stay alive. The characters were for the most part generic. But the actors’ brilliant performance brought them to life. The leading pair absolutely shined with their quirky chemistry. Lee’s character as the unpredictable assassin you had to watch out for was easily the most memorable and enjoyable. He had the skills and the intelligence, and he was ruthless but with a hint of unexpected wit. Ha did just as good a job in bringing something unique to a role that was was written as just another rubber-stamp good guy. He could very well have been the most boring character in the film, but Ha’s facial expressions and delivery made each scene feel genuine. Honestly, no one else on the special force team leaves much of an impression. But the two leads’ offbeat chemistry was something that turned what could very well have been a sappy bromance into a legitimate bond between two men who understand each other. Ma’s role was small, but he brought his trademark charm to the part of a lovable nerd, and Jeon Hye-jin as the presidential aide was solid, if not exactly a standout. Bae Su-sy’s performance as Capt. Jo’s wife was shaky, as the young actress showed she is not yet able to carry roles that demand depth. But the film was clever enough to hide its weak spots by not really focusing on them. That was what I liked about this film. In any other Korean disaster film, the relationship between Jo and his wife would have been the main storyline. While it does account for a chunk of the runtime, it does not distract us from the center of attention: the disaster. No convoluted misunderstanding, out-of-nowhere conflict, cheesy lines or painfully idiotic comic relief. The storytelling is pretty straightforward and obvious. It is a standard disaster film that was pretty fun to watch, but in a country where even that is very scarce, I’d say the directors did a good job. “Ashfall” opens in local theaters Dec. 19.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2179070,‘The Man Standing Next’ a film about final weeks leading to dictator’s death,2019-12-12,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2019/12/12/20191212000474_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Former President Park Chung-hee, a man who ruled over South Korea with an iron fist for 18 years, is a highly divisive figure in the country’s history. So is his right-hand man and eventual assassin, Kim Jae-gyu. The upcoming film “The Man Standing Next,” starring Lee Byung-hun and directed by Woo Min-ho, offers what its creators say is a faithful depiction of the 40 days leading up to the president’s death. “I was pumped up after reading the script and felt that it was a well-polished film noir, even though it is based on a true story,” said Lee during a press conference about the film in Seoul. Lee plays Kim Gyu-pyeong, the fictional lead character based on Kim Jae-gyu. Based on a nonfiction book of the same name, the original Korean title literally translates into “Directors of Namsan,” referring to the directors of the now-defunct Korean Central Intelligence Agency.  The spy agency, founded after Park came to power, answered directly to the president and has been accused of numerous politically charged crimes, including kidnap and torture, mostly in the Namsan area. Former President Kim Dae-jung, one of Park’s biggest political rivals, was perhaps the best-known victim of the agency. Veteran actor Lee Sung-min plays the character inspired by Park Chung-hee, called only “President Park.” Despite the different names, the film is about the true story of Kim Jae-gyu -- the chief of the spy agency at the time of the assassination -- and his predecessor Kim Hyong-uk, who in this picture is named Park Yong-gak. It is Park Yong-gak who sets the events in motion by traveling to the US after losing power and testifying before the US Congress, dishing up dirt on the administration. “When I read the book 20 years ago, it was so shocking that I read it in one sitting. Eighteen years of modern Korean history that I didn’t really know about unraveled before me, and I vowed to one day make a movie about it,” said director Woo. He said the timing of Park’s revelations to the US politicians was the only major change made in the cinematic adaptation -- the actual event took place two years before the assassination, not 40 days. “The content of the original was so vast, so I decided to depict the 40 crucial days. Why the incident (the assassination) happened is what interested me the most,” he said. Playing opposite Lee is Kwak as Park Yong-gak, the president’s onetime confidant, who turns on him after being ousted from the administration. “Usually when acting, it is possible to anticipate the other (actor’s) movement. With Kwak, that was impossible. It was as if he were completely throwing himself into the situation,” Lee said of his co-star. Another person who went all in was Lee Hee-jun, playing the head of the president’s security team, a character inspired by Park’s loyal bodyguard Cha Ji-chul. The usually slender actor put on 25 kilograms to depict the famously heavy Cha. Kwak and the rest of the cast said they made efforts to be faithful to what actually happened, so as to not distort history. “I kept thinking that there is not enough material (on real-life people). I kept pondering (over the character) as to how I should depict him, up until the very last shooting,” said Kwak. “We had to act in a way that was close to reality,” Lee said. “I think playing a real person based on a real-life event can help the audience connect more with the film. In that sense, I think it will be a very powerful film.” “The Man Standing Next” opens in local theaters in January.

The producers of “The Man Standing Next” confirmed Tuesday that the film -- inspired by the true story of the assassination of a former Korean president -- will open next month. Starring Lee Byung-hun, Lee Sung-min and Kwak Do-won, the film is based on real-life events that took place in the 40 days leading up to the assassination of former President Park Chung-hee.  Showbox, the film’s distributor, released photos of both Lees as their respective characters in their office, another photo of a man standing in front of a tank, and one of Kwak speaking in what appears to be a courtroom -- possibly at the trial of the character inspired by Kim Jae-gyu, Park’s confidant-turned-assassin. Lee Byung-hun plays this controversial figure, who remains the subject of conflicting theories, and Lee Sung-min plays the man who reigned over the country for 18 years. The film is directed by Woo Min-ho, the mind behind the acclaimed criminal drama “Inside Men.” Another Lee Byung-hun film will be screened in theaters later this month. “Ashfall,” starring Lee and Ha Jung-woo, will hit the theaters Dec. 19, according to CJ ENM. The film, also starring Ma Dong-suk (Don Lee), Jeon Hye-jin and Bae Su-zy -- better known as K-pop star Suzy -- is about what happens when multiple volcanic eruptions occur at Paektusan and a group of people from North and South Korea must join forces to stop the annihilation of the Korean Peninsula. Lee plays an operative from the North, Ha plays an explosive ordinance disposal operative from the South, and Ma plays a geologist. All three characters play a critical role in a plan to stop the final explosion that will wipe out everyone on both sides.　 It is directed by Lee Hae-jun, the veteran screenwriter and director at the helm of the 2009 film “Castaway on the Moon.” Another major player, Lotte Entertainment, is expected to announce a release date soon for “Forbidden Dreams,” starring Choi Min-sik and Han Suk-kyu. The film is set to hit the theaters in December, and the specific date is widely expected to fall in the last week of the month. The film is set in the Joseon era and tells the story of King Sejong (Han) and scientist and engineer Jang Yeong-sil (Choi). It focuses on the relationship between the two men of science and on what may have happened after Jang’s name vanished from the records, following his downfall due to a famous blunder that caused injury to the king.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1758418,[Herald Review] ‘Mr. Sunshine’ offers ray of hope with mesmerizing fantasy,2018-08-21,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2018/08/21/20180821000577_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Historical fiction with charming characters and flair captivate viewers People say there is no point asking the “what if” question in history. But maybe, there is, if the intention is to help heal wounds of the present and instill hope for the future through creative work. “Mr. Sunshine,” a 24-episode TV drama series aired by cable channel tvN is a historical fiction that starts with the question “what if there were a ranking Korean-American at the US Legation in the Joseon period before Japan annexed Korea in 1910?” Lee Byung-hun, one of the best known Korean actors in Hollywood, plays the Korean-American Marine Corps officer Eugene Choi, who falls in love with a noble woman and secret member of “righteous army” militias that sought to thwart looming Japanese invasion in the beginning of the 20th century. According to an article published by the Center for the Study of Intelligence under the US Central Intelligence Agency, US Minister Lucius Foote at the US Legation in Seoul requested a contingent of US Marines to guard and protect the legation property after witnessing a three-day failed coup d’etat in 1884 to unseat the royal family, followed by days of riots and mob violence in the city. But the US never actually sent their Marines to Joseon. Eugene Choi appears to be the product of wishful imagination inspired by US naval attache George Foulke, who spoke Korean, explored various parts of the country, and even understood the political intrigues between factions in Joseon’s court that were influenced by China and Japan at the time. The producers of “Mr. Sunshine” also took note of the US expedition to Korea in 1871 that led to an armed conflict known as Shinmiyangyo, which roughly translates into “Western disturbance in the Shinmi year.” It was the first American military action in Korea and left five Korean forts destroyed and more than 350 Koreans dead on and around Ganghwa Island. The first two episodes of the series are emotionally difficult to watch as they portray the brutality of some in the ruling yangban class, and how Joseon was a cruel place for those in the lowest ranks of the social hierarchy. Choi was the son of a nobi, a serf who was considered property. He ran away after his father was beaten to death at the orders of the yangban who owned them, and his mother killed herself. Thanks to several people, including two nobi chasers -- an actual profession in the Joseon era -- who turned a blind eye to the 9-year-old boy, Choi was able to escape to the US. But the show’s key message is not about Joseon-era social hierarchy. Although history unfolded a dismal path for Joseon, “Mr. Sunshine,” as its title hints, is about how ordinary Koreans can help build a better society. It is a fantasy created to inspire viewers living today’s deep-rooted political and socioeconomic divisions. As the show moves on to the following episodes, typical Korean-style, but original whiffs of humor disarm viewers. Touching stories of the characters, beautiful scenes and music quickly mesmerize viewers. All the recurring characters in “Mr. Sunshine,” save a few Japanese, Americans and a Russian, represent the people living the past and present of Korea. A boy who lost his hunter father during Shinmiyangyo, for example, grows into a member of the underground militia who trains yangban woman Ko Ae-shin as a sniper. Ko, played by actress Kim Tae-ri, was a newborn when her “euibyeong (righteous army)” parents were killed by pro-Japan collaborator Lee Wan-ik. Lee is a fictional recreation of a real person in history -- Ye Wan-yong, a pro-Japanese minister of Korea who signed the Japan Korea Annexation Treaty which placed Korea under Japanese rule in 1910. Like the 2016 tvN hit drama “Reply 1988,” “Mr. Sunshine” accentuates the different dialects spoken by the amiable recurring cast as part of efforts to underscore social harmony in a country where its two largest political parties fed on regional animosities. Despite criticism that the drama series can be historically misleading as it is way too imaginative, the fantasy of “Mr. Sunshine” deeply resonates with viewers thanks to its K-drama forte in attractive cast, synopsis full of life and artistic flair. “Mr. Sunshine” airs Saturdays and Sundays on tvN. The 14th episode was broadcast last Sunday, marking a high viewer rate of 15.6 percent.

The famed duo have proven their teamwork through hit series “Descendants of the Sun” and “Guardian: The Lonely and Great God.” The story is set in Korea in the early 1900s, as it is on the verge of being colonized by Japan. “Not much drama or film has been made about the early 1900s. Not much history has been told, too,” director Lee said at a press event held Tuesday at Patio 9 in southern Seoul. Veteran actor Lee Byung-hun and rookie actress Kim Tae-ri are the main leads. Lee is to play Eugene Choi, who travels to the United States in the 1870s and returns as a US soldier. It’s Lee’s first time to feature in a drama series in nine years. “My character is very unique. He is an American soldier who is also a Korean. But he is not very patriotic about Korea, rather, he wants to have his revenge on the nation,” he said. Kim Eun-sook’s dramas are often appreciated for romantic, catchy lines. Gong Yoo, Song Joong-ki, Lee Jong-suk and Lee Min-ho rose as “national heartthrobs” after starring in her dramas as male leads. “She is a beloved scriptwriter. I am learning that there is this ‘Kim Eun-sook language.’ It was awkward and unusual at first for me. But now I fully understand the script, and the meaning behind it,” Lee said. Kim Tae-ri plays Ko Ae-shin, the daughter of a rich and noble family. But at night, she turns into a rebel, assassinating those who betray the country for Japan. The drama marks Kim Tae-ri’s first small-screen production. “I didn’t even read the scenario when making the decision to feature in the work,” Kim said. “My character is very ironic. She is defiant, rebellious but also the daughter of a high-class family. She goes through inner conflicts, deciding what to take and what to discard.” Kim revealed that she isn’t overwhelmed by the 20-year age gap between her and Lee. Rather, she considers herself lucky. “Luckily, I have had experience working with veteran actors. I am overwhelmed that I might not be able follow to Lee in acting, but not by age. I am so lucky, it is a great opportunity to learn,” she said. Apart from the lead couple, the cast includes big names such as Yoo Yeon-seok, Kim Min-jung and Byun Yo-han. The Saturday-Sunday drama series is to air through Netflix, a global streaming service. It holds great anticipation as the scriptwriter and the producer’s previous works were greatly loved in and out of Korea -- making them very profitable as well. “Though I have starred in Hollywood films, it is my first time to be in a Korean production that will be showcased around the world at some time. It’s a thrilling event,” Lee said. “I think every drama or film is about humans in the end. It is about human relationships,” he said. “Though the series is based on the Korean history, foreign viewers will be able to understand the feelings and emotions through characters and their relationships.” The 24-part series will air its first episode on July 7 at 9 p.m. By Im Eun-byel ()",leebyunghun,5.0,"The article is highly relevant to Lee Byung-hun as he is one of the main protagonists of ""Mr. Sunshine.""

It claimed that the writer has been focusing on writing the script for “Mr. Sunshine,” a highly anticipated tvN drama, after overcoming the pain.

Whether he is slinging guns in “The Magnificent Seven” or breathing down the neck of Kyle Reese in “Terminator Genisys,” Lee’s character traits in films have mostly been like his image: a man you do not want to mess with. This aura is shattered immediately in “Keys to the Heart” -- co-starring Youn Yuh-jung and Park Jung-min -- where Lee plays a washed-up former boxer who gets by day to day.  Director Choi Sung-hyun takes Lee and Youn, two of the heaviest hitters in Korean cinema, and creates a comedy flick that viewers can enjoy without a care in the world. The plot revolves around two brothers who are estranged from their mother, In-suk, who ran away from her abusive husband nearly three decades ago. Jo-hwa --- played by Lee -- is the older brother who holds a grudge against his mother for leaving him with his violent father, and Jin-tae -- Park’s character -- the musical savant younger brother. Right off the bat, the movie sounds like a cheap knock-off of Oscar-winning 1988 classic “Rain Man.” But the film does have its own merits. The transformation of Jo-hwa -- initially painted as a jerk -- is painfully obvious and predictable. He is the pinnacle of the “loveable loser”; misunderstood, abandoned by mom, has a violent side, but also good-hearted. Of course, his conflict with his mother can be reconciled, her sins can be forgiven and anyone watching their first five minutes together can guess that they will end up loving each other again. Jin-tae is the loveable doofus in the picture. He behaves like a child, but has a brilliant side to him. He is annoying to no end, but you cannot help but root for him. The characters are generic, the plot is predictable and there are virtually no surprises coming around the corner. The film’s charm comes from the acting. Lee‘s brilliance is that he shines even when portraying a rubber-stamp character. “Laughter and tears is one of the most obvious ‘formulas’ that has continued from the birth of the very first movie. Our film follows the formula, but I think people still seek out these movies because the depth and details (of the film) stands out,” Lee said at the premiere of the movie, held Wednesday in Seoul. Youn, who jokingly said Lee never felt like her son because of his sheer presence, commended the chemistry of Lee and Park and said she was disappointed with her own performance. Her brilliance as an elderly prostitute in last year’s award-winning “The Bacchus Lady” is missing, but her presence plays a critical role in holding the plot together. The directing, while passable, does not stand out. The story is very much one-dimensional and virtually all of the characters -- with the exception of Jo-hwa -- are static throughout the film. The landlady and her daughter, even the former piano prodigy who supports the brothers, are all mere plot devices. This is particularly disappointing as the latter is played by Han Ji-min, one of the biggest names in the credits. To ensure that all the heroes are likeable, the movie inserts an almost comic book-like villain, Jo-hwa’s father, to stand on the other side of the spectrum. His sinister looks, voice, exaggerated expression and utterly unremorseful attitude show he exists for the sole purpose of evil. The character fails to add any depth to the story, in stark contrast to the abusive father in Yang Ik-jun’s brilliant 2008 film “Breathless,” who was there to provoke thoughts on inherited violence. While Park Jung-min shows his talent in playing the musical savant, he is grossly underused in that Jin-tae is merely a subject of the other characters’ conflict. The chemistry between the brothers -- who are featured heavily in the promotion -- is smaller than that between the mother and son. This is partly why it feels much different from “Rain Man”; it is essentially a mother-son story, not one of brotherly love. The flick is by no means a masterpiece, and is hardly comedy gold. But it does deserve a place in the hearts of people who seek that warm, fuzzy feeling from a family picture, standing on some good acting. The film hits local theaters on Jan. 17.

Genres continue to be limited to political thrillers and crime flicks, and the scarcity of female roles persists. Despite the relative lack of diversity, however, 2017 turned out to be a year that offered several pleasant, unexpected surprises for moviegoers. Quieter, more pensive films excelled this year, offering insight into humanity and the everyday.  Okja  Adventure, fantasy   Directed by Bong Joon-ho   Distributed by Netflix, Next Entertainment World “Okja” is a film full of heart, an optimistic story that also peers into some of the most twisted aspects of a social order mankind has created for themselves. 　 Vegetarians and environmentalists hailed the film as an effective campaign tool against the mass-production of meat, and though it makes an excellent case, the film is much more than an advocate for green eating. It speaks of universal issues such as the need for empathy, the inevitable pang of growing up and facing a vicious world, the inhumane order of capitalism and the terrible consequences that one person’s envy can cause. 　 At once a coming-of-age tale, satire and good old-fashioned adventure ride, led by the indefatigable young heroine Mija (Ahn Seo-hyun), “Okja” once again proves director Bong’s unique sensitivity and intellect. It includes picturesque Korean landscapes, large-scale yet detailed chase scenes, a richly layered story and an equally diverse cast.  The Fortress  Historical drama  Directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk   Distributed by CJ Entertainment    In Korea, dozens of period pieces are made every year for both film and television, but “The Fortress” is that rare example of a historical drama that appreciates history in all its complexity. 　 It also invites viewers to ponder philosophical issues through characters who seem to adhere to a higher moral standard than the modern bureaucrat. The year is 1636. The location, Namhansanseong, a mountain fortress southeast of Seoul. Joseon’s King Injo (Park Hae-il), his advisers and people are trapped within its walls in the freezing winter, unable to escape from or fight against a Chinese invasion. 　 At the center of the film lies the ideological struggle that ensues as the king’s two highest advisors -- Choi Myung-gil (Lee Byung-hun) and Kim Sang-hun (Kim Yoon-seok) -- fiercely debate on the course of action to take. Choi opts to surrender, arguing that life and survival precede lofty ideals, while Kim, staunchly believing that the only meaningful life is one with honor and dignity, argues Joseon should fight even if it means death. 　 The film’s debate mirrors the philosophical tension that was pervasive throughout the Joseon era; some scholars today argue that it was Joseon’s excessive emphasis on form and formality that led to its demise. In the film, both arguments, meanwhile, pale when compared to the brutal reality of people dying from frostbite and starvation.  The Running Actress  Drama, comedy  Directed by Moon So-ri   Distributed by Metaplay Humorous, intelligent and reflective, this is a gem of a film and the directorial feature debut of acclaimed actress Moon So-ri, known for films such as “Oasis.” Moon, who penned, directed and starred in the film, tells a semi-autobiographical three-part story about the daily life of an actress, which usually begins and ends in a breakdown in her van. 　 Moon struggles with the gap between the cachet people place on actresses -- “You must not eat (cheap) food like this!” -- and the painfully menial, often demeaning, details of her actual daily routine. With a livelihood that relies so heavily on “personal charm” and “beauty,” the actress perennially wavers between confidence in her skills, the courage to ask for better roles and intense insecurity. The film ends with a stirring contemplation on art and life.  The First Lap  Drama  Directed by Kim Dae-hwan   Distributed by Indieplug    With his sophomore feature, Kim Dae-hwan proves once again that he has a keen eye for capturing the real Korean family. His debut work “End of Winter” observed how deep-seated resentments begin manifesting themselves after a family is snowed in in their hometown. 　 “The First Lap” focuses on a young couple as they attempt to navigate adult life, meet each other’s families and evade, for as long as possible, that daunting institution of marriage for fear of turning out like their respective parents. In two achingly naturalistic performances that were in large part adlibbed, according to director Kim, Jo Hyun-chul and Kim Sae-byuk bring to life a thoroughly average millennial Korean couple and all their blunders.  The Merciless  Crime, action  Directed by Byun Sung-hyun  Distributed by CJ Entertainment Director Byun made an explosive debut with the stylish noir “The Merciless,” which was invited to Cannes Film Festival’s midnight screenings in May. 　 The value of this film lies in its style -- its bold, vintage colors, the meticulous arrangement of the buildings and people -- and how it follows the emotions of its two lead characters, the seemingly hardened gangster Han Jae-ho (Sol Kyung-gu) and reckless young delinquent Jo Hyun-soo (Im Si-wan). Their relationship evolves to become deeper than a bromance and more calculated than a romance. The film’s box office numbers, meanwhile, received a blow due to public outrage at director Byun’s sexual tweets about his actors, for which the director subsequently apologized. Distinctly ‘Korean’ films that soothed the souls of Koreans  “A Taxi Driver,” directed by Jang Hoon, became the 11th most-viewed Korean film of all time. Through the movie, we see that through the efforts of one taxi driver -- played by the always enjoyable Song Kang-ho -- and a relentless German journalist, Korea’s May 18 Democratic Uprising, where hundreds were killed while protesting the military government, became known to the world. “I Can Speak,” directed by Kim Hyeon-suk, also deals with Korea’s lingering pain from history. The elderly Na Ok-boon (Na Moon-hee) is a neighborhood busybody who pesters civil servant Park Min-jae (Lee Je-hoon) for English lessons. It turns out that Na was forced into military sexual slavery in her youth by the Japanese. By learning English, she exposes Japan’s crimes on the international stage. Spectacular computer graphics   Ryoo Seung-wan’s “The Battleship Island” recreated almost in its entirety Japan’s Hashima Island, where Korean people were forced into slave labor by the Japanese, both using a set and through computer graphics. The film shows large-scale explosions in the narrow underground coal mines, Korean laborers’ decrepit living conditions and a rebellion that breaks out among the workers. 　 Kim Yong-hwa’s “Along with the Gods: The Two Worlds” offered another example of sheer scale and spectacle. It created a vast fantasy world of the afterlife, from the burning hell of lava to sprawling deserts and towering waterfalls. The graphics were undertaken by Kim’s Dexter Studios, one of Asia’s leading motion picture production studios. Daring films that attempted to transcend genre   Director Lee Sa-rang’s “Real,” starring Kim Soo-hyun, caused a small sensation when it was released in June. With blaring electronic visuals (so much red lighting), a plot that attempted to intertwine the present, the past, the psyche, and reality, and explicit sex scenes, the film was incomprehensible and utterly new -- though perhaps not in the best way. It is worth noting for its courage to break all rules. Shin Su-won’s “Glass Garden” features a scientist (Moon Geun-young) who isolates herself in the forest to research blood. She discovers a way to create “green blood” by infusing blood with chloroplasts, and dreams of one day turning into a tree. The novelty of the premise led the film to open this year’s Busan International Film Festival.

In the winter of 1636, King Injo of Joseon Dynasty sought refuge inside the bulwark fleeing an invasion by the Qing Dynasty. ""The Fortress,"" a new film released Tuesday, illuminates the embattled king's 47 days of hiding which ended in a humiliating surrender to a conquering Chinese general. Directed by Hwang Dong-hyuck and adapted from a best-selling novel, the movie is not simply about the tragic defeat, but a tale of patriotic assertion, persuasion and making impossible decisions in the face of a looming existential threat. The film boasts an ensemble cast of strong character actors who add to the serious and tense tone throughout the period flick. Park Hae-il of ""Memories of Murder"" and ""Host"" effectively portrays the conflicted, troubled young king faced with a choice between disgraceful submission or the total annihilation of his people. But the true stars are the characters of his top aides, Choi Myung-kil and Kim Sang-heon, played by Lee Byung-hun and Kim Yoon-seok, respectively. Throughout the film's 11 chapters, Choi, the top personnel affairs official, and Kim, foreign policy chief, engage in a series of spirited debate on war and diplomacy. Choi presses the king to cede for survival, while Kim argues for resistance even at the cost of national destruction. Though on opposite ends, both men are depicted as genuine patriots as they stand firm on what they believe is in the best interest of their king and nation. Lee once again proves that he is one of Korea's most versatile actors. Kim exudes an extra level of heft and gravitas required in such a tense film. Though given less screen time, supporting characters played by Go Soo, Park Hee-soon and Jung Myung-soo are never outshined by the main leads. A majority of key scenes take place within a make-shift palace inside the fortress, where Injo and aides discuss survival options and resource distribution -- such as whether to use the last remaining hay to feed the starving war horses or use it to make makeshift blankets for front line soldiers. The confined setting often renders the film in a theatrical atmosphere. Their long, highly oratory dialogue gives a feel of courtroom drama. The film, shot beautifully, is not short of dynamism. Breathtakingly wide vista of the barren winter mountains fills up the screen. Visually exciting battle sequences spread throughout the film as much as they are consequential in terms of moving forward the plot. Accompanied by Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto's nuanced-yet-dramatic score, the movie's visuals also feel as if a sepia-tone filter was layered over it, apparently to highlight the dire mental and physical conditions the people within the fortress are in.",leebyunghun,5.0,"The article directly discusses Lee Byung-hun's performance as one of the main characters (Choi Myung-kil) in ""The Fortress"" and specifically praises his acting, noting that he ""once again proves that he is one of Korea's most versatile actors.""

Within the fortress’ walls, Joseon officials desperately debated the course of action -- whether to surrender or fight despite the enormous gap in military power -- based on diverging philosophies on the meaning of honor, life and death. The king’s chief advisers are actor Lee’s Choi Myung-gil, defending life and survival over lofty ideals, and Kim’s Kim Sang-hun, who staunchly believes that the only meaningful life is one with honor and dignity. Director Hwang has tried his hand at many different genres. His “Miss Granny” (2014) a box office hit, which has spun several pan-Asian remakes, was a comedy. His film “Silenced” (2011) was a drama about school violence and human rights advocacy. Music for “The Fortress” has been undertaken by globally acclaimed Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto, who wrote the music for 2015’s “The Revenant,” a film which also served as a reference for “The Fortress,” director Hwang said. “This film, too, is a story of the cold and punishment,” said Hwang at a press conference for the film at CGV Yongsan in Seoul on Monday. “I was a longtime fan of (Sakamoto), but I had no idea how to contact him or if he would even agree (to work on this film) until I read an interview … and discovered that he was open to different projects. We then got in touch with him and after reading the synopsis, he happily agreed to work on the film.” The film also stars Go Soo as a blacksmith and Park Hae-il as King Injo.

It is the first time the historical event has been rendered on cinema screens. “The tension was palpable on set,” said director Hwang. “All of the actors gave such intense performances.” 　 “It is a film that took pains to portray history accurately. It’s not a film that has fantasy elements,” said Lee. “I took a very serious approach in portraying (the character).” Park said it had been a huge mental burden to portray the king, faced with an impossible choice. The veteran actors met for the first time on this film set, they said. 　 “I don’t know why we hadn’t crossed paths before,” said Kim. “It was such a refreshing and enjoyable experience.”　 Kim described Lee as an actor who “goes by the book.” “There’s a fluidity and glamor to him as well, of course, but in his role, he delivers his lines in a very refined state.” 　 The film will open in theaters in September. 　 By Rumy Doo ()",leebyunghun,5.0,"The article is highly relevant to Lee Byung-hun as he plays one of the main roles (Choi Myung-gil) in ""The Fortress.""

The common factor between the three films is director Hong Sang-soo, with whom she has openly admitted to having a romantic relationship. Strong creative bonds commonly exist between directors and actors, with the latter often serving as screen embodiments of personas envisioned by the former. The Korea Herald has compiled a list of director-actor duos that have gained both local and international fame. Bong Joon-ho, Tilda Swinton and Song Kang-ho The famed director and Scottish actress have on various occasions made public their mutual professional respect and fondness for each other. Swinton’s appearance in Bong’s dystopian drama “Snowpiercer” (2013) was the result of the actress’ initiative, she said. When the two met at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, Swinton had eagerly expressed her wish to star in a Bong production. “We started chatting like children the moment we met,” Swinton said in a 2013 interview. “I told him, let’s make a fun movie and he said he was confident.”　 The actress had wrapped up two lengthy projects at the time -- “Julia” (2008) and “We Need to Talk About Kevin” (2011). But her meeting with Bong had overturned her decision to take a long break, she said. “I was exhausted like a farmer after a hard harvest. But I couldn’t give up on working with Bong. I had been a longtime fan. “I had always wondered how his films could be so unique when watching them. Working with him, I felt he was someone who structured a film perfectly but who also had an intense energy.” Known to tackle eccentric parts, Swinton played the role of Mason, the maniacal rule-keeper of the train that is doomed to a never-ending journey in order to generate heat in the frozen world of “Snowpiercer.” Swinton stars in the Bong’s upcoming film “Okja,” which was on Thursday named for this year’s Cannes’ competition category. In a trailer released by Netflix, Swinton is seen in a platinum blonde bob narrating, “I took science and nature and I synthesized.” Viewers assume Swinton plays a scientist or executive in the company that gives birth to Okja, a gruesome, gentle monster. In Korea, meanwhile, Bong’s persona has long been represented by actor Song Kang-ho, known for his unfettered portrayals of the comic and the everyman -- characters who possess no extraordinary traits, yet preserve an essence of humanity within an inexplicably savage world. Song starred as an unassuming small town detective looking into the country’s first serial killing in Bong’s breakout mystery “Memories of Murder” (2003). In the 2006 sci-fi thriller “The Host,” in which a strange creature overtakes Seoul’s Han River, Song plays the lethargic father Kang-du who finds himself galvanized to action to protect his daughter in the face of disaster. Song plays Namgoong Min-su in “Snowpiercer,” an engineer-turned-drug addict dredging in the lowest-class compartment of the hierarchical train, choosing to escape from reality. He eventually rises as a guide to passengers in their rebellion, a figure who does not yield to authority but rejects the system altogether. Hong Sang-soo, Jung Jae-young and Isabelle Huppert Before director Hong’s much-publicized affair with the actress Kim, he had long been known for inserting his alter ego into his nonchalantly realistic films, represented by actors such as Kim Tae-woo, Yoo Joon-sang and Kim Sang-kyung. But the best embodiment of Hong’s trademark character, the hypocritical artist who is often chauvinistic, vain but hopelessly self-unaware is perhaps actor Jung Jae-young, who starred in “Our Sunhi” (2013), “Right Now, Wrong Then” (2015), “On the Beach at Night Alone” (2017) and “Clair’s Camera” (2017). “I don’t think I acted out a character. I tried my best not to act,” Jung said in a 2015 interview for “Right Now, Wrong Then,” in which he portrays a married film director clumsily making advances at a timid painter, played by Kim Min-hee. French actress Isabelle Huppert has also worked with director Hong multiple times, first in the 2012 comedy-drama “In Another Country,” and most recently in “Clair’s Camera.” In the 2012 film, Huppert plays three different versions of the “charming French visitor” -- a famous filmmaker, the wife of a rich French executive, and a divorced housewife -- as the film traces how her hosts’ behavior and conversations shift subtly according to her different statuses. “Through these three little stories we see a woman’s whole emotional life -- desire, expectation, loneliness, love, disappointment,” Huppert said to The Guardian in a 2012 interview at Cannes. “(Hong) writes his dialogue every night and gives you the script every morning, and you shoot it. The film looks spontaneous but it’s very precise actually.” Kim Jee-woon & Lee Byung-hun  Director Kim Jee-woon rose to acclaim through his highly stylized, elegant depictions of bleak lives. Actor Lee Byung-hun is a central figure in his filmography, the core of the director’s calculated cinematography. The 2005 mobster noir “A Bittersweet Life” still remains one of Kim and Lee’s representative works to this day. Lee plays Seon-woo, a loyal and perfectionist gangster whose life spirals out of control when he is ordered to carry out the dangerous task of spying on his boss’ girlfriend, and acts on an emotional impulse. In Kim’s Korean-style Western adventure “The Good, the Bad, the Weird” (2008), an homage to Sergio Leone’s “The Good, the Bad, the Ugly” (1966) and set against the backdrop of 1930s Manchuria, Lee plays “the bad” gang leader Park Chang-yi. The character is ruthless in his single-minded pursuit of treasure depicted on a mysterious map, the dark counterpart of “the weird” train robber played by Song Kang-ho and “the good” bounty hunter played by Jung Woo-sung. The role brought Lee critical and popular acclaim, imprinting him in viewers’ minds as a villain of all-consuming force. Lee himself called Kim an “intense director” in a 2009 interview. “You can tell from his films. How can you create such scenes … if you are not intense?” E J Yong & Youn Yuh-jung Director E J Yong’s muse and persona seem to be the veteran actress Youn Yuh-jung, who starred in “Actresses” (2009), an experimental documentary-style film tracing behind-the-scenes gossip among female performers. E is known for spotlighting the often irrational emotional battles between his sensitive characters. Youn plays a version of herself, a 60-something actress who feels awkward at a fashion shoot. She teams up with E again in “The Bacchus Lady” (2016) in which Youn portrays an aged sex worker who ends up offering much more than sexual services to her elderly clientele. Youn won best actress for her performance in the film at Montreal’s Fantasia International Film Festival. “It’s not a commercial film. But I was happy I could take on a role that fits my age,” Youn said in an interview last year. While the filming process was “unbelievably hard,” Youn said she took on the project due to her faith in E. “I know him well … and I trusted he would deal with the subject matter in a way that is not sensational or extreme.” By Rumy Doo ()",leebyunghun,4.0,"The article directly discusses Lee Byung-hun's significant collaboration with director Kim Jee-woon, specifically highlighting their work together in ""A Bittersweet Life"" (2005) and ""The Good, the Bad, the Weird"" (2008).

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1247278,[Movie Review] ‘Single Rider’ explores what we have left behind,2017-02-22,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2017/02/22/20170222000627_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"The film invites viewers to contemplate what is really important in life The man appeared to have everything: a well-paying job, a good reputation in his field, a beautiful wife and an adorable son. At precisely this moment, everything starts to crumble. Director Lee Zoo-young’s feature film debut “Single Rider” invites the audience to take a look at a man’s life after he loses practically everything he has worked for. “I wanted the audience to think about what we are giving up now for the promise of a future. ... There are so many things that we give up, and I wanted to tell a story through which we can think about what is truly important,” said Lee.  Actor Lee Byung-hun plays Jae-hoon, a stockbroker who loses his fortune, friends and the trust of his clients after a risky investment goes abysmally wrong. The embattled protagonist leaves for Australia to find his family, only to discover they too are slipping out of his grasp. The rookie movie director shows off her skills through a “show, don’t tell” technique, demonstrated in her track record as a director of advertisements and music videos. What the flick lacks in dialogue, it more than makes up for through the movements and expressions of its actors, with veteran actor Lee leading the way. “This movie follows a man’s thoughts and emotions from the beginning to the end. (My acting) is in the subtle change in emotions and facial expressions, which is something that I’ve always wanted to try as an actor,” said the 46-year-old Lee. Jae-hoon’s wife Su-jin, played by Gong Hyo-jin, is found to have rediscovered her passion for music that she gave up upon her marriage. Along with her deepening relationship with a friendly neighbor, she appears to have started down a path of which Jae-hoon is not a part. He watches helplessly from afar as those dearest to him drift away. As Jae-hoon stalks his family, the camera shadows him every step of the way. “The camera work and the angle was set at Jae-hoon’s eye-level. I wanted the movie to be shot from a man’s point of view,” said director Lee. She added that shooting in Australia was a deliberate choice, to contrast with Seoul, which has the opposite season as it is in a different hemisphere. In the foreign land, Jae-hoon’s midlife crisis takes place with him completely isolated from everyone else. All except Ji-na, a Korean student who develops a friendship with him after being swindled of all she earned working in the country. “When you get on the bus at five in the morning, you realize that people are saying you’re poor because you’re lazy. ... It’s all bullshit,” says penniless Ji-na, played by singer-turned-actress Ahn So-hee. The former idol singer, for the most part, holds her own against the talents of Lee and Gong. Ahn, whose acting career has been shaky so far, says her sharing many similar traits with her character has helped her focus. “It’s a movie that helps me think, ‘What am I missing out on?’” she said. The film is not kind to an audience looking for an immediate payoff, with the main characters acting in a frustrating -- or sometimes downright confusing -- fashion. It builds up toward the third act, where what had seemed a wild goose chase finally starts to make sense. “The inaction by Jae-hoon builds up frustration, which means the big reveal in the climax can be cathartic,” said Gong. Director Lee challenges the audience to think about the true meaning of happiness and what really matters in life. “I hope this film will be a movie that people think about once in a while, even after it’s over. A movie that has a certain warmth to it,” she said.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1177788,"[Herald Review] Cult, money and politics in eerily lifelike ‘Master’",2016-12-13,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2016/12/13/20161213001021_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"After almost two decades of strict censorship under the authoritarian Park Chung-hee regime, Korean cinema began producing heavily political movies following the country’s democratization in the 1980s. While some saw film as a device of pure artistic expression, a large chunk of filmmakers viewed the medium as “the most powerful political and social weapon,” according to “Korean Cinema after Liberation,” a study by Hallym University’s professor Park Seung-hyun.　 Countless films have since satirized government corruption and the collusion of politics and businesses. In recent years, however, filmmakers seem even more intent in doing so. The latest political movie “Master” follows in the steps of last year’s “Veteran” and “Inside Men” and this year’s “Asura: The City of Madness” and “Pandora.” These movies share common themes -- forces of unreasoning, unrepentant corruption that sway the country -- and conclude (save for “Asura”) with an exhilarating delivery of justice. However, “Master,” drawing from Korea’s web of politics, businesses and cult-like groups, feels even more eerily prescient than its predecessors: It is being released just as the country is hurled into the thick of a political maelstrom involving President Park Geun-hye, the daughter of a cult leader and top Korean conglomerates. In the film, Chairman Jin, played by the ever-skilled Lee Byung-hun, is the psychotic head of a financial organization that gathers astronomical investments from lower middle-class clients. At massive investor rallies, which resemble cult gatherings, the silver-tongued Jin riles up audiences with the promise of hefty returns. “We’re a family,” he says, as people cheer fanatically. Jin, of course, has handsomely bribed high level government officials to peddle influence. With a phone call, Jin is able to thwart all systems and institutions. The country is, quite literally, at his fingertips.　 At his tail is investigator Kim Jae-myung (Gang Dong-won), who is driven by an all-consuming thirst to catch the bad guys. Kim himself is an elite policeman who has passed the bar exam and works directly under the police commissioner. Kim finds a way to infiltrate Jin’s empire through Park Jang-gun (Kim Woo-bin), the brain of Jin’s corporation and a genius hacker who manipulates computer systems to generate profits. “Through this case, I’m going to cut off the rotten head (of this country),” vows investigator Kim, as he strikes a deal with Park, caught between two giant powers, to spy on Jin. But the chairman is a master at destroying evidence and getting charges dropped. “Even if he’s caught by the police, the prosecutor will draw out the process, and he’ll be released in court,” a fellow investigator says. 　 When the heat turns up, Jin stows away to China and fakes his own death. Investigator Kim is demoted for exerting unduly aggressive force in his investigations. Meanwhile, Jin has comfortably settled in the Philippines, devising a new plan to launder money. Kim is forced to veer from the established police system and go after Jin on his own.　 Though the setup hits close to home, the notion of justice and the fundamental problems of Korean society are not dealt with too seriously. The motive for the protagonist’s dogged pursuit of the villain is not detailed. Jin, meanwhile, is a more believable and, unfortunately, familiar criminal, who will go to any lengths to protect his wealth. All in all, the film is a slick, entertaining flick. Its characters have style, and their schemes are elaborate. “Master,” directed by Jo Eui-seok, opens in theaters on Dec. 21.　 By Rumy Doo ()",leebyunghun,5.0,"Lee Byung-hun plays a central role as Chairman Jin, one of the main characters in the film ""Master.""

Lee also addressed the mass candle vigils that have been calling for President Park Geun-hye’s resignation. “I had a belief that those candles would be candles of hope,” he said. Lee’s character in the film, Ahn Sang-goo, is a mobster who ends up being crushed by larger political powers more ruthless and power-hungry than his group of fist-wielding crooks. The 46-year-old actor debuted in 2001 with the military drama “Joint Security Area” and has since forayed into Hollywood, starring in blockbusters like “G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra” in 2009, “Terminator Genisys” in 2015, and “The Magnificent Seven” this year. Among others nominated for the prize were Song Kang-ho for “The Age of Shadows,” Jung Woo-sung for “Asura: The City of Madness,” Kwak Do-won for “The Stranger (Goksung),” and Ha Jung-woo for “Tunnel.” The award for best actress went to Kim Min-hee for her role as the lonely Japanese heiress Hideko in “The Handmaiden.” She beat out Kim Hye-soo, nominated for “Good Bye Single,” Son Ye-jin for “The Last Princess,” Youn Yuh-jung for “Bacchus Lady,” and Han Ye-ri for “Worst Woman.” Kim, whose affair with married film director Hong Sang-soo was recently publicized, was not present at the ceremony. Producer Yoon Seok-chan of “The Handmaiden” received the award on her behalf. “She worked harder than anyone on the film, from 2013 until last year’s sweltering summer,” he said. “It’s not easy to act in a foreign language. I will make sure to deliver the prize to her,” he said. Other award recipients included Park So-dam, who won best supporting actress for “The Priests,” and Japanese actor Kunimura Jun, who won best supporting actor for “The Stranger.” The award for best director went to Na Hong-jin for “The Stranger,” while the award for the best film went to “Inside Men.” The ceremony was moderated by actress Kim Hye-soo and actor Yoo Joon-sang.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1147185,Upcoming crime flick ‘Master’ hits close to home,2016-11-14,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2016/11/14/20161114001016_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Star-studded film features immoral villain, criminal group and dogged detective The hotly anticipated crime flick “Master” features three characters, played by a trio of top stars, who are each “masterful” at what they do. Lee Byung-hun portrays a criminal organization’s maniacal leader who dons a myriad of disguises; Kim Woo-bin is an unpredictable genius hacker and the mastermind behind the organization’s operations; and Kang Dong-won stars as the head detective of a white collar crime investigation unit who doggedly pursues elusive villains. “Things that shouldn’t happen, happen” in Korea today, according to director Jo Eui-seok, who was speaking at a press conference for the upcoming film in Seoul on Monday. “Master” is the latest in a series of crime flicks that do not feel too far from reality, depicting the messy tangle of corrupt politicians and criminals. Last year’s “Inside Men” exposed backdoor ties between a ruthless presidential candidate, a gangster and a journalist who manipulates public opinion with his pen. “Veteran,” also released last year, focused on a psychopathic chaebol heir who buys his way out of murder and equates “ordinary folk” with dogs. “Asura: The City of Madness,” which opened September, portrayed a demented world of power-mad politicians and corrupt cops. In “Master,” the criminals -- dubbed “One Organization” -- funnel astronomic sums of money by lobbying high-ranking public officials and through online manipulation. In an obvious reference to the ongoing political scandal involving President Park Geun-hye and her confidante Choi Soon-sil, the film’s tagline reads: “The biggest ‘gate’ since the country’s founding.” The scandal has been dubbed “Choi Soon-sil gate” here, after the Watergate scandal that rocked the US in the 1970s. Jo said he paid meticulous attention to the characters and the setting to add depth to the film. The organization’s hacking headquarters, for example, is filled with “endless, parallel rows of hackers typing away mechanically,” while the detective’s office is an “open space, with lots of lighting.” Parts of the film were shot in Manila, where the Jones Bridge Highway, the city’s largest, was closed down for the shooting of a high-speed chase scene. Filming also took place in Tondo, the largest slum in Manila, which added to the movie’s atmosphere of filth and squalor, according to Lee. “There was a pig slaughterhouse nearby. It reeked of the smell of blood and rapid decay, due to the humidity,” said Lee. “And we filmed there for over a month, eating lunch in those streets.” The actor, who recently starred in Antoine Fuqua’s “The Magnificent Seven,” is no stranger to depicting morally ambiguous characters, but this new role provided a different kind of challenge, according to Lee. “I think these kind of people operate on a different kind of logic. They have their own, very stubborn philosophy of what’s acceptable and what’s not that’s different from common reasoning. I had to convince myself of that.” The film seeks to deliver a sort of catharsis that “so many Koreans seem to (be in) need of right now,” Lee added. “There will be parts that are very satisfying.” Director Jo previously helmed the 2013 thriller “Cold Eyes,” which follows a special surveillance unit as it tightens in on a most-wanted criminal organization. “Master,” currently in the last stages of filming, is expected to hit theaters in December.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1090344,[Movie review] ‘Seven’ more mediocre than magnificent,2016-09-23,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2016/09/22/20160922001130_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Seven warriors fight for the vulnerable, in a formula that bears revisiting in “The Magnificent Seven.” Akira Kurosawa’s 1954 masterpiece, “Seven Samurai,” begat the classic 1960 Western “The Magnificent Seven,” then a late ’90s TV series and now, a big budget action adventure Western directed by Antoine Fuqua. It’s an appealing concept -- bad guys who can be good, loners who can work together and find camaraderie in a team when it comes to protecting innocents. With the blockbuster cast that Fuqua has assembled, including Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D’Onofrio and Peter Sarsgaard, as well as stunning cinematography by Mauro Fiore, this Western epic remake should be an easy home run. It’s all there -- except for the writing, and that failure is the Achilles’ heel that never lets this version of “The Magnificent Seven” achieve liftoff. Written by “True Detective” scribe Nic Pizzolatto alongside “Expendables” and “The Equalizer” writer Richard Wenk, “The Magnificent Seven” is long on violence and short on story, character development, motivation, and all the things that make any kind of violence satisfying to watch. Therefore, despite all the star power, charisma, and dusty heroics on screen, it’s impossible to care about any of it. The biggest problem is a failure to adequately establish the villain, Bartholomew Bogue. Sarsgaard does his sniveling best with the two scenes he is given to portray Bogue, a tyrannical capitalist who equates democracy with God and the free market, and who has seized the town of Rose Creek for the purposes of gold mining. In a pre-credits opener, we see just what a baddie he is, tormenting children, shooting up a church, and mowing down innocent citizens, but it’s just not enough to justify the endless violence that the seven return, especially since the townspeople are endangered and killed in the melee themselves. To top it off, there’s just not enough backstory and character motivation to believe that these seven would put themselves on the line for this tiny town. Spunky Emma (Haley Bennett) retains the services of warrant officer Sam Chisholm (Washington), who has a deep secret memory of Bogue that sparks his interest in the job. The other six he strong arms into joining him, including Faraday (Pratt) and Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo). He calls on old pal Goodnight Robicheaux (Hawke) and his associate, Chinese fighter Billy Rocks (Lee Byung-hun), and somehow convinces Comanche warrior Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeier) and cowboy Santa Claus Jack Horne (D’Onofrio) to join up too. Why any of them participate in the massacre is frankly, a mystery. The Western genre has always worked as a metaphor -- a fable that allows us to work out our contemporary quandaries through the screen of a period piece. In this “Magnificent Seven,” there’s a celebration of guns that feels both of that era of lawless shootouts, and unfortunately, of this era too. These gunmen protect citizens entitled to freedom from unfettered capitalism. It’s a politically complicated message, at once conservative and liberal, speaking to both sides. While there might be an intriguing moral wrapped in this violent package, without the human element urging the story forward, the “Magnificent Seven” turns out to be rather insignificant after all. By Katie Walsh  Tribune News Service (Distributed by Tribune Content Agency)",leebyunghun,4.0,"The article directly mentions Lee Byung-hun as a cast member in ""The Magnificent Seven,"" specifically noting his role as Billy Rocks, a Chinese fighter who works alongside Goodnight Robicheaux's character.

Filming in the Louisiana swamps was a difficult feat of production, he said. “There were crew members who were in charge of just catching snakes that came to the set,” he said. His co-star Chris Pratt would spend his free time fishing in the swamps and ask the chef on set to prepare it for lunch, Lee recalled. 　 It is the sixth time Lee is starring in a Hollywood film, and the second time Lee is starring in a Western, after the 2008 “The Good, the Bad, the Weird” by Kim Jee-woon, which director Fuqua had seen, Lee said. 　 “He’s a very open director. He was even open to (actors) creating new scenes that weren’t in the script,” he said. 　 “He’s so cool, his look hs very unique,” director Fuqua said on Lee via video message. “Very funny, charming guy, very physical. He came up and we talked and right away, I thought, ‘He’s a cool guy.’”　 Lee’s character is engaged in a bromance of sorts with the washed-out sharpshooter Goodnight Robicheaux played by Ethan Hawke. “We became good friends in real life,” Lee said of Hawke. “When we weren’t filming, we would have a drink together. ... I used to be a fan of his, so becoming his friend was a great experience.” The film is a modern remake of the 1960 film of the same title. There is a stylishness that is unique to director Fuqua in the remake, Lee said. “It’s an exhilarating action flick.” “There are so many superhero films these days with computer graphics effects and blue screens,” said Lee. “But acting out all the action sequences in real life in an analog fashion was extremely difficult.” On his international career, Lee said he hopes to continue to “take on new challenges.” “The Magnificent Seven” premiered on Sept. 8 as the opening film of the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/1081697,‘Magnificent Seven’ remake kicks off Toronto film fest,2016-09-09,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2016/09/09/20160909000957_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"TORONTO (AFP) -- Double Oscar-winner Denzel Washington and a motley band of gunslingers opened the Toronto film festival Thursday, blazing trails in a much-anticipated remake of the 1960 Western “The Magnificent Seven.” The film festival, which runs through Sept.18, is the largest in North America and has become a launchpad for Oscar-conscious studios and distributors, attracting hundreds of filmmakers and actors to the red carpet in Canada’s largest city. Nearly 400 feature and short films from 83 countries will be screened at the festival. Director Antoine Fuqua’s film is a reimagining of the Western classic that starred Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson -- which in turn was a remake of Akira Kurosawa’s Japanese-language epic “Seven Samurai.” In the latest version, Washington plays Sam Chisolm, a bounty hunter who leads his crew to liberate a Wild West town from the clutches of an evil industrialist played by Peter Sarsgaard, who also appears at the festival in “Jackie,” and his private army of henchmen. While initially motivated by cash offered by townswoman Emma Cullen (played by Haley Bennett), these swashbucklers end up taking a principled stand against greed and hegemony to save the fledgling town. Fuqua told AFP during post-production in April that he hoped to dispel a mythology of the American frontier propagated by Hollywood, that it was populated by ranchers, lawmen and outlaws battling for money or land on behalf of White America. The real Wild West’s racial makeup was actually a melting pot of Europeans, Chinese, Mexicans, Native Americans and blacks. “Westerns change for the times they’re in,” Fuqua told a press conference ahead of the gala screening of the film in Toronto. “We made our film based on the world we live in right now,” he said. “If we were sticking to just one way of doing something, all Westerns would be all white guys looking like John Wayne.” The action-packed film also stars Chris Pratt as a card shark and explosives enthusiast, Ethan Hawke (also at the festival in “Maudie”) as a sharpshooter, Vincent D’Onofrio in the role of a tracker, and Korea’s Lee Byung-hun as a knife-throwing assassin. Washington and Fuqua have collaborated before, notably with Hawke on “Training Day,” which also premiered at the Toronto festival and went on to earn Washington a best actor Oscar in 2001 for his performance as a rogue cop in Los Angeles. Washington earned his first Oscar in 1990 for his supporting role in the civil war drama “Glory.” The two also paired up in 2014 for Fuqua’s adaptation of the 1980s television series “The Equalizer,” about a loner who dispenses justice from the barrel of a gun. The film earned mediocre reviews and nearly $200 million at the box office. Pressed about the subtle racial complexity of the film in a time of racial tension in America, Fuqua quipped, “I just wanted to see Denzel Washington on a horse ... that would be an event.” More seriously, he added, “Denzel walks into a room, the room stops. Clint Eastwood walks into a room, the room stops. Is it because he’s a gunslinger or the color of his skin? We’ll let the audience decide.” Toronto film festival co-director Piers Handling said of the film, “It’s an interesting metaphor for what’s going on in America right now.” This year’s Toronto film festival also shines a spotlight on American politics, youth radicalization, racism, feminism and alien arrivals. Films being positioned for accolades include the new Denis Villeneuve sci-fi movie “Arrival,” and Oliver Stone’s “Snowden” about former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden’s enormous 2013 leak revealing the extent of government snooping on private data. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone‘s performances as a jazz musician and an aspiring actress in the bewitching musical “La La Land,” which opened the Venice film festival, has also stirred up a frenzy. “American Pastoral,” Ewan McGregor’s directorial debut looking back at an ideal family torn by the upheavals of the 1960s, is generating tremendous buzz, as is “Lion” -- the true story of a boy separated from his family who goes searching for home 25 years on.",leebyunghun,3.0,"The article mentions Lee Byung-hun in a supporting context as one of the cast members of ""The Magnificent Seven,"" describing him as ""a knife-throwing assassin.""

The added footage to the story -- which follows a deeply corrupt triangular conspiracy involving politics, corporate interests and the media -- focuses mainly on providing personal histories and context for the complex relationships between the main characters. Titled “Inside Men: The Original,” the extended film is actually a whittled-down form of the initial director’s cut, which was reportedly 3 hours and 40 minutes. “We cut out the dragging scenes to make it three hours,” director Woo Min-ho told press at a prerelease preview. “When we cut it to 130 minutes (for the theatrical version), there were some spots where I felt I was cutting corners to hide certain mistakes. The three-hour version shows the uncut scenes, so I feel a bit exposed.” “When I saw the two-hour version, I got the impression that it was very rough, very gritty,” commented actor Lee Byung-hun, who plays gangster Ahn Sang-gu in the film. “When I heard we were releasing a three-hour version, I was worried that it would be a bit boring. But watching the film, I think it’s even more rough and gritty.” Baek Yoon-sik’s portrayal of columnist Lee Gang-hui received the most additional screen time with “The Original,” and he said at the press conference that he was finally “satisfied.” “The film shows how Ahn Sang-gu and Lee Gang-hui first got to know each other, and I enjoyed that. I also liked the scenes that portrayed the relationship between colleagues at a daily newspaper,” Baek said. The most interesting additions are the new opening and closing scenes. In the opening shot, Lee Byung-hun is shown giving an interview to a reporter before a crucial scene in the film where he exposes the central crime in the plot; in the final scene, Baek Yoon-sik performs a semi-monologue in the form of a one-sided telephone call. Both scenes give the film a darker twist, and director Woo said the last scene in particular was a dilemma. “I didn’t want the audience to leave the theater feeling despair,” he said. “The original intent of the film was simply to increase awareness (about the corruption around us) and give the message not to give up, but I lost confidence and had cut it out for the theatrical version.” The new scene finishes the film on a more resigned note. As of Dec. 28, “Inside Men” had been watched by over 6.9 million moviegoers, making it the second-most successful adults-only film in Korean box office history after “Friend.” “Inside Men: The Original” opens on Dec. 31.

Based on the eponymous unfinished webtoon by Yoon Tae-ho, who also wrote “Moss” (which became a film in 2010) and “Misaeng” (adapted as a TV drama last year), the film takes the audience down a seemingly inescapable rabbit hole of immorality without cutting corners. The scenes are sexually and violently explicit, with secret meetings and decadent parties shrouded in sinister darkness by award-winning cinematographer Ko Rak-seon (“The Fatal Encounter,” “The Face Reader”). Luckily, director Woo Min-ho does a good job of taking Yoon’s unfinished series and pulling the characters together into a coherent storyline of betrayal and revenge. The fast-paced second half of the movie, decorated with a half-expected yet still surprising twist, plucks the audience out from their collective horror and brings them back into the comfort zone of a commercial thriller. “The film is very different from the cartoon,” Woo admitted at a press conference before the film’s release. “The original cartoon was very strong, and I tried to keep that strength in my plot.” “While the cartoon focused on the corrupt systems existing in Korea, the film focused on the intense competition between the characters themselves,” he said. And it is the characters that carry the movie, thanks to an expertly cast ensemble. Baek Yoon-sik plays kingmaker columnist Lee Gang-hui, who writes influential articles that sway public opinion to fit his needs. The prolific Lee Gyoung-young depicts politician Jang Pil-woo, a presidential favorite who widens his network with unsavory favors. Cho Seung-woo plays prosecutor Woo Jang-hun, who is determined to rise through the ranks despite his humble background, and Lee Byung-hun stars as Ahn Sang-gu, a thug fixer that does the bidding of powerful people with deep pockets. All four actors give stellar performances, but it is Lee Byung-hun who shines through -- so much that even the unforgiving Korean online crowd has praised his acting in early reviews despite recent personal scandals that had made him a public enemy. “I don’t like Lee as a person, but as an actor, he’s the best,” reads one comment. “In the end, Lee Byung-hun is Lee Byung-hun,” reads another. From his carefully tailored looks to the way he eats ramen and the jokes he ad-libbed onscreen, Lee’s character leaves the strongest impression, while also providing comic relief. Speaking to reporters, Lee said that he put a lot of thought into creating the character. “When I first got the script, Sang-gu was a very different person. He was more heavy and mobster-like than humorous. I thought the script was great, but I felt that the fast pace of the film didn’t give the audience any time to breathe,” he said. “I wanted to create a character and situations that provided those breaks, and the director gave me permission to take it in a more humorous direction.” That humorous touch was the cherry on top for “Inside Men,” which successfully merged the deep, socially conscious message of cartoonist Yoon Tae-ho with the commercial movie style of Woo Min-ho. Even with all its darkness, “Inside Men” is an entertaining ride. “Inside Men” opened Thursday.

Years after his initial betrayal, he is hunted by two women who were victims of his actions -- the blind swordswoman Wol-so (Jeon) and her protege Hong-yi (Kim), who trains herself to take revenge on her parents’ killers. The film has been creating a buzz not only for its all-star cast but also because it is the first domestic film starring Lee Byung-hun since a scandal. Last year, the actor was blackmailed by two young women who taped him allegedly making inappropriate comments to them and behaving untowardly. The movie was initially slated for release last December, but had to be pushed back due to the backlash from Lee’s scandal. “To be honest, I’m not a fan of martial arts epics,” Lee said at a news conference in Seoul on Friday ahead of the film’s Aug. 13 release. Adding that he did not want to do another historical film after “Masquerade” (2012) because of the difficulties stemming from historical makeup and costumes. “But when I read the script, I loved the story. It has very strong drama.” Actress Jeon agreed with Lee. “The drama was very appealing. I thought of it as a melodrama, because although Wol-so devotes her life to finding justice, she could not have been so determined if she hadn’t been in love.” The action in the film is intense -- actress Kim said she had to do wire action on every one of her 80 days of filming -- but according to director Park, the true appeal of the film is in its characters. “I thought that martial arts movies needed more density in their narrative,” Park said. “I paid more attention to the narrative in this film.” “The audience will enjoy the film just watching the excellent performances of these three actors,” he added. Jeon and Kim are two of the most sought-after actresses in Korea, both having made an appearance at the Cannes Film Festival this year for “The Shameless” and “Coin Locker Girl,” respectively.

""I'm feeling the importance of this attention more keenly than any time before as I spend time in repenting for giving you a big disappointment."" In September, Lee was blackmailed by two women demanding that the actor pay them 5 billion won ($4.28 million) in exchange for not uploading online a video clip allegedly showing the three of them drinking and making sexual remarks.

There is also an epic battle between the two Terminators, which I think people will enjoy.”  　Meanwhile, Clarke described the prospect of playing Sarah Connor as a “double-edged sword.” 　”I definitely felt a huge amount of pressure going into the movie, but one of the reasons I wanted to take on the role was because the iconic-ness that Linda Hamilton created in the first two movies inspired me,“ she said, referring to the first actress who brought Sarah Connor to life. ”The thing I prepared for most with this movie was that this Sarah Connor had such a different life experience coming into this movie. The Terminator went back to try and kill her parents at such a young age that it‘s changed her character, while maintaining the essence of who she was.“ 　In the film, John Connor (Jason Clarke), the leader of the human resistance, sends his right-hand Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back in time to protect his mother Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke). To Reese’s surprise, Sarah is already being guarded by a T-800 Guardian (Arnold Schwarzenegger). 　Together, they kick-start a plan to bring down the machines with the help of the Guardian. 　Clarke said that the relationship between Sarah and the Guardian, or Pops, was central to her character. ”It‘s a beautiful father-daughter relationship that anchors this huge action spectacle of a movie and gives a gorgeous heart to it,“ she said, saying that she loved being able to bring out the sensitive side of the fierce character. 　Fans in Korea will have a little extra fun with the movie, with a brief but very interesting fight sequence in the first half featuring Korean star Lee Byung-hun, who plays a T-1000 Terminator. 　(Lee) was such a joy to work with. He was incredible,” said Clarke. “There weren’t very many special effects for the movements that he naturally had.” 　“I remember vividly that first sequence I got to film with him. He was kind of mind-blowing. I spent a lot of time just watching him and reminding myself that I had to be acting.” 　Schwarzenegger said he believed the continued success of the “Terminator” series could be credited to people‘s admiration for the machines. 　“If you think about the first Terminator, the things he did was just extraordinary. Even though it was a villain, people admired the strength. They wanted a part of them to be like a machine, to have that memory, that quick thinking, quick reactions, quick solutions to problems and to have those fighting skills and less vulnerabilities.” 　“People are fascinated with the character, and that’s why they keep coming back to see the movie.” 　However, he did not say whether a sequel would be coming. 　“I only take one Terminator at a time,” Schwarzenegger said. “I do not even think of another one. Even though I (would) look forward to it, we have to make sure there‘s a demand by the audience, by the fans, rather than us just saying we’ll do another ‘Terminator.’ The important thing is that people enjoy this one, and that it‘s successful worldwide.” 　“Terminator Genisys” opened in local theaters Thursday.

As of Monday, the film attracted 1,136,866 viewers and earned 8.74 billion won ($7.93 million), according to the official box-office tracker Korean Film Council. During the weekend of March 27-29, the film accounted for 48.3 percent of total box office sales, while last week’s topper “Whiplash” accounted for 14.9 percent, sliding to the second spot. The coming-of-age film centers on three close friends who all turn 20 years old. Chi-ho (Kim Woo-bin) is jobless and has no goals in life, other than sleeping with as many women as possible. Dong-woo (Lee Jun-ho) dreams of becoming a comic artist, but due to his family’s financial problems, he might have to give it up.

Film director Frank Capra once said that movies were one of the three universal languages, along with mathematics and music. Great films bring all walks of life into a common pool of fun and ethos, to enrich the modern times. Myung Films, too, has sought to produce great films with both fun and ethos, which can bring together cinemagoers at home and abroad. Bold themes, an efficient production system and creative marketing are Myung Films’ strength. Founded in 1995, the film producer has made 36 films of diverse genres, including social drama “Cart (2014),” retro-romance “Architecture 101” (2012), animation film “Leafie, a Hen Into the Wild” (2011) and inter-Korean drama “Joint Security Area” (2000). Film critics credit Myung Films for its contribution to enhance the development and industrialization of the Korean film industry for the past two decades. The company has raked in phenomenal success out of what was once considered the “genres doomed for mediocre,” such as rom-melo and children’s animation. Film “Architecture 101,” for instance, hit 4.1 million views in eight weeks, becoming the first Korean romance drama to break the 4 million mark. The movie swept six awards in five film awards and closed the Shanghai International Film Festival in 2012. Children’s animation film “Leafie, a Hen Into the Wild” snagged six awards here and globally, including the silver in the Switzerland-based Castellinaria International Young People’s Film Festival and the best animation award from the Asian Pacific Film Festival. The animation film drew a record-high 2.2 million viewers, elevating homegrown animation to the global level. Besides hitting jackpots in the conventionally “arid” genres, Myung Films also ventured to explore the new social movements and themes. In 1997, the film production company launched the romance drama “The Contact,” starring actor Han Suk-kyu and actress Jeon Do-yeon, a novel attempt to project the Internet-friendly age of “N generation culture.” Three years later, the company produced “JSA: Joint Security Area,” directed by award-winning Park Chan-wook, starring actors Song Gang-ho, Lee Byung-hun and actress Lee Young-ae, to cinematize the sorrow of the divided nation. In addition to hitting the jackpot with its own diversity and non-blockbuster films, Myung Films has engaged in fostering the Korean diversity films. While many of Korean diversity movies wish to deliver powerful message through not-so-friendly plots and genres, they often suffer from the increasing polarization of the commercial and the diversity movies. Due to the widespread risk-avoiding sentiment among investors, financial difficulties are the biggest hurdle for diversity film producers and small and medium-sized distributors. Lee Eun, chief executive of Myung Films, is a consulting council member of the cultural content unit of the Industrial Bank of Korea. The IBK, a bank tailored to small and medium enterprises, has been provided financial partnership for promising movies in the forefront and helping the Korean content sector become a value-added service industry.

The Seoul Central District Court ruled Wednesday that comedian Lee Soo-geun, who was sentenced to probation for illegal gambling in 2013, must compensate the company he was representing with 700 million won. The ruling comes after the automotive company Bullsone filed a 20 billion won damage suit against Lee, claiming reparation for his part in “tarnishing the company’s image” as well as the financial losses the company suffered as a result of his social misconduct. Lee is only one of many celebrities who have been rapped by the courts for allegedly violating their legal duty to “maintain a positive conduct” as models for their respective advertisers. Last week, the court ordered actress Lee Seung-yeon, who was put on probation for drug abuse in 2013, to compensate the company she was representing by paying 100 million won. K-pop girl group Kara, who was entangled in a legal battle with its agency last year, was forced to pay 50 million won to the company that the group endorsed. Companies that hired actress Clara -- who is currently in a controversial dispute with her agency -- as their model, are reportedly preparing to file a damage suit against the actress. What exactly are the legal grounds for the celebrities to compensate the companies they represent for what may seem like “private issues?” One major source of legal power comes from the contents of the original contract signed between both sides. Typically included in such contracts is a key clause stipulating that the star must maintain a positive conduct and refrain from any behavior that will damage the image of the company or its product. Such a clause gives the advertiser legal power to file a damage suit against the hired model, who may have harmed the advertiser’s reputation through whatever form of public misconduct. In determining the degree of responsibility as well as the amount of compensation that must be paid, the presence or absence of action-specific clauses is important, legal experts say. Most contracts include a clause that outlines specific procedures for different situations -- in case the celebrity is indicted for criminal activities or commits acts publicly deemed immoral, the celebrity must pay back twice the amount originally received for the modeling service. When such clauses are absent, the settlement process becomes more complex. The prosecution must provide evidence that clearly shows the amount of financial and public damage suffered due to lapses by the celebrity. Perhaps more important is defining the so-called notion of “positive conduct and behavior” and its boundaries. For the notion is by nature subjective, it is often difficult to draw the line between a celebrity’s right to privacy and freedom of action, and the profit-related concerns of the company that hired them as models. More often than not, a number of unfortunate celebrities suffer serious damage to their public image due to issues that are out of their control. One such victim is actor Lee Byung-hun, who is married to actress Lee Min-Jung. Lee’s reputation plummeted when video footage suggesting that he was involved in a romantic relationship with a singer and model began circulating. Though the court later proved that the two women blackmailed Lee for financial gains, he ended up losing many key advertising contracts as public opinion had turned against him. To protect the rights of both the celebrities and the companies that hire them as models, it is important that both parties draw up clauses as specifically as possible when signing an advertising contract, legal experts said. By Sohn Ji-young ()",leebyunghun,4.0,"The article directly mentions Lee Byung-hun as an example of a celebrity who lost advertising contracts due to a scandal, even though he was later proven to be a victim of blackmail.

Based on a survey of 80 experts, observers and entertainment industry insiders, conducted by The Herald Business, the sister paper of The Korea Herald, here are the four stars whose name you will be hearing a lot throughout the year. What’s next for Kim Soo-hyun? After a flurry of leading roles in hit TV dramas “Dream High,” “Moon Embracing the Sun,” and the wildly successful “My Love from the Star,” Kim has established himself as arguably the most sought-after actor under 30 in South Korea.   His most recent role as the charmingly cynical undercover alien Do Min-joon alongside Jun Ji-hyun, who plays the bewitching actress Chun Song-yi, cemented his celebrity status not only nationwide but also overseas. Following the show’s explosive success abroad, Kim spent a large part of 2014 touring Asia to meet fans. The actor wrapped up his lucrative year by winning Best Actor at the SBS Drama Awards. Ten months after his last role, however, Kim is yet to announce his next big project. Though considered for upcoming TV shows “A Scholar Walks the Night” and “Doctor Frankenstein,” he ended up declining both parts. Observers say that 2015 will be a pivotal year in shaping the remainder of the actor’s career. Kim’s next move will be to follow up on his meteoric rise and carefully select what may be his last work before his mandatory military service. Yim Si-wan: from K-pop idol to actor Originally a member of 9-member boy band Z:EA, Yim Si-wan first demonstrated his flair for acting in a supporting role in “Moon Embracing the Sun.” In 2014, however, Yim fully came into his own and enjoyed massive popularity when he took up the lead in the critically and publically acclaimed tvN drama “Misaeng (Incomplete Life).” Portraying the struggles of Jang Geu-rae, a meek but hardworking employee in a fiercely competitive work environment, Yim won over the sympathies of the typical office worker in modern Korea. Amid a flood of offers, Yim, too, is said to be reviewing his options before deciding on his next role. EXO readies for comeback Setting themselves apart in the thick of idol bands that flood the K-pop scene in ever greater numbers, group EXO enjoyed outstanding popularity both in Korea and overseas. According to German music ranking company Media Traffic, EXO’s single “Overdose” sold more than 447,000 copies across the globe, a significant achievement in today’s grim record market. While EXO did go through a rough patch last year with two Chinese members, Kris and Luhan, leaving the group, the remaining 10 were able to dispel fans’ worries by delivering an immaculate performance and announcing their comeback for 2015 in December. No further details of the comeback have been released. Lee Byung-hun’s Hollywood foray Mired in a scandal involving an extra-marital fling and an alleged blackmailing attempt, Lee Byung-hun had a difficult 2014. Even amid such domestic entanglement, experts anticipate Lee’s further rise abroad. Lee is among the few Korean stars to have reaped some success in Hollywood, starring in the “G.I. Joe” films as ninja assassin Storm Shadow. Coming up this year is “Terminator: Genisys” where Lee plays the shape-shifting robot assassin T-1000 alongside worldwide celebrities including Arnold Schwarzenegger.

The first hearing on the celebrity blackmailing case, held at the Seoul Central District Court, aroused public criticism nationwide of all three celebrities involved: Lee Byung-hun, Lee Ji-yeon and Kim Da-hee of girl group GLAM. The trial comes a year after Lee Byung-hun married actress Lee Min-jung in Aug. 10, 2013.  The prosecutor claimed that Lee Ji-yeon, 24, and Kim Dae-hee, 20, were introduced to Lee Byung-hun by a common friend surnamed Seok in July this year. When the 44-year-old actor text-messaged “Let’s not see each other again” to Lee Ji-yeon, she demanded 5 billion won ($4.7 million) in exchange for the video footage containing his lewd remarks. The defendant’s attorney, however, refuted the prosecutor’s claim that she approached Lee Byung-hun for financial favors from the start. The truth is, the attorney alleged, that the two were in loving relationship. The attorney claimed, “Lee Byung Hun tried to go beyond ‘touching’ her, and when she disagreed, he bid farewell,” implying that the actor demanded a sexual relationship from the model. The model’s attorney also refuted the prosecutor’s claim that she demanded that Lee Byung-hun buy her a house. “It was Lee Byung-hyun who coaxed Lee Ji-yeon to look for a new house, when he was demanding a sexual relationship from her,” the attorney said. The attorney of Kim Da-hee, another defendant, alleged that the singer was not aware of the illegality of selling the video footage to Dispatch, an online tabloid. Kim’s attorney told the judge, “Lee Ji-yeon told Kim that they could make 1 billion won for handing over the lewd video of Lee Byung-hun to Dispatch, leading to Kim’s misconception that the act was legally acceptable.” The second hearing will take place on Nov. 11 at 2 p.m. The prosecutor requested that Seok, the common acquaintance of the three celebrities, take the stand as a witness.

The 24-year-old model surnamed Lee and 20-year-old Dahee of girl group Glam attempted to blackmail the 44-year-old married man after he turned down the request, according to prosecutors. The women were detained on charges of conspiracy. The prosecutors said the women were introduced to Lee Byung-hun on July 1 at a dinner gathering. Afterwards, the three met several times for drinks. The women thought Lee was sexually interested in the model, and conspired to demand new housing and cash in exchange for sexual services, according to the prosecutors. The prosecution claimed that only two days after the initial encounter, the two agreed and set up the plan to catch the actor and model having a sexual conversation on video, in case he declined their offer. The two set up a smartphone in a kitchen sink in order to record the model embracing Lee Byung-hun, according to reports. But the model did not have the chance to get into the actor’s arms. Model Lee asked him to give her a house by saying, “I want to move to a home by myself.” However, the actor later sent her a Kakao Talk message that he did not wish to see her again, prosecutors stated. Then on Aug. 29, the two women called the actor to the model’s house and threatened him with the lewd video, authorities claimed. The two allegedly showed the actor two large, empty suitcases and demanded that he give them five billion won ($4.7 million) in cash. But the actor refused and reported the case to the police immediately after he left the model’s house. The two female celebrities allegedly have been financially troubled. The model did not have steady source of income and the girl group member owed about 300 million won to her agency.

Lee also did not choose a high-end dress but wore a vintage wedding dress which she had bought in the U.S. for a reasonable price. The dress, seemingly simple, was decorated with various lace.

Following this year’s success, the country’s major film producers recently announced their lineups for 2014. And it seems like local moviegoers will be bombarded with period blockbusters next year. Some of the most anticipated films of 2014 are period dramas, including Cannes-winning actress Jeon Do-yeon’s upcoming martial arts flick “Hyeopnyeo” and “Battle of Myeongryang,” a film about legendary Joseon admiral Yi Sun-sin (1545-1598). In the past few years, period dramas have been enjoying increasing popularity in Korea. In 2011, director Kim Han-min’s period drama “War of the Arrows” became the highest grossing Korean film of the year, attracting a total of 7,470,633 viewers. In the following year, another period drama “Masquerade,” a fictionalized account of King Gwanghae, the 15th ruler of Joseon, became a massive hit ― becoming the second highest grossing film of that year. “I think the genre is popular because it lets (the moviemakers) combine what is fiction and what is non-fiction,” said Jeong Seong-yeop from Lotte Entertainment. “It gives you a lot of room for imagination, while also giving an opportunity to offer glimpses into Korean history.” Among the period dramas to be released next year, “Hyeopnyeo” stars top actor Lee Byung-hun, whose performance as the hapless king in “Masquerade” received much praise, alongside Jeon. Emerging actress Kim Go-eun, who swept Best New Actress prizes in 2012 for her role as a beautiful, reckless teenager in director Jung Ji-woo’s sensual drama “Eungyo,” will appear as Jeon’s daughter. Jeon, who stars as swordswoman and a mother during Korea’s Goryeo Kingdom (918-1392) in the upcoming movie, worked with Lee Byung-hun in 1999 for director Lee Young-jae’s “The Harmonium in My Memory.” It is the first time that the two are co-starring in the same film since then. Following his success with “War of the Arrows,” director Kim Han-min is to return next year with “Battle of Myeongryang.” The film stars “Oldboy” and “I Saw the Devil” actor Choi Min-sik as the iconic Joseon admiral Yi Sun-sin. It mainly follows the famous 1597 Battle of Myeongryang during the Japanese invasion of Korea (1592-1598), where Yi managed to destroy a total of 133 Japanese warships with only 13 ships remaining in his command. The battle, which took place in the Myeongryang Strait off the southwest coast of the Korean Peninsula, is considered one of the greatest victories of Yi. Meanwhile, popular actress Son Ye-jin (“My Wife Got Married,” “White Night”) is returning as a pirate in upcoming period blockbuster “Pirates.” The 10 billion-won project, directed by Lee Seok-hoon (“Dancing Queen”), features adventure with two groups ― one made of pirates and the other of bandits ― who desperately try to hunt down a whale that swallowed the royal seal of Joseon. Local fans of popular actor Hyun Bin (“Come Rain, Come Shine,” “Late Autumn”) will be delighted to hear that he is returning next year as King Jeongjo, the 22nd ruler of Joseon, in a period drama titled “Yeogrin” (The King’s Wrath). The fictionalized film, directed by former TV producer-director Lee Jae-gyoo (“The Legendary Police Woman,” “Beethoven Virus”), deals with the death of the king, who is regarded as one of the most successful rulers of the Joseon Dynasty.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/5932,Becoming ‘Storm Shadow’ in Hollywood,2013-03-12,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2013/03/12/20130312000982_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Actor Lee Byung-hun talks about making of his second Hollywood film ‘G.I. Joe 2’ Director Park Chan-wook has been there, and so has director Kim Jee-woon. Hollywood may not be an undiscovered place for Korean directors as of this year: They’ve made their debut films there, released them, and experienced the red-carpet glamour. Hollywood, however, still remains foreign to most local actors. One of the few exceptions is top actor Lee Byung-hun, whose performance in his 2009 Hollywood debut “G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra” left a mark. The actor is now ahead of the opening of the sci-fi flick’s sequel, “G.I. Joe 2: The Retaliation,” where he returns as Storm Shadow ― the famous heroic character who works as a ninja bodyguard doing epic stunts. Lee, who enjoyed much success with the Korean period drama “Masquerade” released last year ― the film remains the third-highest grossing Korean film of all time ― says it was his “curiosity” that drew him to Hollywood.   “It was more of curiosity (than ambition),” said the 42-year-old actor during a group interview with the local press in Seoul on Monday. “Even after my second movie, I am still curious. I still wonder what I can actually offer in Hollywood and how much farther I can go with my career there. I’m up for new challenges and opportunities.” Shooting his second Hollywood film required a number of things, including mastering every script line in perfect American English and getting used to the Hollywood filmmaking system ― which is vastly different from the one in Korea. Both directors Park and Kim have shared their difficulties getting used to the system, which they experienced while shooting “Stoker” and “The Last Stand,” respectively. Unlike the Korean film industry, where all the crew members work on the set until the director is satisfied with the shoots, working in Hollywood strictly requires start and finish, each day’s work is done on time. Director Kim said the experience was “lonely” and “extremely challenging.” Lee said it was “efficient but intimidating sometimes.” “Director Park and Kim were all in the U.S. while I was shooting this film,” said Lee. “Both of them would often text me (when they were frustrated) and say, ‘I am going nuts’ or ‘I could just pack everything and go home now.’ I’d giggle whenever I received the texts. “But seriously speaking, I think getting used to the system must have been much harder for them than it was for me. From what I’ve seen, being a film director in Korea is just totally different from being a film director in Hollywood.” Unlike Park Chan-wook and Kim Jee-woon, Lee got himself out there without an interpreter. Throughout the shooting process, he communicated with all of the U.S. crew members without any help from a third party. Director Jon Chu, who worked with Lee on the film, in fact said the actor surprisingly spoke “perfect English.” “I remember him coming into the project and everyone was like, ‘Oh, he doesn’t speak that much English,’” Chu said during a group interview with the Korean press during his visit to Seoul on Monday. “So I thought this would be interesting how we would interact with each other. But then he came in for a meeting and he spoke perfect English. There he talked about how he wanted the character to be more emotional and real. He wanted to create a rawer, rage-filled character rather than just a cartoon character. It was great. We could talk about the things below the surface.” Lee Byung-hun is undoubtedly one of Korea’s most celebrated film stars, having starred in more than 40 films and TV drama series. He is noted for his strong presence and nuanced acting style. Though he appears as an action hero in the upcoming movie, his previous roles include an intelligence agent, an arrogant business man falling for an orphaned woman, and a Joseon-period jester who ends up standing in for his ill ruler. “I loved that he could be really strong and powerful but at the same time have a sense of humor about himself,” Chu said about Lee’s performance in Kim Jee-woon’s 2008 film “The Good, the Bad, the Weird,” where the actor appears as a villain. “I loved that you were scared of him but also felt for him. That combination was very rare for me because usually I think in American action movies you are either a villain or a hero. The in-betweens are tough. And what I loved about Lee Byung-hun’s performance in all these movies is that he plays the line very well. He plays it and goes back and forth. And that takes a real artist.” The G.I. Joe films are based on American board game company Hasbro’s toy and cartoon series. Lee’s character, Storm Shadow, is a Japanese-American who used to serve in the U.S. Army’s special operations group. “He seems cold and cynical, mostly because of this traumatic experience he had in the past,” Lee said. “And there is this scene in the movie where he simply explodes with all the suppressed emotions. That’s one of the scenes that I considered the most important.” “His acting style is very strong and he can be very intense,” said American pro-wrestler and actor Dwayne Johnson, who starred in the movie with Lee. The actor said he was unaware of Lee’s stardom in Asia until director Chu “educated him” about it. “One of the most impressive things about Lee is that he is a very, very disciplined actor who takes his job incredibly seriously. Even in our world of cosmic mythology, he brings a very nice way to perform (his role). I’m very impressed with the guy. A nice guy, too.” “G.I. Joe 2: Retaliation” opens in theaters on March 28.

https://www.koreaherald.com/article/3348,‘IRIS II’ set to explode onto the small screen,2013-02-07,https://wimg.heraldcorp.com/content/default/2013/02/07/20130207000895_0.jpg?type=h&h=240,"Sequel to popular TV drama promises to be a gripping action bonanza Viewers disappointed by the spin-off of the 2009 spy-thriller hit “IRIS,” might not have much riding on the sequel to the pioneer action original, but the tight, well-edited highlights reel that ran at the “IRIS II” press conference in Seoul on Thursday promises a seat-gripping, intense, muscular and slick series. The action is definitely bigger. Explosions singe the screen. Fight scenes are gritty, tough and well choreographed, with no excess flourishes. The cinematography is silver screen-grade, all the more heightened by overseas locales like Hungary, Cambodia, Japan and the endless window-smashing, helicopter-leaping, kick-ass hand-to-hand combat stunts that squeeze out any room for boredom. Sure, there is definitely a fair share of melodramatic romance in the mix, with leads Jang Hyuk and Lee Da-hey kissing on a bridge at night and frolicking in the snow, and, if the plot plays out as planned, with B2ST’s Yoon Du-jun’s also vying for the affections of Lee’s heroine, NSS agent Ji Soo-yeon. Throughout the sneak preview, action veteran Jang Hyuk held up his end of the bargain with no-frills, all-out stunts. Jang’s “The Slave Hunters” co-star and “IRIS II” heroine Lee Da-hey proved she is game for action as well with strong moves and aerial jumps. At the press event, Lee revealed the hardships of prepping for all those stunts, saying, “We were practicing at action school together and then I noticed that Jang Hyuk had a lot of blood, right there on his forehead, but he just wiped it off like it was nothing, I guess because he has done so much martial arts and action himself.” “Every moment is hit-and-miss,” said Jang. “I always am alert when filming.” “There were many dangerous scenes in as much as the scale of the sequel is more grandiose,” said Jang, recalling a particularly nerve-racking moment. “When filming a scene where I roll over a car, at one time my leg got caught in the car and I found myself being dragged by it. That moment was a bit risky, but thankfully we got it in the second take.” Now, a good series cannot float without a strong plot, and it is in this area where “IRIS II” might fail to live up to viewers’ expectations. The sequel opens three years after the as-of-yet unsolved demise of the first installment’s hero, NSS agent Kim Hyun-jun (Lee Byung-hun). NSS Task Force A Team Head Jung Yoo-geon (Jang Hyuk) and his team are busy trying to unveil the true identity behind the secret organization IRIS while also acting as bodyguards at a South and North Korea summit. Operative Jung (Jang Hyuk) must also transport a rogue NSS director to safety, but is ambushed by IRIS and mysteriously disappears. The sudden return of Jung, presumed dead-in-action, promises to add fuel to the plot. It is when Jung reappears that fellow NSS agent Lee Ji-yeon (Lee Da-hey) discovers that Jung’s disappearance is all part of a large-scale conspiracy. While the story might come across as a little bit been there, done that (especially since “IRIS” lead Lee Byung-hun’s hero also pulled a disappearing act in the original), it is hard to tell without seeing the series just how many similarities there will be between the upcoming sequel and “IRIS,” and its spin-off “ATHENA: Goddess of War.” Should the plot play out in all too familiar fashion, ratings might taper off as the drama progresses. That is precisely the scenario that Chung Tae-won, producer at the drama’s production company Taewon Entertainment, wishes to avoid. After “IRIS” made it big on the small screen in 2009, “we did a spin-off ‘ATHENA,’” said Chung. “At first the response was explosive, but as the episodes aired, viewer ratings declined. We are trying not to repeat the same mistakes this time around.” Chung revealed that he and the team are continually reviewing the script, looking to see if anything is missing, and if there is anything to fill in those gaps. “We are into filming our 12th episode, but we are still doing extra filming for episodes one and two.” Chung also promised that “IRIS II” would be “more realistic” than its predecessors. “IRIS II” starts airing Feb. 13 on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 10 p.m. on KBS 2 TV. Jang Hyuk, Lee Da-hey, Lee Bum-soo, MBLAQ’s Lee Joon, B2ST’s Yoon Du-jun will be starring in the series.

South Korean actor Lee Byung-hun was selected as the best actor of 2012 in an annual poll released Wednesday.
Lee received the most support with 37.6 percent of the 1,700 people aged 13 and older who were polled in a Gallup Korea survey conducted last month, the Seoul-based pollster said.
Lee also won the best actor honor at the 49th Daejong (Grand Bell) Film Awards for his title role in the Korean costume drama “Gwanghae: the Man Who Became King” that has sold 12 million tickets to become the third most-viewed Korean film of all time.
He rose to stardom in other Asian countries for his roles in local TV series “Beautiful Days” (2001), “All In” (2003) and “Iris” (2009). The 42-year-old also starred in the 2009 Hollywood blockbuster “G.I.Joe: The Rise of Cobra.”
“Lee received the most support from all age groups, except for teenage females,” Gallup Korea said in a press release. “Support rates were especially high among men in their 20s with 53.3 percent and women in their 30s with 49 percent.”
The box-office hit about King Gwanghae, the 15th ruler of Korea’s last kingdom, the Joseon kingdom (1392-1910), swept 15 awards, including best picture and best actor, in the South Korean “Oscars” for this year.

Lee is the second Korean to receive the award following pop star Rain in 2007.
“I love challenging new things and have tried them without fear. But at the same time I am scared and alone.

Actors of the upcoming drama “IRIS II” pose with Kia Motors’ New K7 during the car’s launching event at a Seoul hotel on Nov. 13. ( Kia Motors)
Kia Motors’ K7 sedan was once called “Lee Byung-hun’s car” after the Korean Wave heartthrob drove the car in the several chase scenes of the 2009 hit spy thriller “IRIS.”
Company officials would not offer the specific sales data on the drama sponsorship. But during the eight months after the drama ended, the K7 topped the nation’s large sedan segment sales, outperforming Hyundai Motor’s steady-seller Grandeur.
Unveiling the facelift version of the K7 recently, the carmaker, an affiliate of Hyundai Motor, is betting this time on the drama’s sequel “IRIS II,” which is slated to air in February.
“The K7 became a smash hit with the drama ‘IRIS.’ The New K7 also will join the main actors of the upcoming ‘IRIS II,’” Seo Chun-kwan, Kia’s marketing director, said at the car’s launching event.
Amid a proliferation of drama productions in Korea and their better quality, carmakers are paying renewed attention to placing their products in TV dramas.
There are two options for marketers to slip their vehicles into TV shows here.
Through a deal with the state-sponsored Korea Broadcast Advertising Corporation, carmakers can show the logos of their vehicles by paying 10 million to 40 million won ($9,000-37,000) for a 10-second exposure.
Or they can directly sponsor a drama. In this case, the cost could surge to hundreds of millions of won depending on detailed contract conditions and they are not allowed to reveal the logos.
Despite the higher cost, most carmakers are opting for the latter as they can expose their vehicles constantly throughout the storylines.
Currently almost all prime-time shows feature sponsored cars for their main characters, with many of them being chaebol family members.
The Citroen DS3 for KBS’ “Ohlala Couple”
BMW offers its vehicles to SBS’ “Five Fingers,” Volvo for MBC’s “Here Goes Oh Ja-ryong,” Peugeot-Citroen for KBS “Ohlala Couple” and another KBS drama “My Daughter Seo-young,” Nissan for “Innocent Man,” and so on.
In terms of viewer ratings, French brands Peugeot and Citroen may have made the best deal as the weekender “My Daughter Seo-young” is enjoying high viewership.
Citroen, in particular, which made its Korean debut this year, is successfully appealing to local customers still unfamiliar with the brand and its vehicles.
“I would not say our appearance in the drama is directly affecting car sales. But more customers are visiting our dealerships and asking about the cars,” said Joe Han, a PR manager at Hanbul Motors, the official Korean importer of Citroen.
Mercedes-Benz took a smarter strategy, weaving its new M-class SUV directly into the storylines of the recently concluded hit drama “A Gentleman’s Dignity.”
The Mercedes-Benz Ml 63 AMG for SBS’ “A Gentleman’s Dignity”
In the drama, the main character, played by actor Jang Dong-gun, never hesitates to show his affection for the car, naming it “Betty,” which sometimes causes his girlfriend to get jealous.
After he mentioned the car in the drama, the carmaker said its dealerships were flooded with phone calls.
“Mercedes-Benz was more known for its sedan models in Korea. With the aim of increasing customers’ awareness about our SUV models, we designed the sponsorship from the beginning and the plan worked perfectly,” said Choi Yoon-sun, a spokesperson of Mercedes-Benz Korea.
As much as the effectiveness of a successful drama product placement is proved, however, carmakers are concerned about the soaring costs.
An executive at an import car brand said his company had to give up sponsoring a drama production recently due to the “excessive demands” of the mediating PR agency.
“In the past, we used to offer vehicles only. But now it is common that production companies ask for additional funding,” he said on condition of anonymity.
Industry watchers predict more carmakers would use product placement as it is still less expensive but more effective than regular TV commercials.
“Viewers seem more tolerant when products appear in the show, while they turn channels to skip TV commercials. But marketers need to know product placement should be integrated into the context, not added on too obviously,” said a PR agency official, declining to be named.

Director Choo Chang-min’s period drama “Gwanghae: the Man Who Became the King” (Masquerade) swept the 49th Daejong Film (Grand Bell) Film Awards on Tuesday, winning 15 prizes including the best picture, best director and best actor. Meanwhile, Venice film fest-winning “Pieta” director Kim Ki-duk left during the ceremony.
Kim’s “Pieta,” which had been nominated for six awards, including best director and best picture, received the best actress award. Director Kim was given a special jury prize for the bleak morality tale, but left the venue before his name was announced. Kim is said to have left for “health reasons,” and the film’s producer Kim Soon-mo received the prize on his behalf.

“He left out of the blue without telling any of us,” said Park Jun-kyung from NEW, the local distributor of “Pieta.”
Producer Kim was unavailable for comment. NEW said they are not sure whether Kim had been notified from the organizers about his winning of the special jury prize. Many local media outlets have speculated that Kim left the venue as he was upset about not winning other awards that “Pieta” had been nominated for.
“Gwanghae” tells the engaging story of King Gwanghae, the 15th ruler of Joseon (1392-1910). Mega hallyu star Lee Byung-hun played dual roles for the film, as the king and the fictional Ha-sun, a street actor who ends up standing in for the ruler when he is poisoned and taken ill.
The movie surpassed the 10 million mark in attendance earlier this month, becoming the second local film this year to reach the milestone after “The Thieves.” Its producer and distributor CJ E&M spent 3 billion won just on the marketing of the film, on top of 6 billion won spent on production. The company was criticized for its hold on theaters for the movie, as CJ CGV, the largest multiplex chain in Korea, is its division.
Actor Lee, who could not attend the ceremony at the KBS Hall as he is shooting a Hollywood action-comedy “Red 2” in London, England, received two prizes for the role in the film: the best actor and special popularity prizes.
The film also won the best costume design, best editing, best screenplay and best sound mixing awards
“I’d like to thank all the crew members, actors and actresses,” said director Choo after receiving the best director prize on Tuesday.
“I’d also like to thank all the viewers of this film, as well as my loving parents and my wife.”
Meanwhile, actress Cho Min-soo won the top prize for her role in Kim Ki-duk’s Venice-winning film “Pieta.” In the film, she starred as the mysterious woman who visits a loan shark and claims to be his long-lost, biological mother.

“I wouldn’t be standing here if I did not work with director Kim, my co-star Lee Jeong-jin, and the 24 crew members of this movie,” the actress said after receiving the best actress prize. “This film ‘Pieta’ has given me so many precious memories.”
Up-and-coming actress Kim Go-eun won the best new actress prize for her performance as the reckless high school girl who falls for a poet in his 70s in Jeong Ji-woo’s erotic drama “Eungyo.”
“This is such an honor and I’m overwhelmed,” said Kim, tearing up. “I’d like to thank those who have been very supportive.”
Actor Kim Seong-kyun, who starred as the serial killer in Kim Hwi’s thriller “The Neighbor” won the best new actor for the role.
Actor Ryu Seung-ryong won the best supporting actor prize for his performance in “Gwanghae,” while actress Kim Hae-sook won best supporting actress for her role as one of the thieves in Choi Dong-hun’s star-studded blockbuster “The Thieves.”
Meanwhile, film producer and director Kimjo Gwangsu openly criticized the juries and organizers of the awards via his Twitter account, calling the annual event unfair.
“I think it’s rather a dishonor to win the prizes,” he wrote. “Anyone who can actually think in the film industry would not care about the awards.”

A scene from “Gwanghae: The Man Who Became King (Masquerade)” (CJ Entertainment)
On Saturday, local period film “Gwanghae: the Man Who Became the King” (Masquerade) surpassed the 10 million mark in attendance, becoming the second Korean film this year to reach the milestone.
The film reached the mark in just 38 days, only about two months after director Choi Dong-hun’s star-studded heist film “The Thieves” achieved the same feat. Only five other local films, including Bong Jun-ho’s 2006 monster flick “The Host” and Yoon Je-kyoon’s disaster film “Haeundae,” have ever passed the 10 million mark.
The Korean Film Council is calling this year “the renaissance” or heyday of Korean films, as it is the first time that two local films have broken the 10 million milestone in the same year. Local auteur Kim Ki-duk also made the headlines by winning the top prize at this year’s Venice Film Festival for his bleak morality tale “Pieta” ― becoming the first Korean filmmaker to win the award.
However, both “The Thieves” and “Gwanghae” are products of two of the three biggest local film distributors ― CJ E&M, Lotte Entertainment and Showbox/Mediaplex ― which are often criticized for their hold on theaters in the country. CJ CGV, the largest multiplex chain in Korea is a division of CJ E&M. Lotte Cinema and Lotte Entertainment belong to Lotte Confectionary Co., Ltd. Showbox/Mediaplex is tied to to MegaBox, another multiplex chain in Korea.
“Gwanghae,” especially, was a three-year project for CJ E&M ― the company invested in the film as well as producing and distributing it. CJ E&M spent some 3 billion won just on the marketing of the film, on top of 6 billion won spent on production. Meanwhile, Kim Ki-duk could only afford 700 million won to market his Venice-winning “Pieta.”
“Gwanghae” does have its merits. Directed by Choo Chang-min and starring hallyu mega star Lee Byung-hun, the film tells the engaging story of King Gwanghae, the 15th ruler of Joseon (1392-1910). Lee plays dual roles as the king and the fictional Ha-sun, a street actor who ends up standing in for the ruler when he is poisoned and taken ill.
An entertaining yet moving account of a stand-in ruler who strives to serve the people and their interests, the film was calculatedly released just a few months ahead the upcoming presidential election. Democratic United Party presidential candidate Moon Jae-in watched the film and met with director Choo and its producer Won Dong-yeon after many viewers suggested the role of Ha-sun reminded them of late President Roh Moo-hyun. Moon served as the former chief of staff to late Roh.
However, many still criticize the big distributors. Director Kim Ki-duk famously criticized the distributor of “The Thieves” during a press meeting last month. “Some movies dominate the local theaters simply because they want to hit the 10 million mark,” he told reporters. “Now that’s very much like real thieves.”
A film producer, who wanted to remain anonymous, said it’s always been difficult for small-scale distributors to secure theaters.
“It’s not a fair game to begin with,” he said. “Of course, more people will see your film if they are screened all day, everyday, 24/7, in every single theater in the country.”
“We gave about 200 theaters out of 800 we have for ‘Gwanghae,’” Kim Dae-hee from CJ CGV told The Korea Herald. “And we normally give about 330 theaters to Hollywood blockbusters, so ‘Gwanghae’ isn’t actually dominating the screens.”
Lee Yong-sun, a researcher at KOFIC, said the state-run organization has been working on a number of projects to support independent and small-scale films.
“It’s a systemic problem,” he said. “We know it’s difficult for them to secure theaters to screen their works. We’ve been working on a number of projects to support them, including an official contract which requires the theaters to screen their works for the duration of the contracted time.”

Hallyu stars Lee Byung-hun and Lee Min-jung admitted on Sunday that they have been dating since early this year. The two celebrities said they are in a “serious relationship” but denied rumors that they are getting married in November.
“I found someone I want to be with. Now she (Lee Min-jung) has become the most important person for me and I want to take this relationship seriously,” the 42-year-old actor wrote on his official website.
The 30-year-old actress also said, “I want to tell all of you that we are dating as lovers.”

The two have been denying rumors that they have been dating and that their wedding is imminent. However, speculation of the two being involved in a romantic relationship went on as they were spotted having dinner together.
Rumors of the two getting married spread quickly after an industry insider revealed that the two have recently visited a hanbok shop to tailor Korean traditional clothes to get married in November.
“We feel sorry that we were not able to tell the truth but feel responsible to tell our fans first about our relationship,” the actor said.
Lee said that he first met the actress accompanied by his friends many years ago and have exchanging messages since then. “Early this year, we met again in a casual meeting and carefully started to build a relationship,” the actor said.
The actress also apologized to her fans of denying the relationship and said she wanted to tell them after she felt secure and was assured of her romantic relationship with Lee. But she maintained a firm “No” to wedding rumors.
“The November wedding is a false report. We are not doing anything about it,” she added.
The actor has been in the international spotlight since he took a supporting role of the herioic “Storm Shadow” in the recent “G. I. Joe” Hollywood action film series. He recently filmed his first period drama “King of Joseon,” which is slated to be released in late fall.
The actress rose to stardom with the supporting role in the popular teenage drama “Boys over Flowers” in 2008.
She took a leading role in her first romantic comedy “Cyrano Agency” in 2010 and also starred in another romantic comedy film “Wonderful Radio” in 2012. She recently starred in the KBS TV drama “Big,” which ended in late July.

'띠동갑' 이병헌-이민정 '사귑니다' 인정
한류스타 이병헌(42)과 배우 이민정(30)이 결혼을 전제로 진지하게 만나고 있다고 19일 밝혔다.
두 사람은 이날 각자 자신의 공식 홈페이지를 통해 이런 사실을 공개했다.
이병헌은 ""저에게 함께 하고픈 사람이 생겼다""며 ""이제 (이민정은) 제겐 가장 소중한 사람이 되었다. 그리고 이 관계를 진중하게 이어가고자 한다""고 밝혔다.
또 이민정은 ""저희 두 사람이 연인으로 진지한 만남을 갖고 있음을 말씀드린다""라고 말했다.
앞서 두 사람은 지난봄 열애설을 낳았으나 이를 부인했다.
이병헌은 ""저희 두 사람 모두 팬 분들께 먼저 말씀드리는 것이 도리라고 생각되어 함께 글을 올리기로 결심했다""는 말로 이날 열애사실을 공개하는 배경을 밝혔다.
그러면서 ""피치 못하게 잠시나마 진실을 밝히지 못했던 점에 대해서는 여러분들께 이해를 부탁드리기 전 진심으로 죄송하다는 말씀드린다""며 열애설에 대한 뒤늦은 '인정'을 사과했다.
그는 ""지인을 통해 여러 사람과 함께하는 자리에서 처음 알게 된 이민정 양과 자주는 아니었어도 서로 안부를 묻고 지내온 것은 이미 여러 해 전이었다""며 ""그러던 중 올해 초 우연한 자리에서 다시 만나게 되었고 그 후로 조심스럽게 만남을 가지기 시작하며 비로소 진지하게 이성으로서의 감정이 싹트기 시작한 것이 아니었나 생각되어진다""고 설명했다.
그는 이민정에 대해 ""오랫동안 동료로서 함께하며 보아 온 그녀는 주변까지도 밝게 만드는 마음마저 건강한 좋은 사람이라 생각되었다""고 밝혔다.
이병헌은 그간 조심스럽게 서로를 알아가던 중 퍼져버린 열애설에 크게 당황했다며 가족이나 각자 소속사와의 관계도 있다 보니 감정에만 치우쳐 경솔하지 않으려 좀 더 신중하고 싶었던 것이 그간 열애설을 부정할 수밖에 없었던 이유였다고 전했다.
이민정 역시 지난봄 열애설을 부인한 데 사과하며 ""시간이 좀 더 지나고 제 판단이나 믿음 그 모든 것들이 좀 더 단단해지고 확고해진 후에 용기를 내어 여러분에게 솔직하게 말씀드리려 했다""면서 ""지금 더 이상 번복이나 부인을 하며 거짓을 말하는 것은 아니라는 판단에 선배님(이병헌)과 의논하여 서로 글로써 저희 입장을 담기로 했다""고 말했다.
이민정은 그러나 결혼설은 선을 그었다.
그는 ""11월 결혼설은 잘못된 정보""라며 ""아직 저희 두 사람은 결혼에 대한 그 어떤 것도 준비하고 있지 않았으며 정해진 것들도 없다""고 말했다.
이민정은 ""아직도 여전히 조심스럽지만 저희 두 사람이 진지하게 만나고 있고 앞으로 좋은 소식이 정해지면 이제는 여러분께 먼저 말씀드리겠다""며 ""한 여자로서 배우로서 그리고 딸로서 많은 고민과 걱정이 있었지만 이제는 용기를 내고자 한다.
여러분에게 고백함으로써 여러분의 응원 속에서 행복을 만들어가려 한다""고 밝혔다.

Ten Korean films including “Unbowed,” “Poetry,” and “Thirst,” were screened during the two-day festival.

“I can’t believe I just got my handprints here. It’s an incredible moment because I used to take pictures in front of the handprints of Hollywood actors and actresses,” said Lee at the ceremony.
Lee appeared in the Hollywood blockbuster movie “G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra” in 2009.
“It’s been a tremendous honor to leave my handprints and footprints here with other big stars,” said Ahn Sung-ki, one of the most respected and popular actors in Korea.
Ahn played a leading role in the Korean courtroom drama “Unbowed” released earlier this year.
Lee and Ahn join a long list of Hollywood stars to have participated in the same event since the ceremony started in 1927.
The stars honored with handprints include Elizabeth Taylor, Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise.
Hong Kong movie director John Woo was the first Asian to have left his prints in Hollywood in 2002.

Shooting his second Hollywood film required a number of things of actor Lee Byung-hun, including mastering every script line in a perfect American accent and getting used to the extremely strict shooting schedule.
The hallyu megastar is returning as the famously heroic “Storm Shadow” character in his upcoming sci-fi film “G.I. Joe: Retaliation,” which is a sequel to the 2009 picture “G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra.”
“In Korea, things can be flexible if an actor is sick or isn’t in his or her best condition,” Lee told reporters in a press meeting promoting his upcoming action in southern Seoul, Wednesday.
“So if you are seriously ill, you can re-schedule your shooting schedule. But that’s simply not the case in Hollywood. The production cost for each and every shooting day is just colossal there, so even if you’ve broken your leg you’d still have to show up at the set. Everything is pre-planned in every single detail, so you’d always start and finish each day’s work on time. I found the system very efficient, but also a bit scary and intimidating at times.”
Actor Lee Byung-hun speaks at a press meeting held in promotion of his upcoming film “G.I. Joe: Retaliation” at CGV Apgujeong, southern Seoul, Wednesday. (1st Look)
Both the 2009 and the upcoming films are based on American board game company Hasbro’s toy and cartoon series. While Lee is returning as the same Storm Shadow, the heroic character who works as a ninja bodyguard in the first film, other casts and director have been changed.
The upcoming picture is directed by Jon M. Chu, while starring top Hollywood actors Bruce Willis and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson along with Lee. The hallyu star said shooting the sequel was certainly easier than the first one, but the language barrier and getting used to the strict schedule were still a challenge for him to overcome.
“I’d memorize each and every line perfectly before going to the shoot,” the actor told reporters.
“But I’d just forget every line ― literally every single line ― when I’m told that I’ve pronounced one word wrong while acting. Having to think that I somehow have to fix my pronunciation for that one word would just make me totally lost at the set. There’s a huge difference between making conversation in a foreign language and acting in a foreign language. I feel the most comfortable when I perform for pieces that are based on Korean culture. So I can’t help but feel that I could’ve done better if this were a Korean movie.”
Though he felt it was too “strict” at times, Lee said the efficient Hollywood system offers a lot to learn.
“Compared to Korean movies, pre-production phase is much longer for Hollywood films,” said Lee. “Because they perfectly plan out everything in advance, the actual production period is a lot shorter. I think it’s a lot more efficient that way and maybe things can be done in a similar way here.”
When a reporter asked if it bothers Lee in any way that his Storm Shadow character can be seen as another American stereotype of Asian men, the actor said he thought the character was “something that he had to do” in his foray into Hollywood.
“I didn’t necessarily decide to play this character because I loved it so much,” Lee said. “Right now I’m not given with a lot of choices in Hollywood. I thought this character was something that I had to do in my first steps of breaking into their world. And maybe I will be given with more choices once I do this character very well, though he maybe another Asian male stereotype.”
The top actor was reported to be dating popular actress Lee Min-jeong earlier this month. Both he and Lee denied the reports. Prior to the press meeting, reporters were asked not to ask him any “personal questions” and inquire only about the upcoming movie.
Lee is currently shooting his first period drama “King of Joseon,” which is slated to be released in late fall.

Heartthrob Hyun was awarded the grand prize in the TV category for his role in the hit SBS TV series “Secret Garden.” Hyun became one of the nation’s most popular actors after he played the main character, an obnoxious but cute department store owner, in the drama.

Nominating him for the the grand prize, the awards show aired a video message from Hyun at his military camp in Baekryeong Island. The actor could not make it to the awards because he is currently undergoing his military service. He joined the Marine Corps in March.
“I am so happy to be one of the nominees along with great actors. Though I cannot be there right now, I wish today will be a successful day for our staff and actors,” said Hyun in the video.
“I am at Baekryeong Island, the northernmost area. I will carry out my duties faithfully here in the northwestern region, and will be faithful to our people and the Marine Corps,” he added.
Lee took home the grand prize with the movie “I Saw the Devil” which was released last year. He starred as a vengeful agent at the National Intelligence Service.
“Thank you for giving this prize to me, who is not even tall,” said Lee, jokingly.
“Choi Min-sik, who taught me what kind of energy actors can show, is who first comes to my mind. I ascribe this honor to director Kim Ji-woon who gave me advice as a friend and as an enemy, and all the staff and actors,” he said.
Lee will be leaving for the U.S. for the shooting of the sequel of the movie “G.I. Joe” which opened 2009. Lee, who will be continuing his role of Storm Shadow, said that he wanted to “show them that Asian actors can do more than do nice kicks.”
The Best Actor and Actress awards for the movie category went to Ha Jeong-woo of the film “The Yellow Sea” and to Chinese actress Tang Wei of “Late Autumn.” In the TV category, the prizes went to actor Jeong Bo-seok of the SBS TV series “Giant” and actress Han Hyo-joo of MBC’s “Dongi.”

The amount surpassed the 8.65 billion won collected in a month last year to help earthquake victims in Haiti, the charity added.
Lump sum donations were made by Korean Wave stars, with Lee Byung-hun and Choi Ji-woo, both extremely popular in Japan, giving 700 million won and 200 million won, respectively.
KB Financial Group Inc. and Woori Finance Holdings Co. also donated 1 billion won each through the charity, while Hyundai Motors Group and GS Group offered 100 million yen ($1.23 million) and 50 million yen, respectively.
Individual donations are also flowing in to help Japanese quake victims.

One office worker, who recently cancelled a trip to Japan, sent 500,000 won from her travel budget, while a couple donated 1 million won in the name of their baby who marked its 100th day of birth.
The charity added that more than 100 individuals and organizations have applied for volunteer work in Japan through its online website.
Second Korean found dead
A second South Korean death in quake-hit Japan was confirmed on Sunday, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
The 37-year-old woman, who was married to a Japanese man, resided in Ishinomaki, Miyagi Prefecture, one of the areas hit hardest by the quake and tsunami. She was the second Korean death confirmed as of Monday.
On March 14, a 40-year-old Korean worker was found dead near the construction site of a thermal power plant in Ibaraki Prefecture.
Of the 1,019 Korean nationals reported missing to the Korean Consulate General in Sendai, 41 people were still missing, the ministry said.
Amid a growing nuclear scare over the stricken Fukushima nuclear power plant, the 107-person Korean rescue team completed its search from Sendai to the western coastal city of Niigata on Saturday.
“Other than dangers of radiation leaks, we almost finished the relief work in the region requested by the Japanese government,” said a Foreign Ministry official.
“The team will be waiting for an additional request in Niigata while overcoming fatigue.”
The Korean crew has found 17 bodies in the northeastern coast region since March 14.

According to the Seoul Metropolitan Government, the number of visitors to nine of its websites run in Japanese, English and Chinese marked 5,057,465 last year, about 15 times that of its official Korean site (www.seoul.go.kr).
The lion’s share went to Chinese with 28 million visiting the video streaming site (shouer.youku.com).
More than 68.8 million people have visited the site since June 2008, when the city government first opened it on Xina.com, one of China’s largest portal sites. The most popular content was the city’s tourism promotion video clip starring pop group Wonder Girls, marking 1.3 million page views.
About 1.2 million English users visited youtube.com/seouldreamseries and the most popular item was the online B-boy battle clip, drawing 617,037 clicks.
More than 120,000 Japanese users visited three sites ― blogs.yahoo.co.jp/hi_seoul_travel, seoul.blogs.yahoo.co.jp and youtube.com/hiseoul ― which were established in May. Actor Lee Byung-hun’s TV advertisement drew the most attention.
The city administration’s marketing department selected China and Japan as the “core” regions for promotion, Southeast Asian countries as a “focused” region, as well as the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Australia and others as “with potential” regions. But with the overseas marketing budget cut down to 990 million won ($88,390) this year from 2.5 billion won last year, events and promotions will be downsized, officials said.
“Since much of the content is softer than that uploaded on official sites, people like it and become easily attached. The cutback of the budget is a challenge but we will manage,” Kang Young-gyu, head of the marketing department, said.
